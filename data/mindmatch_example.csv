1,Murat Çetkin,"Hair whorl direction and handedness were stated to have a common genetic basis in the random recessive model. This study was carried out with a total of 317 healthy young males. The association between hair whorl swirling direction and handedness, footedness and eyedness were assessed. The direction of hair whorl was clockwise at a rate of 76.7%, and counter clock wise at a rate of 23.3%. There was no significant association between hair whorl direction and handedness, footedness, and eyedness (p > .05). The results indicate that hair whorl swirling direction is not an evident marker of functional laterality.",Selin Bayko;Tunç Kutoğlu
2,Lisa Marie Haraldseide,"Purpose: To explore if preoperative patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) provides additional prognostic value as a supplement to other preoperatively known clinical factors in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG).Methods: In a prospective explorative study, 114 patients with high-grade glioma were included. The participants completed the generic HRQoL questionnaire EQ-5D 3L, and the disease-specific questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BN20 1-3 days before surgery. Operating neurosurgeons scored the patient's preoperative functional level by using Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify HRQoL domains that were associated with survival. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Log-rank tests were used to visualize differences in survival between groups.Results: In addition to preoperative KPS and age, the EORTC QLQ-BN20 subdomains 'seizures' (HR 0.98, p < .006), 'itchy skin' (HR 1.01, p < .036) and 'bladder control' (HR 1.01, p < .023) were statistically significant independent predictors of survival in a multivariate cox model.Conclusions: Our results suggest that in patients with HGG, certain preoperative symptom scales within EORTC QLQ-BN20 may provide additional prognostic information to supplement other clinical prognostic factors. However, further studies are required to validate our findings. Overall the instruments EQ-5D 3L and EORTC QLQ-C30 do not seem to provide much additional valuable prognostic information to already known prognostic factors.",Asgeir Store Jakola;Ole Solheim;Lisa Millgård Sagberg
3,Joenilton Saturnino Cazé Da Silva,"Episodic memory (EM) is a subsystem responsible for storing and evoking information about the ""What"", ""Where"" and ""When"" elements of an event in an integrated way. This capacity depends of structures with hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The effect of aging on some capacities mediated by these areas, such as the influence of the number of objects on the coding of EM, remains unexplored. The present study examined the memory recall capacity of young and older adults in an EM task which used the number of 2, 4 and 6 items associated with specific space-temporal contexts. The young adults showed better performance coefficients than the older adults in all tasks, regardless of the load used, for all questions, except the ""What"" type. The group differences increase with load augmentation, stabilizing from the tasks with 4 items. In short, the EM efficiency, evaluated through What-Where-When Task, depends on the quantity information encoding.",Flávio Freitas Barbosa;Égina Karoline Gonçalves Da Fonsêca;Fabíola Da Silva Albuquerque;Lucy G Cheke;Bernardino Fernández-Calvo
4,Kelly A Durbin,"Research suggests that mood can moderate age differences in recognizing facial emotion. In this study, we examined how an anxious versus calm mood state affected younger and older adults' processing of emotional faces. Older adults had greater difficulty identifying negative emotions, particularly when emotions were displayed at a low intensity level. However, an anxious mood did not affect age differences in emotional face recognition. In contrast, age, emotional intensity, and current mood state all affected the perceived intensity of emotion. The effects of age and mood on perceived emotional intensity were only observed for low intensity facial expressions. When induced into an anxious mood, younger adults perceived threatening emotions (i.e., fear, anger) as more emotionally intense, whereas older adults perceived anger and happiness to be more intense. These findings emphasize the need to consider both internal and external factors when investigating the effects of age on emotional face processing.",Sarah Rastegar;Bob G Knight
5,Mckenna E Williams,"Although age-related memory differences between young and older adults have been well documented, fewer studies have investigated memory changes in middle age. We examined the performance of healthy middle-aged adults (40-55 years of age; n = 32) in relation to healthy young (18-25 years of age; n = 57) and older adults (65+ years of age; n = 55) on variations of recognition discriminability (RD) indices derived from the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II). Middle-aged adults performed significantly worse (ps < .05) than young adults on multiple RD indices that incorporate semantically related distractor items, suggesting memory changes in middle age may be associated with increased susceptibility to semantic interference. Moreover, middle-aged adults performed comparably to older adults across all RD indices, indicating the recognition profile of middle-aged adults on RD indices more closely resembles that of older adults than young adults.",Lisa V Graves;Emily J Van Etten;Heather M Holden;Lisa Delano-Wood;Mark W Bondi;Jody Corey-Bloom;Dean C Delis;Paul E Gilbert
6,Tomoyo Morita,"Visual self-face and proprioceptive postural recognition predominantly activate the right inferior frontoparietal cortices in human right-handers at the population level. In the present study, prompted by the finding that left-handedness may alter lateralized cortical organization for language, sensory-motor, and cognitive functions observed in right-handers, we investigated individual variations in right-dominant use of the cortices in 50 right-handers and 50 left-handers during self-body recognition (self-face and proprioceptive) tasks. We also investigated possible between-tasks differences in this right-dominant use, and possible atypical left-right reversed lateralization (right-dominance for language and left-dominance for self-body recognition) in left-handers. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants performed a proprioceptive postural recognition task (experiencing illusory movements of the left and the right hands), a visual self-face recognition (self-other distinction) task, and a language (verb generation) task. To evaluate hemispheric dominance, we computed individual lateralization indices for the inferior frontoparietal activities in these tasks. Left-handedness altered the right-hemispheric dominance that was observed in the majority of right-handed participants in both self-body recognition tasks. In the left-handed group, during proprioceptive recognition, participants with right-lateralization, bilaterality, or left-lateralization were equally distributed, and during self-face recognition, right-lateralization was still observed, though the number of participants who demonstrated left-lateralization increased. Atypical left-right reversed lateralization was only observed in left-handed participants, but during both self-body recognition tasks. The present study provides novel and valuable knowledge about right-hemispheric dominance in self-body recognition affected by left-handedness. We discuss how functional lateralization of self-body recognition is shaped in human brain, in terms of handedness, language lateralization, and development.",Minoru Asada;Eiichi Naito
7,Chun-Hao Wang,"Motor expertise has recently been associated with differences in domain-general cognition. Studies using averaged neurophysiological signals (e.g., event-related potentials) have shown varying degree of expertise-related differences in neural activity. As a result, the precise mechanisms underlying these differences remain to be described. Here we used multiscale entropy analysis (MSE) to investigate whether the complexity of underlying neural systems working in a wide-range time scales can better explain the cognitive characteristics of athletes with different domains of expertise. Behavioral and electroencephalograms (EEG) measures of athletes practicing an interceptive sport (badminton; n = 17) or a static sport (long-distance running; n = 17) were assessed during a flanker task with varying degrees of response conflict. The interceptive sport players showed superior behavioral performance overall on the task relative to the static sport players. Although both groups exhibited greater sample entropy across most time scales in high-conflict relative to low-conflict trials over the parietal site, this effect was only evident at coarser time scales over the midfrontal site for the interceptive sport players. Together, our results suggest that individual differences in motor expertise may be associated with difference in information-processing capacity and information integration during cognitive processing, as demonstrated by differential cognitive modulation of brain signal variability.",Wei-Kuang Liang;David Moreau
8,Ricardo Piña,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent psychiatric childhood disorder, characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity and impaired attention, treated most frequently with methylphenidate (MPH). For children and adults with ADHD who do not respond satisfactorily or do not tolerate well stimulants such as MPH or D-Amphetamine, for them the alternative is to use Atomoxetine (ATX), a norepinephrine (NE) transporter inhibitor that increase extracellular NE. We examined the effects of ATX on behavior and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the murine prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) model of ADHD. ADHD symptoms were measured using behavioral tests, open field for hyperactivity and the Y-maze for spatial working memory. Further, ATX effects on long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices at the CA3-CA1 synapse were assessed. PNE mice exhibited the behavioral deficits of ADHD, hyperactivity and spatial memory impairment. Intraperitoneal injection of ATX (2 mg/kg/day) normalized these behaviors significantly after 7 days. In PNE mice LTP was reduced (110.6 ± 4.5% %; n = 7) compared to controls (148.9 ± 5.2%; n = 7; p < 0.05). ATX administration (5 µM) reestablished the LTP in PNE mice to levels similar to the controls (157.7 ± 6.3%; n = 7). Paired-pulse ratios (PPR) were not significantly different for any condition. These results indicate that administration of ATX in a PNE model of ADHD reestablishes TBS-dependent LTP in CA3-CA1 synapses. The results suggest postsynaptic changes in synaptic plasticity as part of the mechanisms that underlie improvement of ADHD symptoms induced by ATX.",Carlos Rozas;Darwin Contreras;Paulina Hardy;Gonzalo Ugarte;Marc L Zeise;Patricio Rojas;Bernardo Morales
9,Moriya Ben Yakir-Blumkin,"Static magnetic field (SMF) is gaining interest as a potential technique for modulating CNS neuronal activity. Previous studies have shown a pro-neurogenic effect of short periods of extremely low frequency pulsatile magnetic fields (PMF) in vivo and pro-survival effect of low intensity SMF in cultured neurons in vitro, but little is known about the in vivo effects of low to moderate intensity SMF on brain functions. We investigated the effect of continuously-applied SMF on subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis and immature doublecortin (DCX)-expressing cells in the neocortex of young adult rats and in primary cultures of cortical neurons in vitro. A small (3 mm diameter) magnetic disc was implanted on the skull of rats at bregma, producing an average field strength of 4.3 mT at SVZ and 12.9 mT at inner neocortex. Levels of proliferation of SVZ stem cells were determined by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) labelling, and early neuronal phenotype development was determined by expression of doublecortin (DCX). To determine the effect of SMF on neurogenesis in vitro, permanent magnets were placed beneath the culture dishes. We found that low intensity SMF exposure enhances cell proliferation in SVZ and new DCX-expressing cells in neocortical regions of young adult rats. In primary cortical neuronal cultures, SMF exposure increased the expression of newly generated cells co-labelled with EdU and DCX or the mature neuronal marker NeuN, while activating a set of pro neuronal bHLH genes. SMF exposure has potential for treatment of neurodegenerative disease and conditions such as CNS trauma and affective disorders in which increased neurogenesis is desirable.",Yelena Loboda;Levi Schächter;John P M Finberg
10,George M Opie,"The effects of muscle fatigue are known to be altered in older adults, and age-related changes in the brain are likely to be a contributing factor. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these changes are not known. The aim of the current study was to use transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to investigate age-related changes in cortical excitability with muscle fatigue. In 23 young (mean age ± SD: 22 ± 2 years) and 17 older (mean age ± SD: 68.3 ± 5.6 years) adults, single-pulse TMS-EEG was applied before, during and after the performance of fatiguing, intermittent isometric abduction of the index finger. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) measures of cortical excitability were increased during (estimated mean difference, 123.3%; P < 0.0001) and after (estimated mean difference, 117.5%; P = 0.001) fatigue and this was not different between groups (P > 0.5). For TMS-EEG, the amplitude of the P30 and P180 potentials were unaffected by fatigue in older participants (P > 0.05). In contrast, the amplitude of the N45 potential in older adults was significantly reduced both during (positive cluster: mean voltage difference = 0.7 µV, P < 0.005; negative cluster: mean voltage difference = 0.9 µV, P < 0.0005) and after (mean voltage difference = 0.5 µV, P < 0.005) fatiguing exercise, whereas this response was absent in young participants. These results suggest that performance of maximal intermittent isometric exercise in old but not young adults is associated with modulation of cortical inhibition likely mediated by activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors.",Lavender A Otieno;Maryam Pourmajidian;John G Semmler;Simranjit K Sidhu
11,C Lee,"Endolymphatic hydrops is associated with low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, with a large body of research dedicated to examining its putative causal role in low-frequency hearing loss. Investigations have been thwarted by the fact that hearing loss is measured in intact ears, but gold standard assessments of endolymphatic hydrops are made postmortem only; and that no objective low-frequency hearing measure has existed. Yet the association of endolymphatic hydrops with low-frequency hearing loss is so strong that it has been established as one of the important defining features for Ménière's disease, rendering it critical to detect endolymphatic hydrops early, regardless of whether it serves a causal role or is the result of other disease mechanisms. We surgically induced endolymphatic hydrops in guinea pigs and employed our recently developed objective neural measure of low-frequency hearing, the Auditory Nerve Overlapped Waveform (ANOW). Hearing loss and endolymphatic hydrops were assessed at various time points after surgery. The ANOW detected low-frequency hearing loss as early as the first day after surgery, well before endolymphatic hydrops was found histologically. The ANOW detected low-frequency hearing loss with perfect sensitivity and specificity in all ears after endolymphatic hydrops developed, where there was a strong linear relationship between degree of endolymphatic hydrops and severity of low-frequency hearing loss. Further, histological data demonstrated that endolymphatic hydrops is seen first in the high-frequency cochlear base, though the ANOW demonstrated that dysfunction begins in the low-frequency apical cochlear half. The results lay the groundwork for future investigations of the causal role of endolymphatic hydrops in low-frequency hearing loss.",C V Valenzuela;S S Goodman;D Kallogjeri;C A Buchman;J T Lichtenhan
12,Devry Mourra,"The role of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) in regulating appetitive behavior continues to be controversial. Earlier literature suggests that reduced D2R signaling diminishes motivated behavior while more recent theories suggest that reduced D2R, as has been putatively observed in obesity, facilitates compulsive appetitive behavior and promotes overeating. Using a homecage foraging paradigm with mice, we revisit classic neuroleptic pharmacological studies from the 1970s that led to the 'extinction mimicry' hypothesis: that dopamine blockade reduces reinforcement leading to an extinction-like reduction in a learned, motivated behavior. We complement this with a selective genetic deletion of D2R in indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs). Administration of haloperidol shifts foraging strategy toward less effortful, more thrifty pursuit of food without altering consumption or bodyweight. D2R deletion in iMSNs also reduces effort and energy expended toward food pursuit, but without a compensatory shift in foraging strategy, resulting in loss of body weight, an effect more pronounced under conditions of escalating costs as the knockouts fail to adequately increase effort. The selective knockouts exhibit no change in sucrose preference or sucrose reinforcement. These data suggest that striatal D2R regulates effort in response to costs, mediating cost sensitivity and behavioral thrift. In the context of obesity, these data suggest that reduced D2R is more likely to diminish effort and behavioral energy expenditure rather than increase appetitive motivation and consumption, possibly contributing to reduced physical activity commonly observed in obesity.",Federico Gnazzo;Steve Cobos;Jeff A Beeler
13,Yuhang Gong,"GPR40 was utilized as the drug target to the treatment of diabetes, but the function and mechanisms ameliorating the Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unknown. In present study, the typical APP/PS1 mouse model was applied to explore the function and mechanism of GPR40 in AD. GPR40 agonist GW9508 and antagonist GW1100 were respectively given by i.c.v. injection to activate/inhibit the GPR40 in the brain of APP/PS1 mice which illustrated the function and mechanism of GPR40 in ameliorating AD symptoms. Morris water maze test, step-through test, Y-maze spontaneous alternation test, open field test and new object recognition test were used to test the cognitive function and memory ability of mice, while molecular biology experiments such as Western blot, immunofluorescence, JC-1 were used to detect the corresponding changes of signal pathways. The results revealed that treatment with GW9508 could significantly ameliorate cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 mice, upregulate the expression levels of cAMP, p-CREB and neurotrophic factors in vivo, while GW9508 also ameliorate Aβ1-42-induced neuron damage and downregulate the expression levels of pathological protein such as p-JNK, JNK and apoptosis-related proteins such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and caspase-3 in vitro. Meanwhile, high-content screening also showed that GW9508 promoted the cellular differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, while GW1100 reversed the effects of GW9508. These results suggested that GPR40 was an underlying therapeutic target for the treatment of AD and GPR40 agonist could be explored as the emerging AD therapeutic drug.",Jingjing Chen;Yongzeng Jin;Chen Wang;Menglin Zheng;Ling He
14,James Dowsett,"BACKGROUND
The ability to record brain activity in humans during movement, and in real world environments, is an important step towards understanding cognition. Electroencephalography (EEG) is well suited to mobile applications but suffers from the problem of artefacts introduced into the signal during movement. Steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) give an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and averaging a sufficient number of trials will eventually remove any noise not phase locked to the visual flicker.


NEW METHOD
Here we present a method for producing SSVEPs of real world environments using modified LCD shutter glasses, which are commonly used for 3D TV, by adapting the glass to flicker at neurophysiologically relevant frequencies (alpha band). Participants viewed a room whilst standing and walking. Either the left or right side of the room was illuminated, to test if it is possible to recover the resulting SSVEPs when walking, as well as to probe the effect of walking on neural activity. Additionally, by using a signal generator to produce ""simulated SSVEPs"" on the scalp we can demonstrate that this method is able to accurately recover evoked neural responses during walking.


RESULTS
The amplitude of SSVEPs over right parietal cortex was reduced by walking. Furthermore, the waveform and phase of the SSVEPs is highly preserved between walking and standing, but was sensitive to whether the left or right side of the room was illuminated.


CONCLUSIONS
This method allows probing neural responses during natural movements within real environments, potentially at a wide range of frequencies.",Marianne Dieterich;Paul C J Taylor
15,Peyman Najafi,"In recent years, studying the central mechanism of itch has gained momentum. However, a proper meta-analysis has not been conducted in this domain. In this study, we tried to respond to this need. A systematic search and a meta-analysis were carried out to estimate the central mechanism of itch. The itch matrix comprises the thalamus and the parietal, secondary somatosensory, insular and cingulate cortices. We have shown that the basal ganglia (BG) play an important role in itch reduction. Finally, we explored itch processing in AD patients and observed that the itch matrix in these patients was different. In conclusion, this is the first meta-analysis on the central mechanisms of itch perception and processing. Our study demonstrated that different modalities of itch induction can produce a common pattern of activity in the brain and provided further insights into understanding the underlying nature of itch central perception.",Jean-Luc Carré;Douraied Ben Salem;Emilie Brenaut;Laurent Misery;Olivier Dufor
16,Rafael Guimarães Dos Santos,"Serotoninergic hallucinogens include drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and psilocybin. Recent trials with single/few doses of these compounds show that they induce rapid and sustained antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive effects. These effects are also observed in religious groups using the DMT-containing brew ayahuasca. The agonist action of these substances on 5-HT2A receptors expressed in frontal and limbic areas increase glutamatergic transmission and neuroplasticity. These neurochemical effects are associated with acute alterations on self-perception and increases in introspection and positive mood, and with subacute and long-term decreases in psychiatric symptoms, increases in some personality traits such as openness, improvements in emotional processing, and increases in empathy. These are preliminary but promising results that should be further explored in controlled trials with larger sample sizes, especially considering that these compounds could be beneficial in the treatment of treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders.",Jaime Eduardo Cecilio Hallak
17,Nelly Alia-Klein,"This review of the neuroscience of anger is part of The Human Affectome Project, where we attempt to map anger and its components (i.e., physiological, cognitive, experiential) to the neuroscience literature (i.e., genetic markers, functional imaging of human brain networks) and to linguistic expressions used to describe anger feelings. Given the ubiquity of anger in both its normative and chronic states, specific language is used in humans to express states of anger. Following a review of the neuroscience literature, we explore the language that is used to convey angry feelings, as well as metaphors reflecting inner states of anger experience. We then discuss whether these linguistic expressions can be mapped on to the neural circuits during anger experience and to distinct components of anger. We also identify relationships between anger components, brain networks, and other affective research relevant to motivational states of dominance and basic needs for safety.",Gabriela Gan;Gadi Gilam;Jessica Bezek;Antonio Bruno;Thomas F Denson;Talma Hendler;Leroy Lowe;Veronica Mariotti;Maria R Muscatello;Sara Palumbo;Silvia Pellegrini;Pietro Pietrini;Amelia Rizzo;Edelyn Verona
18,Małgorzata Łupina,"Linagliptin is a selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor which suppresses the rapid degradation of endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). In clinical practice, it is used as an antidiabetic drug, but recent studies have confirmed its role in the activity of the central nervous system (CNS). The reported study focused on the role of linagliptin (10 and 20 mg/kg, ip) in the morphine rewarding effect, analyzing how the agent had influenced the conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats via the expression, acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of the morphine rewarding effect. The obtained results clearly demonstrated linagliptin to inhibit the expression and acquisition, to accelerate the extinction and, eventually, to reduce the reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP. The undertaken experiments significantly extended our knowledge on the mechanisms behind the morphine rewarding effect.",Sylwia Talarek;Jolanta Kotlińska;Ewa Gibuła-Tarłowska;Piotr Listos;Joanna Listos
19,Sandra Dörrenbächer,"Cognitive control is supported by a dynamic interplay of transient brain activation across fronto-parietal networks and sustained activation across fronto-striatal networks. Older adults show disturbances in this dynamic functional recruitment. There is evidence suggesting that cognitive-control training may enable older adults to redistribute their brain activation across cortical and subcortical networks, which in turn can limit behavioral impairments. However, previous studies have only focused on spatial rather than on temporal aspects of changes in brain activation. In the present study, we examined training-related functional plasticity in old age by applying a hybrid fMRI design that sensitively tracks the spatio-temporal interactions underlying brain-activation changes. Fifty healthy seniors were assigned to a task-shifting training or an active-control group and their pretest/posttest activation-change maps were compared against 25 untrained younger adults. After training, older adults showed the same performance as untrained young adults. Compared to the control group, task-shifting training promoted proactive changes in transient mechanisms supporting the maintenance and biasing of task-set representations in a specific prefrontal circuitry; reactive changes in transient mechanisms supporting response-selection processes in dissociable fronto-parietal networks; overall reductions of sustained activation in striatal circuits. Results highlight the importance of spatio-temporal interactions in training-induced neural changes in age.",Carolyn Wu;Hubert Zimmer;Jutta Kray
20,Brecht Polspoel,"Only a small amount of studies have looked at the structural neural correlates of children's arithmetic. Furthermore, these studies mainly implemented voxel-based morphometry, which only takes the volume of regions into account, without looking at other structural properties. The current study aimed to contribute knowledge on which brain regions are important for children's arithmetic on a structural level, by not only implementing voxel-based morphometry, but also cortical complexity analyses, based on the fractal dimension index. This complexity measure describes a characteristic of surface shape. Data of 43 typically developing 9-10 year-olds were analyzed. All children were asked to take part in two test sessions: behavioral data collection and MRI data acquisition. For data analysis, mean values for volume and cortical complexity were estimated within regions of interest (ROIs) and extracted for further analysis. The selected ROIs were based on regions found to be related to children's mathematical abilities in previous research. Results point towards associations between arithmetic fluency and the volume of the right fusiform gyrus, as well as the cortical complexity of the left postcentral gyrus, right insular sulcus, and left lateral orbital sulcus. Remarkably, no significant associations were observed between the children's arithmetic fluency and the volume or cortical complexity of typically arithmetic-associated parietal regions, such as the superior parietal lobe, intraparietal sulcus, or angular gyrus. Accordingly, the current study highlights the importance of structural characteristics of brain regions other than these typically arithmetic-associated parietal regions for children's arithmetic fluency.",Maaike Vandermosten;Bert De Smedt
21,Benedito Jamilson Araújo Pereira,"PURPOSE
To evaluate the relationship between meningioma histological subtype and tumor site in under-20 year-olds.


METHODS
A review of the literature on meningioma during the first 2 decades of life was carried out through a Medline search up to February 2019. To evaluate the adult population, a cross-sectional study was conducted on patients operated on between 2000 and 2014 in a single institution. Exclusion criteria comprised: series reports and papers that lacked detailed description of clinical findings, neuroimaging confirmation of tumor location, and/or at least 5 years' follow-up.


RESULTS
107 manuscripts were included, for 365 under-20 year-old patients: 200 male, and 164 female. Histopathology found 197 cases (53.9%) of WHO grade I meningioma, with predominance of meningothelial (41.1%) and transitional (30.9%) subtypes; 123 (33.7%) grade II, and 45 (12.3%) grade III. For 65 (18.25%) of the 356 cases, recurrence was documented, with only 24 deaths (6.7%).


CONCLUSION
Meningioma in this population presented 2 differences compared to the adult population: male predominance, and high incidence of atypical meningioma. Surgery was the primary treatment.

22,Zhichun Chen,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a 200 year-long research history. Our understanding about its clinical phenotype and pathogenesis remains limited, although dopaminergic replacement therapy has significantly improved patient outcomes. Autonomic dysfunction is an essential category of non-motor phenotypes that has recently become a cutting edge field that directs frontier research in PD. In this review, we initially describe the epidemiology of dysautonomic symptoms in PD. Then, we perform a meticulous analysis of the pathophysiology of autonomic dysfunction in PD and propose that the peripheral autonomic nervous system may be a key route for α-synuclein pathology propagation from the periphery to the central nervous system. In addition, we recommend that constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and pure autonomic failure should be viewed as prodromal dysautonomic markers in PD prediction and diagnosis. Finally, we summarize the strategies currently available for the treatment of autonomic dysfunction in PD and suggest that high-quality, better-designed, randomized clinical trials should be conducted in the future.",Guanglu Li;Jun Liu
23,Nanae Fukushima,"Crush injury to peripheral nerves in adult animals is considered not to trigger retrograde neuronal cell death; however, several studies reported neuronal cell death following severe injuries including nerve transection, resection, or avulsion. However, the rate of neuronal cell death varied among studies. In this study, we evaluated the outcomes of very severe nerve injury by long nerve resection in adult rats. Right hypoglossal (XII) nerve was exposed, and a 9-mm section was resected. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the resection, the number of XII neurons were counted in from the rostral to caudal sections. The number of XII neurons in the injured right side was reduced after the XII nerve resection compared with the uninjured left side. The mean rates of surviving neurons at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the nerve resection were 83.5 %, 73.9 %, and 61.1 %, respectively, which were significantly lower than those of the control. The number of XII neurons after extensive XII nerve resection declined gradually over a relatively long time period, revealing that extensive nerve resection led to slow cell death of the injured neurons.",Tatsuya Kobayashi;Akira Kakegawa;Norimi Sumitomo;Ayata Nagira;Tetsuji Moriizumi
24,Yan-Hai Li,"Medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons are involved in the regulation of eye movements to endure the stability of the image during head movement, and play a critical role in plasticity of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) during the juvenile period. We have previously shown that the long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission was induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS) and blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-APV at the vestibular afferent synapses of type-B MVN neurons. In the present study, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vitro to investigate the subunit composition of these NMDA receptors in the induction of LTD in MVN slices from postnatal 13-16 day rats. We found that LTD induced in type-B neurons of the rat MVN with HFS was blocked by Ro 25-6981, a specific antagonist for GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. Moreover, the other selective GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor antagonist (ifenprodil) also prevented the induction of LTD. However, bath application of the GluN2A-containing NMDA receptor antagonists (Zn2+ and TCN 201) had no influence on the induction of LTD. Similar results were obtained by exogenously applied two GluN2C/GluN2D-preferring NMDA receptor antagonists (PPDA and UBP 141). Furthermore, presynaptic NMDA receptor subunits are not necessary for vestibular LTD. These results suggest that the induction of LTD by HFS in vestibular afferent synapses of type-B MVN neurons requires postsynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors, but not GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors or GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors.",Youjun Li;Liang Zheng;Jue Wang
25,Rafael Pazinatto Aguiar,"Pharmacological interventions that selectively activate serotonin 5-hydroxytryptramine-1A (5-HT1A) heteroreceptors may prevent or attenuate the consequences of brain ischemic episodes. The present study investigated whether the preferential 5-HT1A postsynaptic receptor agonist NLX-101 (a.k.a. F15599) mitigates cognitive and emotional impairments and affects neuroplasticity in mice that are subjected to the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) model of brain ischemia. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram (Esc) was used for comparative purposes because it is able to decrease morbidity and improve recovery in stroke patients and ischemic rodents. Sham and BCCAO mice received daily doses of NLX-101 (0.32 mg/kg, i.p) or Esc (20 mg/kg, i.p) for 28 days. During this period, they were evaluated for locomotor activity, anxiety- and despair-related behaviors and hippocampus-dependent cognitive function, using the open field, elevated zero maze, forced swim test and object location test, respectivelly. The mice's brains were processed for biochemical and histological analyses. BCCAO mice exhibited high anxiety and despair-like behaviors and performed worse than controls in the cognitive assessment. BCCAO induced neuronal and dendritic spine loss and decreases in the protein levels of neuronal plasticity markers, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptophysin (SYN), and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. NLX-101 and Esc attenuated cognitive impairments and despair-like behaviors in BCCAO mice. Only Esc decreased anxiety-like behaviors due to brain ischemia. Both NLX-101 and Esc blocked the increase in plasma corticosterone levels and, restored BDNF, SYN and PSD-95 protein levels in the hippocampus. Moreover, both compounds impacted positively dentritic remodeling in the hippocampus and PFC of ischemic mice. In the PFC, NLX-101 increased the BDNF protein levels, while Esc in turn, attenuated the decrease in the PSD-95 protein levels induced by BCCAO. The present results suggest that activation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors is the molecular mechanism for serotonergic protective effects in BCCAO. Moreover, post-synaptic biased agonists such as NLX-101 might constitute promising therapeutics for treatment of functional and neurodegenerative outcomes of brain ischemia.",Lígia Mendes Soares;Erika Meyer;Fernanda Canova da Silveira;Humberto Milani;Adrian Newman-Tancredi;Mark Varney;Jos Prickaerts;Rúbia M Weffort de Oliveira
26,Manon Meyrel,"Increasing evidence suggest a bidirectional link between disrupted circadian rhythms and alcohol use disorders (AUD). A better understanding of these alcohol-induced changes in circadian rhythms will likely provide important therapeutic solutions. We conducted a systematic review based on the PubMed database examining biological rhythms in all stages of alcohol use: acute alcohol consumption, AUD, alcohol withdrawal, and abstinence. Different changes in circadian rhythms have been observed after a single acute alcohol intake, but also during AUD and alcohol withdrawal. Following a single acute alcohol intake, changes in biological rhythms are dose-dependent, reflected in the melatonin and cortisol secretions, and the core body temperature (CBT) rhythms. These alterations normalize the next morning and appear mostly for acute alcohol intake higher than 0.5 g/kg. These alterations are more severe during AUD and persist over time. In addition, interestingly, opposite patterns of the melatonin physiological ratio between diurnal and nocturnal secretion (N/D ratio < 1) have been observed during AUD and appear to be a marker of chronic daily use. During alcohol withdrawal, circadian rhythms desynchronization correlates with the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and withdrawal complications such as delirium tremens. During abstinence a resynchronization of circadian rhythms of cortisol and CBT appears in most patients about 1 month after alcohol withdrawal. Disruption of melatonin circadian rhythms can persist after 3-12 weeks of abstinence. The circadian genetic vulnerability associated with biological rhythms alterations in alcohol use disorders increases the risk of relapses. Circadian-based interventions could play a critical role in preventing and treating AUD.",Benjamin Rolland;Pierre A Geoffroy
27,Norbert Kopco,"Auditory distance perception and its neuronal mechanisms are poorly understood, mainly because 1) it is difficult to separate distance processing from intensity processing, 2) multiple intensity-independent distance cues are often available, and 3) the cues are combined in a context-dependent way. A recent fMRI study identified human auditory cortical area representing intensity-independent distance for sources presented along the interaural axis (Kopco et al. PNAS, 109, 11019-11024). For these sources, two intensity-independent cues are available, interaural level difference (ILD) and direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR). Thus, the observed activations may have been contributed by not only distance-related, but also direction-encoding neuron populations sensitive to ILD. Here, the paradigm from the previous study was used to examine DRR-based distance representation for sounds originating in front of the listener, where ILD is not available. In a virtual environment, we performed behavioral and fMRI experiments, combined with computational analyses to identify the neural representation of distance based on DRR. The stimuli varied in distance (15-100 cm) while their received intensity was varied randomly and independently of distance. Behavioral performance showed that intensity-independent distance discrimination is accurate for frontal stimuli, even though it is worse than for lateral stimuli. fMRI activations for sounds varying in frontal distance, as compared to varying only in intensity, increased bilaterally in the posterior banks of Heschl's gyri, the planum temporale, and posterior superior temporal gyrus regions. Taken together, these results suggest that posterior human auditory cortex areas contain neuron populations that are sensitive to distance independent of intensity and of binaural cues relevant for directional hearing.",Keerthi Kumar Doreswamy;Samantha Huang;Stephanie Rossi;Jyrki Ahveninen
28,Christina Hofmann-Shen,"Various studies have suggested that auditory deviance detection is organized in a hierarchical manner with ascending levels of complexity. Event-related potentials (ERP) are considered to reflect different cortical processing stages. In the current electroencephalographic study, we employed an auditory sequence oddball paradigm to investigate different levels of cortical auditory processing and the contribution of neuronal habituation and prediction error mechanism to N1 and Mismatch Negativity (MMN). Our findings suggest that N1 reflects a lower cortical process primarily involved in the encoding of simple physical features and is thus mainly modulated by neuronal attenuation and not complex top-down mechanisms. By analyzing within-sequence signal differences, we divided the MMN into distinct subcomponents reflecting different hierachical levels of auditory processing. We determined a ""first-order"" MMN that reflects the processing of simple deviant features (such as frequency) and ""higher-order"" MMNs that occur at regularity violation of complex patterns or unexpected inputs that do not allow further predictions. In our source localization analysis, both the primary auditory cortex and left IFG were primarily involved in the detection of simple, physically deviant features, while the right IFG was associated with the processing of novel, unexpected auditory inputs and the ACC with regularity violation of known patterns. Summarizing, our results might contribute to a better understanding of the different complexities of neuronal habituation and prediction error mechanisms at different levels of cortical auditory processing.",Bob O Vogel;Maximillian Kaffes;Armin Rudolph;Elliot C Brown;Cumhur Tas;Martin Brüne;Andres H Neuhaus
29,Walker S Pedersen,"The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are hypothesized to be the output nodes of the extended amygdala threat response, integrating multiple signals to coordinate the threat response via outputs to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The BNST and CeA are structurally and functionally connected, suggesting interactions between these regions may regulate how the response to provocation unfolds. However, the relationship between human BNST-CeA connectivity and the behavioral response to affective stimuli is little understood. To investigate whether individual differences in BNST-CeA connectivity are related to the affective response to negatively valenced stimuli, we tested relations between resting-state BNST-CeA connectivity and both facial electromyographic (EMG) activity of the corrugator supercilii muscle and eyeblink startle magnitude during affective image presentation within the Refresher sample of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. We found that higher right BNST-CeA connectivity was associated with greater corrugator activity to negative, but not positive, images. There was a trend-level association between right BNST-CeA connectivity and trait negative affect. Eyeblink startle magnitude was not significantly related to BNST-CeA connectivity. These results suggest that functional interactions between BNST and CeA contribute to the behavioral response to negative emotional events.",Stacey M Schaefer;Lauren K Gresham;Seungbeum D Lee;Michael P Kelly;Jeanette A Mumford;Jonathan A Oler;Richard J Davidson

Our purpose was to examine how stress affects functional connectivity (FC) in language processing regions of the brain during a verbal problem solving task associated with creativity. We additionally explored how gender and the presence of the stress-susceptible short allele of the serotonin transporter gene polymorphism influenced this effect.


METHODS
Forty-five healthy participants (Mean age: 19.6 ​± ​1.6 years; 28 females) were recruited to be a part of this study and genotyped to determine the presence or absence of at least one copy of the short (S) allele of the serotonin transporter gene, which is associated with greater susceptibility to stress. The participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging in two separate sessions (stress and no stress control). One session utilized a modified version of the Montreal Imaging Stress Test (MIST) to induce stress while the other session consisted of a no stress control task. The MIST and control tasks were interleaved with task blocks during which the participants performed the compound remote associates task, a convergent task that engages divergent thinking, which is a critical component of creativity. We examined the relationship between stress effects on performance and effects on connectivity of language processing regions activated during this task.


RESULTS
There was no main effect of stress on functional connectivity for individual ROI pairs. However, in the examination of whether stress effects on performance related to effects on connectivity, changes in middle temporal gyrus connectivity with stress correlated positively with changes in solution latency for individuals with the S allele, but anti-correlated for those with only the L allele. A trend towards a gene ​× ​stress interaction on solution latency was also observed.


DISCUSSION
Results from the study suggest that genetic susceptibility to stress, such as the presence of the S allele, affects neural correlates of performance on tasks related to verbal problem solving, as indicated by connectivity of the middle temporal gyrus. Future work will need to determine whether connectivity of the middle temporal gyrus serves as a marker for the effect of stress susceptibility on cognition, extending into stress susceptible patient populations.",John P Hegarty;Bradley J Ferguson;Patrick M Hecht;Michael Tilley;Shawn E Christ;David Q Beversdorf
31,Taro Yanagawa,"OBJECTIVE
Opening of mastoid air cells (MACs), a complication of lateral suboccipital craniotomy for microvascular decompression (MVD), might cause cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and meningitis. Only a few studies have investigated the association of degree of MAC development and actual opening of MACs. The present study focused on preoperative risk assessment for predicting the opening of MACs.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
The study included 204 consecutive patients who underwent MVD at our hospital between January 2014 and December 2018. We retrospectively collected clinical and neuroimaging data from electronic medical charts and discharge summaries. MACs were classified into four types according to neuroimaging data. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) was used to assess patients with and without CSF leakage into MACs.


RESULTS
No CSF leakage was observed into types 1 and 2 MACs, but it was noted in 14 of 46 patients (30 %) with type 3 and 44 of 58 patients (76 %) with type 4 MACs. Opening of MACs during surgery could not be recognized in 33 (57 %). CSF rhinorrhea was noted in 1 of the 58 patients with CSF leakage into MACs and meningitis was not noted.


CONCLUSION
Patients with types 3 and 4 MACs have a high risk of CSF leakage. Complete prevention of mild symptoms, such as ear obstruction, is challenging even if opened MACs are sealed, but serious complications, such as CSF rhinorrhea and meningitis, can be avoided. For cases in which preoperative CT reveals a high risk of opening of MACs, preventive closure should be performed.",Toru Hatayama;Yoichi Harada;Eishi Sato;Keiichi Yamashita;Masaki Tanaka;Masataka Torii;Masaru Kiyomoto;Hiroya Imai;Takuro Ehara;Takuji Kono
32,Ruiqi Chen,"OBJECTIVE
Seizures are common complications following intracranial aneurysms and present a greater risk to pediatric patients than adults. Though the risk factors of seizures in adults with intracranial aneurysms have been well documented, the risk factors in pediatric patients remain unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for preoperative seizures and the effect of the treatment approach on postoperative seizures in pediatric patients with intracranial aneurysms.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
The data of 64 pediatric patients (mean age 11.4 ± 5.7 years; 68.8 % of males) with intracranial aneurysms were retrospectively analyzed from January 2012 to April 2017. Comparisons were made between patients with preoperative seizures (case group) and those without (control group).


RESULTS
Twenty-four patients (37.5 %) had preoperative seizures, and 15 patients (23.4 %) had postoperative seizures. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age (0-5 years), head trauma history, ruptured aneurysms, lobe hematomas, modified Fisher grade 3-4, giant aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and distal arterial aneurysms were independently associated with the increased risk of preoperative seizures. Patients in the surgical and endovascular groups did not differ significantly in the rates of preoperative seizures or early postoperative seizures (within 1 month) (P > 0.05). However, a significantly lower incidence of late postoperative seizures (1-3 months and 3-6 months) was observed in the surgical group compared with the endovascular group (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
Pediatric patients with intracranial aneurysms are at high risk for seizures. Risk factors for preoperative seizures included younger age (0-5 years), head trauma history, lobe hematomas, modified Fisher grade 3-4, giant aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and distal arterial aneurysms. Compared with the endovascular treatment, surgical intervention provided more benefits with regard to reducing the risk of late postoperative seizures.",Xin Zan;Anqi Xiao;Rui Guo;Lu Xing;Lu Ma;Chao You;Yi Liu
33,Ping-Yeh Chiu,"BACKGROUND
Various surgical techniques for treating spondylodiskitis have been proposed, but the most appropriate surgical treatment remains controversial. In this study, we propose a new hybrid approach combining the use of cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screws and pedicle screws with the technique of transforaminal lumbar interbody debridement and fusion (TLIDF). With this method, we can shorten the length of the segment that needs to be fixed, minimize the extent of surgical dissection, and reduce the risk of adjacent level degeneration.


METHODS
Patients with clinical and radiographic evidences of single-level lumbar spondylodiskitis seen between January and December of 2017 were included in the study. Demographic data, including age and gender, were recorded. The intra-operative details, results of culture, functional outcome, radiologic outcome, and length of hospital stay were recorded.


RESULTS
The mean age of 15 patients was 62.8 years old. The mean operative time was 135 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 260 ml. The culture rate was 80%. The mean Numeric Rating Scale score and Oswestry Disability Index score significantly improved from 6.60 to 2.47 and from 21.20 to 10.20, respectively. No major perioperative complications occurred.


CONCLUSIONS
With the proposed hybrid approach using CBT and pedicle screws with the TLIDF technique, the damaged anterior column can be debrided and reconstructed, and spinal stabilization can also be achieved.",Jia-En Chi;Fu-Cheng Kao;Ming-Kei Hsieh;Tsung-Ting Tsai
34,Telvinderjit Singh,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT
Information on the 3D shape of vertebral endplates is lacking. Prior studies have analysed 2D shape, however 3D data is important as it may help improve our understanding of how differences in shape are related to age, gender, race, size and other parameters which may subsequently help improve device design for interbody prosthesis.


PURPOSE
To study the 3D shape of lumbar vertebral endplates from normal adult lumbar spines and correlate them with age, gender, spinal/endplate level, endplate surface area, concave depth, and size.


STUDY DESIGN
In-vivo analysis of lumbar vertebral endplate 3D shape.


MATERIALS & METHODS
136 patients' CT scans were used to create 3D models of the lumbar spine for each patient which were subsequently analysed.


RESULTS
The shape of the superior endplates are different when compared to inferior endplates. Across the lumbar spine (L1-S1) the shape of inferior endplates are very similar to one another, however the shape of the superior endplate varies between spinal levels significantly. There was no clear relationship between age and Principal Component (PC) shapes but there was a strong correlation between endplate concave depth and endplate PC shape scores.


CONCLUSION
Future interbody (disc replacement and fusion) device designs could utilise the findings that inferior endplate shape is similar throughout the length of the lumbar spine, whereas superior endplate shape changes. Further, future implants could be level-specific as the present study shows that the endplate shape varies through the length of the lumbar spine.",William Parr;Wen Jie Choy;Gideon Richard Budiono;Monish Maharaj;Xavier Mathis;Kevin Phan;William Robert Walsh;Ralph Jasper Mobbs

36,Anthony M Tonsbeek,"OBJECTIVE
Aberrant vertebral artery loops are a rare clinical condition, with sparse data regarding the optimal treatment guidelines for individual patients. The heterogeneity of treatment options in the current literature creates a problem when tailoring treatments to individual patients. In this review of the literature, multiple surgical treatments for cervical vertebral artery loops were analysed and compared. In addition, this article provides a clinical case of a patient with a vertebral artery loop.


METHODS
A literature review was conducted to identify studies investigating surgical treatments for a vertebral artery loop. Different surgical techniques were examined and the involved techniques and approaches described. The outcomes were assessed for each study and the effectiveness of the treatment determined.


RESULTS
Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Six types of surgical interventions were found in the literature. Each intervention had similar postoperative results, leading to either a significant improvement or a complete resolution of symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Multiple successful surgical interventions have been described in the medical literature. However, due to the lack of evidence-based studies, no surgical intervention protocol could be determined. Treatment should therefore be tailored to individual patient's characteristics. Since not every radiologically detected VA loop is the main culprit for a patient's complaints, a thorough multidisciplinary approach is justified and advocated in patients with an atypical presentation, before a neurosurgical intervention takes place. More deliberate clinical decisions can be made once the understanding of the pathogenesis of this rare disease entity has been established and treatment protocols formulated.",Justus L Groen;Carmen L A M Vleggeert-Lankamp

41,Sho Kojima,"We evaluated the effects of moderate-intensity exercise in improving the decline in cognitive performance induced by a 24-h period of acute sleep deprivation (SD). We hypothesized that the positive effect of exercise is mediated by increased oxygenation (measured using near-infrared spectroscopy) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Cognitive performance was measured using the reaction time and interference scores of the Stroop colour and word test, in 12 healthy adults (eight males, 21.1 ± 0.3 years-old), at pre- and post-exercise. Cognitive scores were compared under two conditions: rested wakefulness (RW) and 24-h SD. The exercise consisted of 20-min of ergometer cycling at an intensity of 60 % VO2peak. Oxygenation to the DLPFC increased, at 12 min after exercise onset, compared to the baseline and was maintained until the end of the exercise in both RW and SD conditions (P < 0.01). The change in RT correlated with sleepiness (P < 0.05), with no correlation for the interference score and oxygenation. Taken together, moderate-intensity exercise reverses SD-induced cognitive decline.",Tomoya Abe;Shinichiro Morishita;Yuta Inagaki;Weixiang Qin;Kazuki Hotta;Atsuhiro Tsubaki

To assay EEG signal quality recorded with tripolar concentric ring electrodes (TCREs) compared to regular EEG electrodes.


METHODS
EEG segments were recorded simultaneously by TCREs and regular electrodes, low-pass filtered at 35 Hz (REG35) and 70 Hz (REG70). Clips were rated blindly by nine electroencephalographers for presence or absence of key EEG features, relative to the ""gold-standard"" of the clinical report.


RESULTS
TCRE showed less EMG artifact (F = 15.4, p < 0.0001). Overall quality rankings were not significantly different. Focal slowing was better detected by TCRE and spikes were better detected by regular electrodes. Seizures (n = 85) were detected by TCRE in 64 cases (75.3%), by REG70 in 75 (88.2%) and REG35 in 69 (81.2%) electrodes. TCRE detected 9 (10.6%) seizures not detected by one of the other 2 methods. In contrast, 14 seizures (16.5%) were not detected by TCRE, but were by REG35 electrodes. Each electrode detected interictal spikes when the other did not.


CONCLUSIONS
TCRE produced similar overall quality and confidence ratings versus regular electrodes, but less muscle artifact. TCRE recordings detected seizures in 7% of instances where regular electrodes did not.

43,Adomas Bunevicius,"MR elastography allows non-invasive quantification of the shear modulus of tissue, i.e. tissue stiffness and viscosity, information that offers the potential to guide presurgical planning for brain tumor resection. Here, we review brain tumor MRE studies with particular attention to clinical applications. Studies that investigated MRE in patients with intracranial tumors, both malignant and benign as well as primary and metastatic, were queried from the Pubmed/Medline database in August 2018. Reported tumor and normal appearing white matter stiffness values were extracted and compared as a function of tumor histopathological diagnosis and MRE vibration frequencies. Because different studies used different elastography hardware, pulse sequences, reconstruction inversion algorithms, and different symmetry assumptions about the mechanical properties of tissue, effort was directed to ensure that similar quantities were used when making inter-study comparisons. In addition, because different methodologies and processing pipelines will necessarily bias the results, when pooling data from different studies, whenever possible, tumor values were compared with the same subject's contralateral normal appearing white matter to minimize any study-dependent bias. The literature search yielded 10 studies with a total of 184 primary and metastatic brain tumor patients. The group mean tumor stiffness, as measured with MRE, correlated with intra-operatively assessed stiffness of meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Pooled data analysis showed significant overlap between shear modulus values across brain tumor types. When adjusting for the same patient normal appearing white matter shear modulus values, meningiomas were the stiffest tumor-type. MRE is increasingly being examined for potential in brain tumor imaging and might have value for surgical planning. However, significant overlap of shear modulus values between a number of different tumor types limits applicability of MRE for diagnostic purposes. Thus, further rigorous studies are needed to determine specific clinical applications of MRE for surgical planning, disease monitoring and molecular stratification of brain tumors.",Katharina Schregel;Ralph Sinkus;Alexandra Golby;Samuel Patz

45,Ouyang Chen,"Inflammation is the body's protective reaction to injury and infection. Pain is a hallmark of inflammation and can be either protective or detrimental during acute or chronic phase. Macrophages play a chief role in the pathogenesis of pain and have bilateral communications with nociceptors, the specialized primary sensory neurons that sense pain. Macrophages 'talk to' nociceptors by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines) that induce pain via direct activation of nociceptors. Macrophages also 'listen to' nociceptors, by which nociceptors secrete neuropeptides and chemokines which act on macrophages. Activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in nociceptors releases CCL2, activating macrophages and potentiating pathological pain. Emerging evidence also points to a pro-resolution role of macrophages in inflammation and pain. Macrophage GPR37 is activated by neuroprotectin D1, a specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) and resolves inflammatory pain via phagocytosis and production of IL-10 that inhibits nociceptors. Macrophage-nociceptor interactions are also mediated by microRNAs and microRNA-containing exosomes in chronic pain. Notably, extracellular microRNAs (e.g. let-7b and miR-711) can directly bind and activate nociceptors. Targeting macrophage-nociceptor interactions will help to control inflammation and pain.",Christopher R Donnelly;Ru-Rong Ji

In contrast to most vertebrates, insects usually must cope with low resolution retinal images and the inability to infer spatial features using accommodation or stereovision.

Second, I suggest that a basic understanding of number, what numerical quantity means, is innately wired into the brain and gives rise to an intuitive number sense, or number instinct. Third and finally, I argue that symbolic counting and arithmetic in humans is rooted in an evolutionarily and ontogenetically primeval neural system for non-symbolic number representations.

Disproportionately Enlarged Subarachnoid space Hydrocephalus (DESH) is considered as an important imaging feature of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).


METHOD
Subjects aged 60 and over in a memory clinic and a community-based cohort were assessed for the presence of ventriculomegaly, Sylvian dilatation, and high convexity tightness by neuroimaging, and a clinical triad of iNPH symptoms, i.e. cognitive, gait and urinary symptoms.


RESULTS
In the memory clinic-based study (548 subjects), the prevalence of DESH was 1.1% and increased with age. The clinical triad was significantly more frequent in subjects with DESH (50%) compared to those with normal images (none), Sylvian dilatation (7%), and ventriculomegaly (12%). Gait disturbance was also significantly more frequent in DESH (83%) compared to those with normal images (2%), Sylvian dilatation (14%), and ventriculomegaly (26%). In the community-based cohort (946 subjects), the prevalence of DESH was 1.0% and increased with age. The clinical triad (11%) was significantly more common in subjects with DESH compared to those with normal images (none), Sylvian dilatation (2%), and ventriculomegaly (7%). Gait disturbance was also significantly more common in DESH (33%) compared to those with normal images (1%), Sylvian dilatation (4%), and ventriculomegaly (10%).

The reported prevalence of DESH was approximately 1%, and increased with age. DESH and high convexity tightness were specifically associated with the clinical triad of iNPH.

52,David Smailes,"Introduction: It has been proposed that hallucinations occur because of problems with reality discrimination (when internal, self-generated cognitions are misattributed to an external, non-self source) and because of elevated levels of top-down processing. In this study, we examined whether visual reality discrimination abilities and elevated top-down processing (assessed via face pareidolia-proneness) were associated with how often non-clinical participants report visual hallucination-like experiences.Methods: Participants (N = 82, mean age = 23.12 years) completed a visual reality discrimination task and a face pareidolia task, as well as self-report measures of schizotypy and of the frequency of visual hallucination-like experiences.Results: Regression analysis demonstrated that the number of false alarms made on the visual reality discrimination task and the number of hits made on the face pareidolia task were independent predictors of the frequency of visual hallucination-like experiences. Correlations between performance on the tasks and levels of schizotypy were not statistically significant.Conclusions: These findings suggest that weaker visual reality discrimination abilities and elevated levels of top-down processing are associated with visual hallucination-proneness and are discussed in terms of the idea that clinical visual hallucinations and non-clinical visual hallucination-like experiences share similar cognitive mechanisms.",Emma Burdis;Constantina Gregoriou;Bryony Fenton;Rob Dudley
53,Mary H Burleson,"John Cacioppo and colleagues' Somatovisceral Afference Model of Emotion (SAME) highlighted the importance of interoception in emotional experience. Here we compare how the SAME and the more recent Theory of Constructed Emotion (TCE) view the role of interoceptive signals in creating emotional experiences. We describe the characteristics of touch sensations that are carried by thin, unmyelinated fibers called C-tactile afferents (CTs) to the posterior insula, and are thus deemed interoceptive despite their typically social (external) origin. We explore how this social interoceptive input might contribute to the emotion-related effects of social touch more generally, and speculate that all social touch, with or without CT afferent stimulation, can directly influence allostasis, or the predictive regulation of short- and long-term energy resources required by the body. Finally, we describe several features of CT-optimal touch that make it a potentially useful tool to help illuminate basic interoceptive mechanisms, emotion-related phenomena, and disorders involving atypical affect or somatosensation. These proposed ideas demonstrate the long intellectual reach of John Cacioppo and Gary Berntson's highly productive scientific collaboration, which was formative for the fields of social neuroscience, social psychophysiology, and affective neuroscience.",Karen S Quigley

Endovascular treatment (EVT) is now considered the gold standard for select patient populations with anterior circulation stroke; however, data on the treatment of posterior circulation stroke are less clear. This study aims to determine the characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EVT for patients with acute BAO in a high-volume stroke center.


METHODS
This study included 187 consecutive patients with acute BAO who underwent EVT from January 2012 to July 2018 in the Beijing Tiantan Hospital. The baseline characteristics, procedure parameters, and functional outcome were assessed.


RESULTS
Among the 187 patients, 138 (73.8%) underwent mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever, 33 (17.6%) underwent direct intracranial angioplasty (balloon dilation and/or stent implantation) for underlying severe intracranial atherosclerotic disease, and 91 (48.7%) underwent combined mechanical thrombectomy and angioplasty. Successful recanalization [modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade 2b-3] was achieved in 158 patients (84.5%). Overall, the rates of functional independence [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2] and favorable outcome (mRS 0-3) at 90 days were 36.4 and 49.2%, respectively, and 90-day all-cause mortality was 20.3%.

EVT was effective and safe for treating patients with acute BAO.",Xu Tong;Feng Gao;Huiting Lao;Zhongrong Miao
55,Sebastian Proschinger,"BACKGROUND
The relevance of regular moderate to intense exercise for ameliorating psychomotor symptoms in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is becoming increasingly evident. Over the last two decades, emerging evidence from clinical studies and animal models indicate immune regulatory mechanisms in both periphery and the central nervous system that may underlie these beneficial effects. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier as the main structural interface between periphery and brain seems to play an important role in MS. Reducing the secretion of proteolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), i.e. MMP-2, as disruptors of blood-brain barrier integrity could have profound implications for MS.


METHODS
In this two-armed randomized controlled trial 64 participants with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (EDSS 0-4.0) will be allocated to either an intervention group or a passive wait list control group. The intervention group will perform 60 min of combined functional resistance and endurance exercises 3x per week over a period of 12 weeks in a community-based and publicly available setting. Changes in serum concentration of MMP-2 will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are numbers of immune cell subsets, soluble (anti-) inflammatory factors, physical capacity, cognitive performance, physical activity behavior, gait performance, and patient-reported outcomes. All outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after week 12 with an additional blood sampling before, during and immediately after a single training session in week 6.


DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT to investigate both the acute and chronic effects of a community-based intense functional resistance and endurance exercise regimen in persons with RRMS. Combining analysis of biological and cognitive or psychological outcomes may provide a better understanding of the MS-specific symptomology.

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide and characteristically accompanied by downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling emerges to attenuate neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke; however, its effect on modulating microglial polarization is largely unknown. Here, we explored whether Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator TWS119 facilitated long-term neurological recovery via modulating microglia polarization after experimental stroke.


METHODS
Ischemic stroke mice model was induced by permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion plus 1 h hypoxia. TWS119 was administrated from day 1 to 14 after stroke. Neurological deficits were monitored up to 21 days after stroke. Angiogenesis, neural plasticity, microglial polarization, and microglia-associated inflammatory cytokines were detected in the peri-infarct cortex at days 14 and 21 after stroke. Primary microglia and mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell lines were employed to explore the underlying mechanism in vitro.


RESULTS
TWS119 mitigated neurological deficits at days 14 and 21 after experimental stroke, paralleled by acceleration on angiogenesis and neural plasticity in the peri-infarct cortex. Mechanistically, cerebral ischemia induced production of microglia-associated proinflammatory cytokines and priming of activated microglia toward pro-inflammatory polarization, whereas TWS119 ameliorated microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory status following ischemic stroke and promoted angiogenesis by modulating microglia to anti-inflammatory phenotype. The beneficial efficacy of TWS119 in microglial polarization was largely reversed by selective Wnt/β-catenin pathway blockade in vitro, suggesting that TWS119-enabled pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory phenotype switch of microglia was possibly mediated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator TWS119 ameliorated neuroinflammatory microenvironment following chronic cerebral ischemia via modulating microglia towards anti-inflammatory phenotype, and facilitates neurological recovery in an anti-inflammatory phenotype polarization-dependent manner. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway following ischemic stroke might be a potential restorative strategy targeting microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.",Xiangjian Zhang;Junmin Chen;Xiaoxia Liu;Jing Xue;Lan Zhang;Xifa Lan
57,Paola Pontecorvi,"BACKGROUND
Astrocytes contribute to the crosstalk that generates chronic neuro-inflammation in neurological diseases; however, compared with microglia, astrocytes respond to a more limited continuum of innate immune system stimulants. Recent studies suggest that the fibrinolysis system may regulate inflammation. The goal of this study was to test whether fibrinolysis system components activate astrocytes and if so, elucidate the responsible biochemical pathway.


METHODS
Primary cultures of astrocytes and microglia were prepared from neonatal mouse brains. The ability of purified fibrinolysis system proteins to elicit a pro-inflammatory response was determined by measuring expression of the mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). IκBα phosphorylation also was measured. Plasminogen activation in association with cells was detected by chromogenic substrate hydrolysis. The activity of specific receptors was tested using neutralizing antibodies and reagents.


RESULTS
Astrocytes expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines when treated with plasminogen but not when treated with agonists for Toll-like Receptor-4 (TLR4), TLR2, or TLR9. Microglia also expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to plasminogen; however, in these cells, the response was observed only when tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) was added to activate plasminogen. In astrocytes, endogenously produced urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) converted plasminogen into plasmin in the absence of tPA. Plasminogen activation was dependent on the plasminogen receptor, α-enolase, and the uPA receptor, uPAR. Although uPAR is capable of directly activating cell-signaling, the receptor responsible for cytokine expression and IκBα phosphorylation response to plasmin was Protease-activated Receptor-1 (PAR-1). The pathway, by which plasminogen induced astrocyte activation, was blocked by inhibiting any one of the three receptors implicated in this pathway with reagents such as εACA, α-enolase-specific antibody, uPAR-specific antibody, the uPA amino terminal fragment, or a pharmacologic PAR-1 inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
Plasminogen may activate astrocytes for pro-inflammatory cytokine expression through the concerted action of at least three distinct fibrinolysis protease receptors. The pathway is dependent on uPA to activate plasminogen, which is expressed endogenously by astrocytes in culture but also may be provided by other cells in the astrocytic cell microenvironment in the CNS.",Michael A Banki;Carlotta Zampieri;Cristina Zalfa;Pardis Azmoon;Maria Z Kounnas;Cinzia Marchese;Steven L Gonias;Elisabetta Mantuano
58,Roberta Magliozzi,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies of cortical pathology in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis have shown that a more severe clinical course and the presence of extended subpial grey matter lesions with significant neuronal/glial loss and microglial activation are associated with meningeal inflammation, including the presence of lymphoid-like structures in the subarachnoid space in a proportion of cases.


METHODS
To investigate the molecular consequences of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic molecules diffusing from the meninges into the underlying grey matter, we carried out gene expression profiling analysis of the motor cortex from 20 post-mortem multiple sclerosis brains with and without substantial meningeal inflammation and 10 non-neurological controls.


RESULTS
Gene expression profiling of grey matter lesions and normal appearing grey matter not only confirmed the substantial pathological cell changes, which were greatest in multiple sclerosis cases with increased meningeal inflammation, but also demonstrated the upregulation of multiple genes/pathways associated with the inflammatory response. In particular, genes involved in tumour necrosis factor (TNF) signalling were significantly deregulated in MS cases compared with controls. Increased meningeal inflammation was found to be associated with a shift in the balance of TNF signalling away from TNFR1/TNFR2 and NFkB-mediated anti-apoptotic pathways towards TNFR1- and RIPK3-mediated pro-apoptotic/pro-necroptotic signalling in the grey matter, which was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. TNFR1 was found expressed preferentially on neurons and oligodendrocytes in MS cortical grey matter, whereas TNFR2 was predominantly expressed by astrocytes and microglia.


CONCLUSIONS
We suggest that the inflammatory milieu generated in the subarachnoid space of the multiple sclerosis meninges by infiltrating immune cells leads to increased demyelinating and neurodegenerative pathology in the underlying grey matter due to changes in the balance of TNF signalling.",Owain William Howell;Pascal Durrenberger;Eleonora Aricò;Rachel James;Carolina Cruciani;Cheryl Reeves;Federico Roncaroli;Richard Nicholas;Richard Reynolds
59,Andro Montoya,"BACKGROUND
Neuroinflammation constitutes a pathogenic process leading to neurodegeneration in several disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) and sepsis. Despite microglial cells being the central players in neuroinflammation, astrocytes play a key regulatory role in this process. Our previous results indicated that pharmacologic-antagonism or genetic deficiency of dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3) attenuated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in two mouse models of PD. Here, we studied how DRD3-signalling affects the dynamic of activation of microglia and astrocyte in the context of systemic inflammation.


METHODS
Neuroinflammation was induced by intraperitoneal administration of LPS. The effect of genetic DRD3-deficiency or pharmacologic DRD3-antagonism in the functional phenotype of astrocytes and microglia was determined by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry at different time-points.


RESULTS
Our results show that DRD3 was expressed in astrocytes, but not in microglial cells. DRD3 deficiency resulted in unresponsiveness of astrocytes and in attenuated microglial activation upon systemic inflammation. Furthermore, similar alterations in the functional phenotypes of glial cells were observed by DRD3 antagonism and genetic deficiency of DRD3 upon LPS challenge. Mechanistic analyses show that DRD3 deficiency resulted in exacerbated expression of the anti-inflammatory protein Fizz1 in glial cells both in vitro and in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that DRD3 signalling regulates the dynamic of the acquisition of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory features by astrocytes and microglia, finally favouring microglial activation and promoting neuroinflammation.",Daniela Elgueta;Javier Campos;Ornella Chovar;Paulina Falcón;Soledad Matus;Iván Alfaro;María Rosa Bono;Rodrigo Pacheco
60,Grant S Shields,"Fueling the rapid growth in our understanding of how stress influences cognition, the number of studies examining the effects of stress on various cognitive processes has grown substantially over the last two decades. Despite this growth, few published guidelines exist for designing these studies, and divergent paradigm designs can diminish typical effects of stress or even reverse them. The goal of this review, therefore, is to survey necessary considerations (e.g., validating a stress induction), important considerations (e.g., specifying the timing of the stressor and cognitive task), and best practices (e.g., using Bayesian analyses) when designing a study that aims at least in part to examine the effects of acute stress on some cognitive process or function. These guidelines will also serve to help readers of these studies interpret what may otherwise be very confusing, anomalous results. Designing and interpreting studies with these considerations and practices in mind will help to move the field of stress and cognition forward by clarifying how, exactly, stress influences performance on a given cognitive task in a population of interest.",

Paroxysmal tonic upgaze (PTU), defined as an involuntary upward movement of the eyes, has been considered as a benign phenomenon but may also be associated with ataxia and developmental delay.


METHODS
We report eight children with PTU; six of them also exhibiting symptoms of ataxia and/or developmental delay. Treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibition was offered to children with persisting and/or severe forms.


RESULTS
Whole-exome sequencing and genome-wide array analysis (n = 7) did not reveal mutations in the three known genes associated with PTU (CACNA1A, GRID2, SEPSECS), whereas by MLPA a heterozygous deletion of exon 31 of the CACNA1A gene could be detected in one patient, her mother and two further family members. Further exome and array analysis showed no recurrent variants in potentially novel PTU-related genes in more than one patient. A de novo variant at a highly conserved position in the SIM1 gene was detected in one patient, for which a pathogenic effect could be speculated. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition was started in five children and proved at least partially effective in all of them.

To evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of adjunctive brivaracetam (BRV) in children with epilepsy.


METHODS
This was an interim analysis (cut-off March 15, 2017) of pooled data from two open-label, single-arm, multicentre trials. N01263 (NCT00422422) was a 3-week trial of BRV 0.8-4 mg/kg/day in patients (1 month-<16 years) with epilepsy. Patients who completed this trial could continue into a long-term follow-up trial (N01266, NCT01364597) which also directly enrolled patients (4-<17 years) with focal seizures. After dose-escalation, patients received BRV 1-5 mg/kg/day (maximum 200 mg/day) during long-term evaluation. Data are reported for patients aged 4 to <16 years with focal seizures.


RESULTS
The safety set comprised 149 patients: 34 from the initial trial (26 entered long-term trial) and 115 directly enrolled into the long-term trial. At the cut-off, 90 patients were receiving BRV (total exposure: 299.4 patient-years). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 140/149 (94.0%) patients, most commonly (≥20%) nasopharyngitis (24.8%), pharyngitis (22.1%), convulsion (21.5%), and pyrexia (20.1%). TEAEs considered drug-related by the investigator were reported by 56/149 (37.6%) patients, most commonly somnolence (6.0%). Two patients died; neither death was considered related to BRV. Mean changes from baseline in child behaviour rating scales were small; most patients remained in their baseline category.


CONCLUSION
In this pooled analysis of two open-label trials including long-term data, adjunctive BRV was generally well tolerated in children aged 4 to <16 years with focal seizures. These findings supported approval of BRV as a new therapy option for children aged ≥4 years with focal seizures.",Vincent Badalamenti;Teresa Gasalla;Sami Elmoufti;Jan-Peer Elshoff
63,Irene Rosas,"We analyzed the frequency of intermediate alleles (IAs) in the ATXN1, ATXN2, and HTT genes in several neurodegenerative diseases. The study included 1126 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 440 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and 610 patients with Parkinson's disease. In all cohorts, we genotyped ATXN1 and ATXN2 CAG repeats. In addition, in the FTD cohort, we determined the number of HTT CAG repeats. The frequency of HTT IAs was higher in patients with FTD (6.9%) versus controls (2.9%) and in the C9orf72 expansion noncarriers (7.2%) versus controls (2.9%), although the difference was nonsignificant after correction for multiple testing. Compared with controls, progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) groups showed a significantly higher frequency of HTT IAs (13.6% vs. 2.9% controls). For the ATXN2 gene, we observed an increase in IA frequency in AD cases (AD 4.1% vs. controls 1.8%) and in the behavioral FTD group (4.8% vs. 1.8%). For the ATXN1 gene, we found a significant increase of IAs in patients with PNFA (18.6%) versus controls (6.7%).

64,Katrina M Moore,"BACKGROUND
Frontotemporal dementia is a heterogenous neurodegenerative disorder, with about a third of cases being genetic. Most of this genetic component is accounted for by mutations in GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72. In this study, we aimed to complement previous phenotypic studies by doing an international study of age at symptom onset, age at death, and disease duration in individuals with mutations in GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72.


METHODS
In this international, retrospective cohort study, we collected data on age at symptom onset, age at death, and disease duration for patients with pathogenic mutations in the GRN and MAPT genes and pathological expansions in the C9orf72 gene through the Frontotemporal Dementia Prevention Initiative and from published papers. We used mixed effects models to explore differences in age at onset, age at death, and disease duration between genetic groups and individual mutations. We also assessed correlations between the age at onset and at death of each individual and the age at onset and at death of their parents and the mean age at onset and at death of their family members. Lastly, we used mixed effects models to investigate the extent to which variability in age at onset and at death could be accounted for by family membership and the specific mutation carried.


FINDINGS
Data were available from 3403 individuals from 1492 families: 1433 with C9orf72 expansions (755 families), 1179 with GRN mutations (483 families, 130 different mutations), and 791 with MAPT mutations (254 families, 67 different mutations). Mean age at symptom onset and at death was 49·5 years (SD 10·0; onset) and 58·5 years (11·3; death) in the MAPT group, 58·2 years (9·8; onset) and 65·3 years (10·9; death) in the C9orf72 group, and 61·3 years (8·8; onset) and 68·8 years (9·7; death) in the GRN group. Mean disease duration was 6·4 years (SD 4·9) in the C9orf72 group, 7·1 years (3·9) in the GRN group, and 9·3 years (6·4) in the MAPT group. Individual age at onset and at death was significantly correlated with both parental age at onset and at death and with mean family age at onset and at death in all three groups, with a stronger correlation observed in the MAPT group (r=0·45 between individual and parental age at onset, r=0·63 between individual and mean family age at onset, r=0·58 between individual and parental age at death, and r=0·69 between individual and mean family age at death) than in either the C9orf72 group (r=0·32 individual and parental age at onset, r=0·36 individual and mean family age at onset, r=0·38 individual and parental age at death, and r=0·40 individual and mean family age at death) or the GRN group (r=0·22 individual and parental age at onset, r=0·18 individual and mean family age at onset, r=0·22 individual and parental age at death, and r=0·32 individual and mean family age at death). Modelling showed that the variability in age at onset and at death in the MAPT group was explained partly by the specific mutation (48%, 95% CI 35-62, for age at onset; 61%, 47-73, for age at death), and even more by family membership (66%, 56-75, for age at onset; 74%, 65-82, for age at death). In the GRN group, only 2% (0-10) of the variability of age at onset and 9% (3-21) of that of age of death was explained by the specific mutation, whereas 14% (9-22) of the variability of age at onset and 20% (12-30) of that of age at death was explained by family membership. In the C9orf72 group, family membership explained 17% (11-26) of the variability of age at onset and 19% (12-29) of that of age at death.


INTERPRETATION
Our study showed that age at symptom onset and at death of people with genetic frontotemporal dementia is influenced by genetic group and, particularly for MAPT mutations, by the specific mutation carried and by family membership. Although estimation of age at onset will be an important factor in future pre-symptomatic therapeutic trials for all three genetic groups, our study suggests that data from other members of the family will be particularly helpful only for individuals with MAPT mutations. Further work in identifying both genetic and environmental factors that modify phenotype in all groups will be important to improve such estimates.

65,Yonil Jung,"Innate behaviors involve both reflexive motor programs and enduring internal states, but how these responses are coordinated by the brain is not clear. In Drosophila, male-specific P1 interneurons promote courtship song, as well as a persistent internal state that prolongs courtship and enhances aggressiveness. However, P1 neurons themselves are not persistently active. Here, we identify pCd neurons as persistently active, indirect P1 targets that are required for P1-evoked persistent courtship and aggression. Acute activation of pCd neurons alone is inefficacious but enhances and prolongs courtship or aggression promoted by female cues. Brief female exposure induces a persistent increase in male aggressiveness, an effect abrogated by interruption of pCd activity. pCd activity is not sufficient but necessary for persistent physiological activity, implying an essential role in a persistence network. Thus, P1 neurons coordinate both command-like control of courtship song and a persistent internal state of social arousal mediated by pCd neurons.",Ann Kennedy;Hui Chiu;Farhan Mohammad;Adam Claridge-Chang;David J Anderson

Post-embryonically, epigenetic signaling within neurons has been associated with impaired learning, autism, ataxia, and schizophrenia. Epigenetic factors are also enriched in glial cells. However, little is known about epigenetic signaling in glia and nothing is known about the intersection of glial epigenetic signaling and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. During a screen for genes involved in presynaptic homeostatic synaptic plasticity, we identified an essential role for the histone acetyltransferase and deubiquitinase SAGA complex in peripheral glia. We present evidence that the SAGA complex is necessary for homeostatic plasticity, demonstrating involvement of four new genes in homeostatic plasticity. This is also evidence that glia participate in presynaptic homeostatic plasticity, invoking previously unexplored intercellular, homeostatic signaling at a tripartite synapse. We show, mechanistically, SAGA signaling regulates the composition of and signaling from the extracellular matrix during homeostatic plasticity.",Danielle T Morency;Nathan Harris;Graeme W Davis

Here we used in vivo two-photon microscopy in awake head-fixed mice to assess the role of spontaneous vasomotion in paravascular clearance. Vasomotion correlated with paravascular clearance of fluorescent dextran from the interstitial fluid. Increasing the amplitude of vasomotion by means of visually evoked vascular responses resulted in increased clearance rates in the visual cortex of awake mice. Evoked vascular reactivity was impaired in mice with CAA, which corresponded to slower clearance rates. Our findings suggest that low-frequency arteriolar oscillations drive drainage of solutes.

68,Silvia Torretta,"Multiple schizophrenia (SCZ) risk loci may be involved in gene co-regulation mechanisms, and analysis of co-expressed gene networks may help to clarify SCZ molecular basis. We have previously identified a dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) co-expression module enriched for SCZ risk genes and associated with cognitive and neuroimaging phenotypes of SCZ, as well as with response to treatment with antipsychotics. Here we aimed to identify regulatory factors modulating this co-expression module and their relevance to SCZ.We performed motif enrichment analysis to identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites in human promoters of genes co-expressed with DRD2. Then, we measured transcript levels of a group of these genes in primary mouse cortical neurons in basal conditions and upon overexpression and knockdown of predicted TFs. Finally, we analyzed expression levels of these TFs in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of SCZ patients.Our in silico analysis revealed enrichment for NURR1 and ERR1 binding sites. In neuronal cultures, the expression of genes either relevant to SCZ risk (Drd2, Gatad2a, Slc28a1, Cnr1) or indexing co-expression in our module (Btg4, Chit1, Osr1, Gpld1) was significantly modified by gain and loss of Nurr1 and Err1. Postmortem DLPFC expression data analysis showed decreased expression levels of NURR1 and ERR1 in patients with SCZ. For NURR1 such decreased expression is associated with treatment with antipsychotics.Our results show that NURR1 and ERR1 modulate the transcription of DRD2 co-expression partners and support the hypothesis that NURR1 is involved in the response to SCZ treatment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn the present study, we provide in silico and experimental evidence for a role of the TFs NURR1 and ERR1 in modulating the expression pattern of genes co-expressed with DRD2 in human DLPFC. Notably, genetic variations in these genes is associated with SCZ risk and behavioral and neuroimaging phenotypes of the disease, as well as with response to treatment.

69,Konstantina Kilteni,"Since the early 1970s, numerous behavioral studies have shown that self-generated touch feels less intense than the same touch applied externally. Computational motor control theories have suggested that cerebellar internal models predict the somatosensory consequences of our movements and that these predictions attenuate the perception of the actual touch. Despite this influential theoretical framework, little is known about the neural basis of this predictive attenuation. This is due to the limited number of neuroimaging studies, the presence of conflicting results about the role and the location of cerebellar activity, and the lack of behavioral measures accompanying the neural findings. Here, we combined psychophysics with functional magnetic resonance imaging to detect the neural processes underlying somatosensory attenuation in male and female healthy human participants. Activity in bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was attenuated when the touch was presented during a self-generated movement (self-generated touch) than in the absence of movement (external touch). An additional attenuation effect was observed in the cerebellum that is ipsilateral to the passive limb receiving the touch. Importantly, we further found that the degree of functional connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was linearly and positively related to the degree of behaviorally assessed attenuation; that is, the more participants perceptually attenuated their self-generated touches, the stronger this corticocerebellar coupling. Collectively, these results suggest that the ipsilateral cerebellum is fundamental in predicting self-generated touch and that this structure implements somatosensory attenuation via its functional connectivity with somatosensory areas.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen we touch our hand with the other, the resulting sensation feels less intense than when another person or a machine touches our hand with the same intensity. Early computational motor control theories have proposed that the cerebellum predicts and cancels the sensory consequences of our movements; however, the neural correlates of this cancelation remain unknown. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that the more participants attenuate the perception of their self-generated touch, the stronger the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the somatosensory cortical areas. This provides conclusive evidence about the role of the cerebellum in predicting the sensory feedback of our movements and in attenuating the associated percepts via its connections to early somatosensory areas.",H Henrik Ehrsson
70,Zachary A Abecassis,"Within the basal ganglia circuit, the external globus pallidus (GPe) is critically involved in motor control. Aside from Foxp2+ neurons and ChAT+ neurons that have been established as unique neuron types, there is little consensus on the classification of GPe neurons. Properties of the remaining neuron types are poorly-defined. In this study, we leverage new mouse lines, viral tools, and molecular markers to better define GPe neuron subtypes. We found that Sox6 represents a novel, defining marker for GPe neuron subtypes. Lhx6+ neurons that lack the expression of Sox6 were devoid of both parvalbumin and Npas1. This result confirms previous assertions of the existence of a unique Lhx6+ population. Neurons that arise from the Dbx1+ lineage were similarly abundant in the GPe and displayed a heterogeneous makeup. Importantly, tracing experiments revealed that Npas1+-Nkx2.1+ neurons represent the principal non-cholinergic, cortically-projecting neurons. In other words, they form the pallido-cortical arm of the cortico-pallido-cortical loop. Our data further described that pyramidal-tract neurons in the cortex collateralized within the GPe, forming a closed-loop system between the two brain structures. Overall, our findings reconcile some of the discrepancies that arose from differences in techniques or the reliance on pre-existing tools. While spatial distribution and electrophysiological properties of GPe neurons reaffirm the diversification of GPe subtypes, statistical analyses strongly support the notion that these neuron subtypes can be categorized under the two principal neuron classes-i.e., PV+ neurons and Npas1+ neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe poor understanding of the neuronal composition in the GPe undermines our ability to interrogate its precise behavioral and disease involvements. In this study, twelve different genetic crosses were used, hundreds of neurons were electrophysiologically-characterized, and over 100,000 neurons were histologically- and/or anatomically-profiled. Our current study further establishes the segregation of GPe neuron classes and illustrates the complexity of GPe neurons in adult mice. Our results support the idea that Npas1+-Nkx2.1+ neurons are a distinct GPe neuron subclass. By providing a detailed analysis of the organization of the cortico-pallidal-cortical projection, our findings establish the cellular and circuit substrates that can be important for motor function and dysfunction.",Brianna L Berceau;Phyo H Win;Daniela Garcia;Harry S Xenias;Qiaoling Cui;Arin Pamukcu;Suraj Cherian;Vivian M Hernández;Uree Chon;Byung Kook Lim;Yongsoo Kim;Nicholas J Justice;Raj Awatramani;Bryan M Hooks;Charles R Gerfen;Simina M Boca;C Savio Chan
71,Alvaro Campero,"Gravity retraction is an underutilized adjunct in neurosurgery. Gravity is gentler than retractor blades; it does not cause brain edema or injury, and it tends to open natural subarachnoidal plans to deep lesions.1-3 A good example of this is the supracerebellar infratrochlear approach4-7 in semisitting position for resection to a midbrain cavernous malformation. This approach was selected because the cavernous malformation was 1 mm under the lateral mesencephalic sulcus.

72,Joseph Haynes,"We present a patient who was diagnosed 20 yr prior to current presentation with a spinal arteriovenous malformation. This patient had a 10-yr history of worsening back pain (and underwent lumbar fusion), urinary dysfunction leading to 3-yr dependence on intermittent catheterization, lower extremity paresthesias and pain, and progressive weakness with multiple falls, leading to walker then wheelchair dependence for mobility. Magnetic resonance studies showed extensive thoracic cord expansion and edema with enlarged spinal cord surface veins and flow voids extending from spinal levels T6 to the conus medullaris. Partial embolization at an outside institution elicited transient symptom improvement. Repeated spinal angiogram demonstrated persistent T10 pial arteriovenous fistula (AVF) supplied by the posterior spinal artery arising from the right T11 segmental artery as well as by the anterior spinal artery from the left T10 segmental artery. Because additional embolization carried significant risk, we planned open surgery with fistula resection. Informed consent for the surgery and video recording was obtained. The patient was placed in the prone position, and a radial artery access was obtained for intraoperative angiogram. Following a posterior T9-T11 laminectomy and dural opening, a pial dissection was performed to expose the AVF. Intraoperative indocyanine green angiography was used to assist in identifying the feeders and major drainage of the AVF. Post-AVF resection, a formal intraoperative radial access spinal angiogram demonstrated complete resection of the lesion with no residual shunt or early venous drainage. The patient improved significantly and, on last follow-up, is ambulating without any assistive devices.",Maksim Shapiro;Eytan Raz;Anthony Frempong-Boadu;Erez Nossek
73,Jason I Liounakos,"Minimally invasive spine surgery has the potential to reduce soft tissue destruction, blood loss, postoperative pain, and overall perioperative morbidity while accelerating recovery. Robotic guidance systems are relatively new tools in the minimally invasive surgeon's armamentarium, striving to increase accuracy of instrumentation placement, decrease complications, reduce radiation burden, and enhance surgical ergonomics in order to improve efficiency and maximize patient outcomes. We present the case of a 78-yr-old male with intractable lower back and bilateral lower extremity pain with multilevel degenerative spondylosis. The procedure performed was a L3-5 robotic-assisted endoscopic transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) utilizing the Mazor X robotic guidance system (Medtronic) for both percutaneous pedicle screw placement, as well as trajectory localization for endoscopic discectomy and percutaneous interbody delivery. Previously, clinical and radiographic success has been published regarding the awake, endoscopic TLIF.1 We document the first use of robotic guidance for disc space localization and its combination with endoscopy to achieve interbody fusion, utilizing an expandable, allograft-filled mesh interbody device.2 This video demonstrates appropriate patient positioning, work flow for this unique technique, and the benefits of using robotic guidance to plan and execute percutaneous trajectories through Kambin's triangle.

74,Albert McAnsah Isaacs,"BACKGROUND
Determining an optimal location within the right atrium (RA) for placement of the distal ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt catheter offer several operative challenges that place patients at risk for perioperative complications and downstream VA shunt failure. Utilizing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance to place distal VA shunt catheters may help to circumvent these risks.


OBJECTIVE
To review our current practice of VA shunt insertion using TEE guidance.


METHODS
A retrospective review of all consecutive patients who underwent VA shunt procedures between December 19, 2016 and January 22, 2019, during which time intraoperative TEE was used for shunt placement was performed. Data on the time required for shunt placement and total procedure time, baseline echocardiography findings, and short- and long-term complications of shunt placement were assessed.


RESULTS
A total of 33 patients underwent VA shunt procedures, with a median follow-up time of 250 (88-412) d. The only immediate complication related to shunt placement or TEE use was transient ectopy in 1 patient. The mean time for atrial catheter insertion was 12.6 ± 4.8 min. Right-heart catheters were inserted between the RA-superior vena cava junction and 22 mm within the RA in all but 3 procedures. A total of 7/33 patients (21%) underwent shunt revision. Indications for revisions included distal clots, proximal obstruction, positive blood culture, and shunt valve revision. No other complications of VA shunt insertion were reported.


CONCLUSION
VA shunt insertion using TEE allows for precise distal catheter placement. Early patient experience confirms this technique has a low complication rate.",Danae Krahn;Andrew M Walker;Heather Hurdle;Mark G Hamilton
75,Qazi Zeeshan,"This 42-yr-old man presented with a history of sudden right-sided facial and right arm weakness and dysarthria. Head computed tomography showed a left frontal-parietal blood clot. An intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a left subcortical postcentral, Spetzler-Martin Grade 3 arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a diffuse nidus, measuring 2.1 × 1.5 cm, supplied by branches of the left MCA, and draining into a cortical vein and a deep vein, which was going toward the ventricle. Preoperative embolization was not possible.  The patient underwent left frontal-parietal craniotomy with intraoperative motor and sensory mapping. No arterialized veins were visible on the cortical surface. Neuronavigation localized the AVM in the subcortical postcentral gyrus. Through an incision in the postcentral sulcus, microdissection led to a yellowish gliotic plane. The large cortical vein was in the gliotic area and traced to the AVM. Circumferential microdissection was performed around the AVM. It had a very diffuse nidus; the arterial feeders were cauterized and divided, and the superior superficial and inferior deep draining veins were finally occluded, and AVM was removed.  Postoperative angiogram showed total removal of the AVM. At discharge, his right arm weakness had improved (power 5/5), and facial weakness and dysarthria were improving (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 2). At 1-yr follow-up, facial weakness and dysarthria had improved considerably, and patient returned to work (mRS 1).  This video shows microsurgical resection of an AVM by neuronavigation and tracing of the subcortical draining vein. The technique of cauterizing the perforating arteries after temporary clipping with flow arrest is shown in the video. Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the surgery that included videotaping of the procedure and its distribution for educational purposes.

76,Mirza Pojskić,"In this video, we demonstrate microsurgical resection of IV ventricle subependymoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first video case report of a microsurgical resection of subependymoma of the IV ventricle in the peer-reviewed English literature. Subependymomas are benign central nervous system tumors, typically arising in ventricular spaces, mostly in the IV and lateral ventricles.1-3 They are isointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with minimal or no enhancement.4 Microsurgery remains the mainstay treatment. Complete tumor resection is possible and curative with excellent prognosis.1,5-7 Although the clinical course appears benign, the inability to diagnose them radiographically with certainty and the possibility of an alternative malignant lesion support a low threshold for early and safe resection.8 A 39-yr-old man presented with severe headache and balance problems. Pre- and postcontrast neuroaxis MRI revealed a centrally located IV ventricle lesion without hydrocephalus. The aim of the surgery was complete tumor resection. Surgery was performed in the prone position by the senior author (KIA) with intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring. A small suboccipital craniotomy and C1 posterior arch removal was done. After opening the dura and arachnoid membrane, the tumor was identified and meticulously dissected from the adjacent posterior inferior cerebellar artery and the floor of the fourth ventricle and from brain stem white matter at the tumor-neural tissue interface to avoid brainstem interference.

77,Nitesh V Patel,"Fusiform aneurysms remain challenging entities to treat, as maintenance of flow and prevention of branch occlusion are concerns. Use of endovascular stents may risk nearby branch occlusion. We present a 31-yr-old male with a prior subarachnoid hemorrhage from a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 aneurysm. Informed consent for use of the operative video and information was obtained from the patient. Initially, open clipping was performed with noted residual because of risk of nearby branches. On angiography, a growing fusiform segment distal to the initial aneurysm was noted. The patient was referred to our institution for this finding, and a multidisciplinary team reviewed the case. Endovascular treatment was felt to be risky, as stenting could jail nearby MCA branches. Clipping would also risk occlusion because of scaring from previous hemorrhage. Sufficient flow would be needed, and because the ipsilateral superficial temporal artery was sacrificed in the initial craniotomy, the internal maxillary artery (IMAX) was chosen as the bypass source. A cerebrovascular neurosurgeon, skull base otolaryngologist, and vascular surgeon worked together to perform a left-side IMAX to MCA bypass using an anterior tibial artery graft under 3-dimensional exoscopic visualization. Specifically, a 9-0 nylon suture on a BV-130 needle along with straight and tying forceps were used along with heparinized saline. The bypass was noted to be of robust flow, and the patient did very well on postoperative follow-up. The utilization of an anterior tibial artery graft, IMAX exposure, and corresponding bypass provides educational value, as there are only a limited number of videos on this topic.",Barbara Ligas;Shashank Gandhi;Jason Ellis;Rafael Ortiz;Peter Costantino;Khalil Qato;David J Langer
78,Samuel G McClugage,"PURPOSE
Delayed intracranial hypertension (DIH) occurs most frequently in children with syndromic or multi-suture synostosis after surgical correction. The rarity of DIH in children with isolated non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (ISS) warrants follow-up evaluation by large craniofacial centers until skeletal maturity. This study reports the incidence of DIH in children following open repair for ISS by our center's craniofacial team.


METHODS
A single-center retrospective study of patients who underwent open calvarial vault remodeling (CVR) for ISS at our institution between November 2000 and November 2012 was performed. Syndromic and multi-suture synostosis patients were excluded. Demographic and follow-up data were extracted from the medical record for analysis until July 2017.


RESULTS
One hundred five patients with ISS were identified who had undergone CVR in the aforementioned timeframe. Average age at initial surgery was 11.7 ± 15.32 months. Mean follow-up in our craniofacial clinic was 4.94 ± 3.53 years, with 69 patients (65.7%) having follow-up in craniofacial clinic ≥ 3 years and 74 (70.5%) having follow-up ≥ 3 years in any clinic at our institution. Four patients (3.8%) had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors placed for symptoms concerning for DIH, one of which (0.95%) had confirmed DIH and underwent a second surgical procedure at 7.4 years of age. The patient presented late initially, having his first operation at 1.56 years of age.


CONCLUSION
One patient out of 105 (0.95%) developed DIH, confirmed by ICP monitoring, and required reoperation. The occurrence of DIH, albeit rare, remains an important topic to include in parental discussions and mandates long-term follow-up in this population.",Jacob R Lepard;Peter D Ray;John H Grant;Jeffrey P Blount;Curtis J Rozzelle;James M Johnston
79,Chan Lin,"Stomatopod crustaceans possess tripartite compound eyes; upper and lower hemispheres are separated by an equatorial midband of several ommatidial rows. The organization of stomatopod retinas is well established, but their optic lobes have been studied less. We used histological staining, immunolabeling, and fluorescent tracer injections to compare optic lobes in two 6-row midband species, Neogonodactylus oerstedii and Pseudosquilla ciliata, to those in two 2-row midband species, Squilla empusa and Alima pacifica. Compared to the 6-row species, we found structural differences in all optic neuropils in both 2-row species. Photoreceptor axons from 2-row midband ommatidia supply two sets of lamina cartridges; however, conspicuous spaces lacking lamina cartridges are observed in locations corresponding to where the cartridges of the upper four ommatidial rows of 6-row species would exist. The tripartite arrangement and enlarged projections containing fibers associated with the two rows of midband ommatidia can be traced throughout the entire optic lobe. However, 2-row species lack some features of medullar and lobular neuropils in 6-row species. Our results support the hypothesis that 2-row midband species are derived from a 6-row ancestor, and suggest specializations in the medulla and lobula found solely in 6-row species are important for color and polarization analysis.",Alice Chou;Thomas W Cronin
80,Karen Y Cheng,"Insects use vision to choose from a repertoire of flexible behaviors which they perform for survival. Decisions for behavioral plasticity are achieved through the neuromodulation of sensory processes, including motion vision. Here, we briefly review the anatomy of the insect motion vision system. Next, we review the neuromodulatory influences on motion vision. Serotonin modulates peripheral visual processing, whereas octopamine modulates all stages of visual processing tested to date. The physiological and behavioral states that elicit neuromodulation of motion vision include locomotion, changes in internal physiological state such as hunger, and changes in the external environment such as the presence of additional sensory cues. The direction of influence between these states and neuromodulators remains unknown. The influence of neuromodulators on motion vision circuitry has been revealed mostly through pharmacological application, which broadcasts widely with unnatural spatiotemporal dynamics. Thus, insight from this method is limited. Aminergic neurons likely act in local hierarchical fashion rather than globally as a group. As genetic tools advance in Drosophila, future work restricting the experimental focus to subpopulations of modulatory neurons will provide insight into the local functional modifications of visual circuits by interacting neuromodulators.",Mark A Frye
81,Gizem Sancer,"Specialized ommatidia harboring polarization-sensitive photoreceptors exist in the 'dorsal rim area' (DRA) of virtually all insects. Although downstream elements have been described both anatomically and physiologically throughout the optic lobes and the central brain of different species, little is known about their cellular and synaptic adaptations and how these shape their functional role in polarization vision. We have previously shown that in the DRA of Drosophila melanogaster, two distinct types of modality-specific 'distal medulla' cell types (Dm-DRA1 and Dm-DRA2) are post-synaptic to long visual fiber photoreceptors R7 and R8, respectively. Here we describe additional neuronal elements in the medulla neuropil that manifest modality-specific differences in the DRA region, including DRA-specific neuronal morphology, as well as differences in the structure of pre- or post-synaptic membranes. Furthermore, we show that certain cell types (medulla tangential cells and octopaminergic neuromodulatory cells) specifically avoid contacts with polarization-sensitive photoreceptors. Finally, while certain transmedullary cells are specifically absent from DRA medulla columns, other subtypes show specific wiring differences while still connecting the DRA to the lobula complex, as has previously been described in larger insects. This hints towards a complex circuit architecture with more than one pathway connecting polarization-sensitive DRA photoreceptors with the central brain.",Emil Kind;Juliane Uhlhorn;Julia Volkmann;Johannes Hammacher;Tuyen Pham;Haritz Plazaola-Sasieta;Mathias F Wernet
82,Chao Deng,"Pramipexole (PPX) is a common drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanism allows PPX in the progression of Parkinson's disease remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of PPX in 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated neuroblastoma cells and explore the interaction between PPX and miR-494-3p/brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) axis. SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells challenged by MPP+ were used as cellular model of Parkinson's disease and incubated with PPX. The expression levels of miR-494-3p and BDNF were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot. Neurotoxicity was investigated by cell apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress. The target association between miR-494-3p and BDNF was confirmed by luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. miR-494-3p expression was increased and BDNF level was decreased in MPP+-treated SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells, which were reversed by introduction of PPX. Pramipexole attenuated cell apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress in MPP+-treated SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells. Knockdown of miR-494-3p also suppressed neurotoxicity induced by MPP+ in SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells. BDNF was validated as a target of miR-494-3p and its silence abated the suppressive effect of miR-494-3p on MPP+-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, addition of miR-494-3p and silence of BDNF mitigated the effect of PPX on MPP+-induced neurotoxicity. PPX inhibited MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells by decreasing miR-494-3p and increasing BDNF, indicating the potential therapeutic effect of PPX on Parkinson's disease.",Jianping Zhu;Junlan Yuan;Yong Xiang;Li Dai
83,Franklin Lima,"BACKGROUND
Surgical access to the second (V2, maxillary) and third (V3, mandibular) branches of the trigeminal nerve (V) has been classically through a transoral approach. Increasing expertise with endoscopic anatomy has achieved less invasive, more efficient access to skull base structures. The authors present a surgical technique using an endoscopic endonasal approach for the treatment of painful V2 neuropathy.


METHODS
Endoscopic endonasal dissections using a transmaxillary approach were performed in four formalin-fixed cadaver heads to expose the V2 branch of the trigeminal nerve. Relevant surgical anatomy was evaluated and anatomic parameters for neurectomy were identified.


RESULTS
Endoscopic endonasal transmaxillary approaches completed bilaterally to the pterygopalatine and pterygomaxillary fossae exposed the V2 branch where it emerged from the foramen rotundum. The anatomy defined for the location of neurectomy was determined to be the point where V2 emerged from the foramen rotundum into the pterygopalatine fossa. The technique was then performed in 3 patients with intractable painful V2 neuropathy.


CONCLUSIONS
In our cadaveric study and clinical cases, the endoscopic endonasal approach to the pterygopalatine fossa achieved effective exposure and treatment of isolated V2 painful neuropathy. Important surgical steps to visualize the maxillary nerve and its branches and key landmarks of the pterygopalatine fossa are discussed. This minimally invasive approach appears to be a valid alternative for select patients with painful V2 trigeminal neuropathy.",Norberto Andaluz;Lee A Zimmer
84,Sotirios Katsigiannis,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
To evaluate posterolateral myelotomy (PLM) as a surgical method for all cases of intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCT) by assessing the surgical and functional outcomes of patients treated in our clinic.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with IMSCT who underwent surgery using PLM from 2013 to 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Objective and quantitative assessment of the preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up neurological status was performed by using the modified McCormick functional schema and sensory pain scale.


RESULTS
A total of 33 operations were performed on 27 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The mean grade on the McCormick functional schema increased insignificantly from 2.0 preoperatively to 2.3 immediately postoperatively and decreased back to 2.1 at the follow-up examination. Just one patient exhibited a transient proprioception deficit. Significant pain relief was observed as expressed in an improvement of mean grade on the sensory pain scale. Only in two cases was late neuropathic pain reported. A gross total resection/subtotal resection (GTR/STR) was achieved in all cases of hemangioblastoma and cavernoma, while for the majority of astrocytomas, only partial removal was accomplished. For ependymoma, which represents the most common IMSCT, a GTR/STR was realized in 12 cases (86%). A statistically significant difference (p = 0.027) was found when comparing the extent of tumor resection (EOR) between the two most common IMSCT, i.e., ependymoma and astrocytoma.


CONCLUSION
PLM may be considered a reliable surgical method for IMSCT, as it combines a satisfactory EOR with reduced risk of tissue damage and excellent pain relief.",Anne Elisabeth Carolus;Kirsten Schmieder;Christopher Brenke

86,Herschel Wilde,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies have not evaluated the impact of illness severity and postrupture procedures in the cost of care for intracranial aneurysms. We hypothesize that the severity of aneurysm rupture and the aggressiveness of postrupture interventions play a role in cost.


METHODS
The Value Driven Outcomes database was used to assess direct patient cost during the treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysm with clipping, coiling, and Pipeline flow diverters.


RESULTS
One hundred ninety-eight patients (mean age 52.8 ± 14.1 years; 40.0% male) underwent craniotomy (64.6%), coiling (26.7%), or flow diversion (8.6%). Coiling was 1.4× more expensive than clipping (p = .005) and flow diversion was 1.7× more expensive than clipping (p < .001). More severe illness as measured by American Society of Anesthesia, Hunt/Hess, and Fisher scales incurred higher costs than less severe illness (p < .05). Use of a lumbar drain protocol to reduce subarachnoid hemorrhage and use of an external ventricular drain to manage intracranial pressure were associated with reduced (p = .05) and increased (p < .001) total costs, respectively. Patients with severe vasospasm (p < .005), those that received shunts (p < .001), and those who had complications (p < .001) had higher costs. Multivariate analysis showed that procedure type, length of stay, number of angiograms, vasospasm severity, disposition, and year of treatment were independent predictors of cost.


CONCLUSIONS
These results show for the first time that disease and vasospasm severity and intensity of treatment directly impact the cost of care for patients with aneurysms in the USA.

87,Phabinly J Gabriel,"BACKGROUND
The ""double flap"" reconstruction technique, comprised of a simultaneous vascularized pedicled pericranial flap (PCF) and pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF), can be used to repair anterior skull base defects after a combined cranionasal or transbasal-endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has been performed to remove malignant anterior skull base tumors. The use of two vascularized flaps may potentially decrease the incidence of post-radiation flap necrosis and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks after radiation therapy.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective review of a prospective skull base database on patients who underwent the double flap reconstruction technique after a combined transbasal-EEA approach. Data collected for each patient included demographics, method of tumor resection and repair, complications, tumor recurrence, and follow-up.


RESULTS
Nine patients who underwent a combined transbasal-EEA approach for resection of anterior skull base tumors with significant intracranial extension followed by reconstruction of the cranial base using the double flap technique. Four were men and five were women, with a mean age of 49 years (range, 15-68 years). There was no postoperative CSF leakage detected or complications of infection, meningitis, mucocele, or tension pneumocephalus after a mean follow-up of 35.7 months (range, 4.5-98 months). Seven of the nine patients underwent adjuvant radiation without flap necrosis. Local tumor recurrence was not observed in any of the patients at last follow-up; however, one patient developed distant brain metastasis.


CONCLUSION
The simultaneous PCF and NSF double flap reconstruction is an effective technique in preventing postoperative CSF leakage and post-radiation necrosis when repairing anterior skull base defects after combined transbasal-EEA approaches. This technique may be useful in patients anticipated to undergo postoperative radiation therapy.",Gurkirat Kohli;Wayne D Hsueh;Jean Anderson Eloy;James K Liu
88,Anjuna Reghunath,"Spinal dysraphism is an umbrella term describing herniation of meninges or neural elements through defective neural arch. They can be broadly categorized into open and closed types. MRI is the investigation of choice to study neural abnormalities and to assess the severity of hydrocephalus and Chiari malformation. Knowledge of the embryology of these disorders is valuable in correctly identifying the type of dysraphism. The aim of surgery is untethering and dural reconstruction. Accurate depiction of the abnormal anatomy in cases of spinal dysraphism is of utmost importance for surgical management of these patients. MRI makes this possible due to its excellent soft tissue contrast resolution and multiplanar capability, allowing the radiologist to evaluate the intricate details in small pediatric spinal structures. Imaging enlightens the surgeons about the status of spinal cord and other associated abnormalities and helps detect re-tethering in operated cases. Besides, antenatal surgery to repair myelomeningoceles has made detection of open dysraphisms on fetal MRI and antenatal ultrasound critical. The purpose of this review is to describe the development of spine, illustrate the myriad imaging features of open and closed spinal dysraphisms, and enlist the reporting points the operating surgeon seeks from the radiologist.",Rohini Gupta Ghasi;Ankita Aggarwal
89,Michael George Zaki Ghali,"Sphenoid wing dural AVFs represent a rare clinical entity. These lesions may be asymptomatic or present with focal neurologic deficits, intracranial venous hypertension, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and diagnostic imaging. They are alternatively classified as lesions of either the greater or lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. We performed a search of the PubMed database of studies evaluating the clinical behavior and surgical and endovascular therapies of these lesions. Dural AVFs draining into the superficial middle cerebral vein and/or laterocavernous sinus, or rather, lesions of the greater wing of the sphenoid, exhibit a greater likelihood of developing an aggressive clinical course, with higher probability of cortical venous reflux and consequent intracranial venous hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, and symptomatic presentation. Dural AVFs of the sphenoparietal sinus, that is, lesions of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, typically exhibit a more benign clinical course, as there is a prominent epidural venous drainage into the cavernous sinus, reducing the risk of cortical venous reflux, and consequently, the probability of intracranial venous hypertension, hemorrhage, and floridly symptomatic presentation. These lesions may be treated via surgical clipping of the fistulous point, transarterial or transvenous embolization, and/or stereotactic radiosurgery. Though surgical intervention was the principal therapy due to facility of craniotomy access to the fistulous point, embolization has become standard of care permitted by innovation in endovascular technology.

Patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) typically show progressive muscle weakness, respiratory dysfunction and minor cardiac involvement. Characteristics and modalities of motor and respiratory rehabilitation in LOPD are not well defined and specific guidelines are lacking. Therefore, we evaluated the role of physical activity, therapeutic exercise, and pulmonary rehabilitation programs in order to promote an appropriate management of motor and respiratory dysfunctions and improve QoL in patients with LOPD. We propose two operational protocols: one for an adapted physical activity (APA) plan and the other for an individual rehabilitation plan, particularly focused on therapeutic exercise (TE) and respiratory rehabilitation.",Michele Vitacca;Elena Carraro;Carmelo Chisari;Pietro Fiore;Sonia Messina;Tiziana Mongini;Antimo Moretti;Valeria A Sansone;Antonio Toscano;Gabriele Siciliano; 
91,Kimberly L Ray,"Higher cognitive functioning is supported by adaptive reconfiguration of large-scale functional brain networks. Cognitive control (CC), which plays a vital role in flexibly guiding cognition and behavior in accordance with our goals, supports a range of executive functions via distributed brain networks. These networks process information dynamically and can be represented as functional connectivity changes between network elements. Using graph theory, we explored context-dependent network reorganization in 56 healthy adults performing fMRI tasks from two cognitive domains that varied in CC and episodic-memory demands. We examined whole-brain modular structure during the DPX task, which engages proactive CC in the frontal-parietal cognitive-control network (FPN), and the RiSE task, which manipulates CC demands at encoding and retrieval during episodic-memory processing, and engages FPN, the medial-temporal lobe and other memory-related networks in a context dependent manner. Analyses revealed different levels of network integration and segregation. Modularity analyses revealed greater brain-wide integration across tasks in high CC conditions compared to low CC conditions. Greater network reorganization occurred in the RiSE memory task, which is thought to require coordination across multiple brain networks, than in the DPX cognitive-control task. Finally, FPN, ventral attention, and visual systems showed within network connectivity effects of cognitive control; however, these cognitive systems displayed varying levels of network reorganization. These findings provide insight into how brain networks reorganize to support differing task contexts, suggesting that the FPN flexibly segregates during focused proactive control and integrates to support control in other domains such as episodic memory.",J Daniel Ragland;Angus W MacDonald;James M Gold;Steven M Silverstein;Deanna M Barch;Cameron S Carter
92,Senay Yildiz Celik,"Late-onset myasthenia gravis (LOMG) is a unique MG subgroup. More information is needed on its subgroups such as non-thymomatous generalized LOMG. We evaluated the effect of demographic, clinical, and serological factors as well as different immunosuppressive modalities on outcome in generalized non-thymomatous LOMG with onset ≥ 50 years. Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Clinical Classification, MGFA postintervention score (MGFA PIS) and MG Composite scores were obtained to define the severity of disease and clinical outcome. In 95 patients with generalized non-thymomatous LOMG, 60 (63%) were men, 45 (47%) had mild disease, 80 (84%) were anti-AChR, and 56 (61%) were anti-titin positive. In those who received immunosuppressives and provided the clinical scores (84 patients), 50 (60%) had favorable outcome (MGFA PIS categories of complete stable remission, pharmacological remission and minimal manifestations) at the end of 3 years. Use of prednisone + azathioprine had significantly positive effect on outcome. The presence of anti-titin antibodies had no significant effect on severity and outcome. Five anti-MuSK-positive patients had favorable outcome. In conclusion, the presence of neither anti-titin nor anti-MuSK antibodies points to unfavorable outcome. Prednisone and azathioprine combination has beneficial effects in non-thymomatous generalized LOMG.",Hacer Durmus;Vuslat Yilmaz;Guher Saruhan Direskeneli;Yesim Gulsen Parman;Piraye Serdaroglu Oflazer;Feza Deymeer
93,Andrew H Dolinko,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of blindness for individuals under the age of 65. This loss of vision can be due to ischemia, neovascularization, and/or diabetic macular edema, which are caused by breakdown of the blood-retina barrier at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and inner retinal vasculature. The prevalence of diabetes and its complications differ between Caucasian-Americans and certain minority populations, such as African-Americans and Asian-Americans. Individuals can be classified by their mitochondrial haplogroups, which are collections of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) representing ancient geographic origins of populations. In this study, we compared the responses of diabetic human RPE cybrids, cell lines containing identical nuclei but mitochondria from either European (maternal European) or maternal African or Asian individuals, to hypoxia and high glucose levels. The African and Asian diabetic ([Afr+Asi]/DM) cybrids showed (1) resistance to both hyperglycemic and hypoxic stresses; (2) downregulation of pro-apoptotic indicator BAX; (3) upregulation of DNA methylation genes, such as DNMT3A and DNMT3B; and (4) resistance to DNA demethylation by the methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) compared to European diabetic (Euro/DM) cybrids. Our findings suggest that mitochondria from African and Asian diabetic subjects possess a ""metabolic memory"" that confers resistance against hyperglycemia, hypoxia, and demethylation, and that this ""metabolic memory"" can be transferred into the RPE cybrid cell lines in vitro.",Marilyn Chwa;Shari R Atilano;M Cristina Kenney
94,Abdel G Elkahloun,"Preclinical experiments and clinical trials demonstrated that angiotensin II AT1 receptor overactivity associates with aging and cellular senescence and that AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) protect from age-related brain disorders. In a primary neuronal culture submitted to glutamate excitotoxicity, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed expression of several hundred genes altered by glutamate and normalized by candesartan correlated with changes in expression in Alzheimer's patient's hippocampus. To further establish whether our data correlated with gene expression alterations associated with aging and senescence, we compared our global transcriptional data with additional published datasets, including alterations in gene expression in the neocortex and cerebellum of old mice, human frontal cortex after age of 40, gene alterations in the Werner syndrome, rodent caloric restriction, Ras and oncogene-induced senescence in fibroblasts, and to tissues besides the brain such as the muscle and kidney. The most significant and enriched pathways associated with aging and senescence were positively correlated with alterations in gene expression in glutamate-injured neurons and, conversely, negatively correlated when the injured neurons were treated with candesartan. Our results involve multiple genes and pathways, including CAV1, CCND1, CDKN1A, CHEK1, ICAM1, IL-1B, IL-6, MAPK14, PTGS2, SERPINE1, and TP53, encoding proteins associated with aging and senescence hallmarks, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, cell cycle and mitochondrial function alterations, insulin resistance, genomic instability including telomere shortening and DNA damage, and the senescent-associated secretory phenotype. Our results demonstrate that AT1 receptor blockade ameliorates central mechanisms of aging and senescence. Using ARBs for prevention and treatment of age-related disorders has important translational value.",Juan M Saavedra
95,Jayantee Kalita,"The pattern of copper (Cu) toxicity in humans is similar to Wilson disease, and they have movement disorders and frequent involvement of corpus striatum. The extent of cell deaths in corpus striatum may be the basis of movement disorder and may be confirmed in the experimental study. To evaluate the extent of apoptosis and glial activation in corpus striatum following Cu toxicity in a rat model, and correlate these with spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA), six male Wistar rats were fed normal saline (group I) and another six were fed copper sulfate 100 mg/kgBWt/daily orally (group II). At 1 month, neurobehavioral studies including SLA, rotarod, and grip strength were done. Corpus striatum was removed and was subjected to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. The concentration of tissue Cu, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutamate were measured. Group II rats had higher expression of caspase-3 (Mean ± SEM 32.67 ± 1.46 vs 4.47 ± 1.08; p < 0.01) and GFAP (41.81 ± 1.68 vs 31.82 ± 1.27; p < 0.01) compared with group I. Neurobehavioral studies revealed reduced total distance traveled, time moving, the number of rearing, latency to fall on the rotarod, grip strength, and increased resting time compared with group I. The expression of GFAP and caspase-3 correlated with SLA parameters, tissue Cu, GSH, MDA, TAC, and glutamate levels. The impaired locomotor activity in Cu toxicity rats is due to apoptotic and inflammatory-mediated cell death in the corpus striatum because of Cu-mediated oxidative stress and excitotoxicity.",Vijay Kumar;Usha K Misra;Himangsu K Bora
96,Xu Liu,"Polymorphisms in microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with ischemic stroke occurrence and traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. However, few studies have examined recurrent ischemic stroke as an outcome. Thus, the aim of our study was to examine association of miRNA gene polymorphisms (namely, miR-126 rs4636297, miR-149 rs2292832, miR-124 rs531564, miR-499 rs3746444, miR-143 rs12655723, and miR-122 rs17669) with recurrence of ischemic stroke. miRNA gene polymorphisms were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method in 657 patients with ischemic stroke. Association of miRNA polymorphisms with prognosis outcomes was examined by the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models. miR-122 rs17669 was significantly associated with recurrence risk of ischemic stroke under the recessive model. Cox regression analysis showed that the CC genotype of rs17669 was associated with an increased risk of 1.9-fold for stroke recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.879; 95% confidence interval = 1.182-2.985; P = 0.008). Further, this effect was more evident among the non-drinker and male subgroups. We found no difference in risk of recurrent ischemic stroke among the other five miRNA polymorphisms. Furthermore, we identified a significant association between the miR-149 rs2292832 polymorphism and age at onset of first-ever stroke. Altogether, miR-122 rs17669 is a significant predictor for the risk of recurrent stroke, independent of traditional risk factors.",Qianwen Wang;Ruixia Zhu

This model exhibits pathophysiological features similar to those reported in patients with PD, namely, striatal nitrosative and oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neural cytoarchitecture alteration. (-)Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and potent green tea catechin, has notable anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential protective effects of EGCG on ROT-induced motor and neurochemical dysfunctions in rats. Furthermore, we also aimed to study the neuroprotective mechanisms underlying these effects. ROT treatment (0.5 mg/kg s.c., 21 days) reduced body weight and induced significant motor impairments as assessed using an open-field test, rotarod test, grip strength measurement, and beam-crossing task. EGCG treatment (100 or 300 mg/kg i.p., 60 min prior to ROT administration, 21 days) prevented most of the ROT-induced motor impairments. Moreover, EGCG treatment reduced ROT-induced nitric oxide (NO) level and lipid peroxidation (LPO) production; increased the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), ATPase, and ETC enzymes and the levels of catecholamines in the striatum; and reduced the levels of neuroinflammatory and apoptotic markers. These results demonstrate the possible neuroprotective effects of EGCG against ROT-induced motor impairments, including anti-oxidatory effect, prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction, prevention of neurochemical deficiency, anti-neuroinflammatory effect, and anti-apoptotic effect. This is the first report about the neuroprotective effect of EGCG against ROT-induced motor impairments, and the above evidence provides a potential clinically relevant role for EGCG in delaying or treating human PD.",Mao-Hsien Wang;Kuo-Chi Chang;Hung-Sheng Soung;Chih-Hsiang Fang;Yi-Wen Lin;Keng-Yuan Li;Chih-Chuan Yang;Cheng-Chia Tsai
99,Pasquale Picone,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread form of dementia, characterized by memory loss and reduction of cognitive functions that strongly interfere with normal daily life. Numerous evidences show that aggregates of the amyloid beta peptide, formed by 39 to 42 amino acid residues (Aβ39-43), from soluble small oligomers to large fibrils are characteristic markers of this pathology. However, AD is a complex disease and its neurodegenerative molecular mechanism is not yet fully understood. Growing evidence suggests a link between Aβ polymorphic nature, oligomers and fibrils, and specific mechanisms of neurodegeneration. The Aβ variable nature and its multiplicity of interactions with different proteins and organelles reflect the complexity of this pathology. In this review, we analyze the effects of the interaction between Aβ peptide and different cellular compartments in relation to the different kinds and sizes of amyloid aggregates. In particular, Aβ interaction with different cell structures such as the plasma membrane, mitochondria, lysosomes, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum is discussed. Further, we analyze the Aβ peptide ability to modify the structure and function of the target organelle, inducing alteration of its physiological role thus contributing to the pathological event. Dysfunction of cellular components terminating with the activation of the cellular death mechanism and subsequent neurodegeneration is also taken into consideration.",Domenico Nuzzo;Daniela Giacomazza;Marta Di Carlo
100,Zhara Hakimi,"Inflammation can cause memory impairment. In the present study, the effect of carvacrol on brain tissue inflammation and oxidative stress as well as learning and memory in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged rats was evaluated. The animals were grouped and treated: (1) control which received vehicle instead of LPS and carvacrol, (2) LPS (1 mg/kg; i.p. 120 min before behavioral tests), and (3-5) in these groups, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg of carvacrol (i.p.) was administered 30 min prior to LPS. In a Morris water maze test, compared to LPS group, administration of all three doses of carvacrol shortened the elapsed time and the traveled distance to find the platform, while it prolonged the traveled time in the target area. In a passive avoidance test, administration of all 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg carvacrol significantly increased the latency at the 3 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the shock compared to the LPS group. Interleukin (IL)-6, malondialdehyde (MDA), and NO (nitric oxide) metabolites were increased in the brain by LPS injection, while thiol, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were decreased. Pretreatment with carvacrol reduced IL-6, NO metabolites, and MDA, while it improved thiol content, CAT, and SOD. The results indicated that carvacrol protected from learning and memory impairment and the brain tissue inflammation and oxidative stress in LPS-challenged rats.",Hossein Salmani;Narges Marefati;Zohre Arab;Zahra Gholamnezhad;Farimah Beheshti;Mohammad Naser Shafei;Mahmoud Hosseini
101,Amany Emam,"The teleost Astyanax mexicanus is one species extant in two readily available forms. One that lives in Mexican rivers and various convergent forms that live in nearby caves. These fish are born with eyes but in the cavefish, they degenerate during development. It is known that the lens of cavefish undergoes apoptosis and that some cells in the neuroretina also die. It has not been described, however, if glia and various components of the neuroretina form before complete eye degeneration. Here we examined the development of the retina of the closest living ancestor that lives in the rivers and two independently adapted of cavefish. We report that although the neuroretina is smaller and more compact, it has all cell types and layers including amacrine cells and Müller glia. While various makers for photoreceptors are present in the cavefish inner segments, the outer segments of the photoreceptors in cavefish are missing from the earliest stages examined. This shows that the machinery for visual transducing discs might still be present but not organized in one part of the cell. It is interesting to note that the deficiencies in Astyanax cavefish resemble retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa. This article is protected by copyright.

102,Antonia Stefanov,"Rod-cone degenerations e.g. Retinitis Pigmentosa are leading causes of blindness worldwide. Despite slow disease progression in humans, vision loss is inevitable, therefore development of vision restoration strategies is crucial. Among others, promising approaches include optogenetics and prosthetic implants, which aim to bypass lost photoreceptors. Naturally, the efficacy of these therapeutic strategies will depend on inner retinal structural and functional preservation. The present study shows that in photo inducible I307N rhodopsin mice (Tvrm4) a 12 k lux light exposure eliminates photoreceptors in the central retina in 1 week, but interneurons and their synapses are maintained for as long as 9 weeks post-induction. Despite bipolar cell dendritic retraction and moderate loss of horizontal cells, the survival rate of various cell types is very high. Significant preservation of conventional synapses and gap junctions in the inner plexiform layer is also observed. We found the number of synaptic ribbons to gradually decline and their ultrastructure to become transiently abnormal, although based on our findings intrinsic retinal architecture is maintained despite complete loss of photoreceptors. Unlike common rodent models of photoreceptor degeneration, where the disease phenotype often interferes with retinal development, in Tvrm4 mice the degenerative process can be induced after retinal development is complete. This time course more closely mimics the timing of disease onset in affected patients. Stability of the inner retina found in these mutants 2 months after photoreceptor degeneration suggests moderate, stereotyped remodeling in the early stages of the human disease and represents a promising finding for prompt approaches of vision restoration.

103,Vittoria Pagliarini,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by loss of function mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene and reduced expression of the SMN protein, leading to spinal motor neuron death, muscle weakness and atrophy. Although humans harbour the highly homologous SMN2 gene, its defective splicing regulation yields a truncated and unstable SMN protein. The first therapy for SMA was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and consists of an antisense oligonucleotide (Nusinersen) rendering SMN2 functional and thus improving patients' motor activity and quality of life. Nevertheless, not all patients equally respond to this therapy and the long-term tolerability and safety of Nusinersen are still unknown. Herein, in vivo splicing assays indicated that the HDAC inhibitor LBH589 is particularly efficient in rescuing the SMN2 splicing defect in SMA fibroblasts and SMA type-I mice-derived neural stem cells. Western blot analyses showed that LBH589 also causes a significant increase in SMN protein expression in SMA cells. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that LBH589 treatment induces widespread H4 acetylation of the entire SMN2 locus and selectively favour the inclusion of the disease-linked exon 7 in SMN2 mature mRNA. The combined treatment of SMA cells with sub-optimal doses of LBH589 and of an antisense oligonucleotide that mimic Nusinersen (ASO_ISSN1) elicits additive effects on SMN2 splicing and SMN protein expression. These findings suggest that HDAC inhibitors can potentiate the activity of Nusinersen and support the notion that ""SMN-plus"" combinatorial therapeutic approaches might represent an enhanced opportunity in the scenario of SMA therapy.",Marika Guerra;Valentina Di Rosa;Claudia Compagnucci;Claudio Sette
104,R S Duman,"The pathophysiology and treatment of depression has been the focus of intense research and while there is much that remains unknown, modern neurobiological approaches are making progress. This work demonstrates that stress and depression are associated with atrophy of neurons and reduced synaptic connectivity in brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex that contribute to depressive behaviors, and conversely that antidepressant treatment can reverse these deficits. The role of neurotrophic factors, particularly brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been of particular interest as these factors play a key role in activity dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity. Here we review the literature demonstrating that exposure to stress and depression decreases BDNF expression in the hippocampus and PFC and conversely that antidepressant treatment can up-regulate BDNF in the adult brain and reverse the effects of stress. We then focus on rapid acting antidepressants, particularly the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, which produces rapid synaptic and antidepressant behavioral actions that are dependent on activity dependent release of BDNF. This rapid release of BDNF differs from typical monoaminergic agents that require chronic administration to produce a slow induction of BDNF expression, consistent with the time lag for the therapeutic action of these agents. We review evidence that other classes of rapid acting agents also require BDNF release, demonstrating that this is a common, convergent downstream mechanism. Finally, we discuss evidence that the actions of ketamine are also dependent on another growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its complex interplay with BDNF.",S Deyama;M V Fogaça

106,Helena Marcelino,"Brain adenosine concentrations can reach micromolar concentrations in stressful situations such as stroke, neurodegenerative diseases or hypoxic regions of brain tumours. Adenosine can act by receptor-independent mechanism by reversing the reaction catalysed by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase, leading to SAH accumulation and inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases. Astrocytes are essential in maintaining brain homeostasis but their pathological activation and uncontrolled proliferation plays a role in neurodegeneration and glioma. Adenosine can affect cell proliferation, but the effect of increased adenosine concentration on proliferation of astrocytes is not clarified and was addressed in present work. Human astrocytes (HA) were treated for 3 days with test drugs. Cell proliferation/viability was assessed by the MTT assay and by cell counting. Cell death was evaluated by assessing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and by western blot analysis of αII-Spectrin cleavage. 30µM-Adenosine caused a 40%±3% (p < .05, n = 5) reduction in cell proliferation/viability, an effect reversed by 2U/ml-adenosine deaminase, but unchanged in the presence of antagonists of any of the adenosine receptors. Adenosine alone did not induce cell death. 100µM-Homocysteine alone caused 16%±3% (p < .05) decrease in HA proliferation. Combined action of adenosine and homocysteine decreased HA proliferation by 76%±4%, an effect higher (p < .05) than the sum of the effect of adenosine and homocysteine alone (56%±5%). The inhibitory effect of adenosine on HA proliferation/viability was mimicked by two adenosine kinase inhibitors and attenuated in the presence of folate (100µM) or SAM (50-100µM). The results suggest that adenosine reduces HA proliferation by a receptor-independent mechanism probably involving reversal of SAH hydrolase-catalysed reaction.",Vanda C Nogueira;Cecília R A Santos;Patrícia Quelhas;Tiago M A Carvalho;João Fonseca-Gomes;Joana Tomás;Maria J Diógenes;Ana M Sebastião;José F Cascalheira
107,Bertrand Bryche,"The olfactory mucosa, where the first step of odor detection occurs, is a privileged pathway for environmental toxicants and pathogens towards the central nervous system. Indeed, some pathogens can infect olfactory sensory neurons including their axons projecting to the olfactory bulb allowing them to bypass the blood-brain barrier and reach the central nervous system (CNS) through the so-called olfactory pathway. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major respiratory tract pathogen but there is growing evidence that RSV may lead to CNS impairments. However, the mechanisms involved in RSV entering into the CNS have been poorly described. In this study, we wanted to explore the capacity of RSV to reach the CNS via the olfactory pathway and to better characterize RSV cellular tropism in the nasal cavity. We first explored the distribution of RSV infectious sites in the nasal cavity by in vivo bioluminescence imaging and a tissue clearing protocol combined with deep-tissue imaging and 3D image analyses. This whole tissue characterization was confirmed with immunohistochemistry and molecular biology approaches.

108,Travis E Conley,"Studies have reported associations between environmental manganese (Mn) exposure and impaired cognition, attention, impulse control, and fine motor function in children. Our recent rodent studies established that elevated Mn exposure causes these impairments. Here, rats were exposed orally to 0, 25, or 50 mg Mn/kg/day during early postnatal life (PND 1-21) or lifelong to determine whether early life Mn exposure causes heightened behavioral reactivity in the open field, lasting changes in the catecholaminergic systems in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), altered dendritic spine density, and whether lifelong exposure exacerbates these effects. We also assessed astrocyte reactivity (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP), and astrocyte complement C3 and S100A10 protein levels as markers of A1 proinflammatory or A2 anti-inflammatory reactive astrocytes. Postnatal Mn exposure caused heightened behavioral reactivity during the first 5 - 10 min intervals of daily open field test sessions, consistent with impairments in arousal regulation. Mn exposure reduced the evoked release of norepinephrine (NE) and caused decreased protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine (DA) and NE transporters, and DA D1 receptors, along with increased DA D2 receptors. Mn also caused a lasting increase in reactive astrocytes (GFAP) exhibiting increased A1 and A2 phenotypes, with a greater induction of the A1 proinflammatory phenotype. These results demonstrate that early life Mn exposure causes broad lasting hypofunctioning of the mPFC catecholaminergic systems, consistent with the impaired arousal regulation, attention, impulse control, and fine motor function reported in these animals, suggesting that mPFC catecholaminergic dysfunction may underlie similar impairments reported in Mn-exposed children.",Stephane A Beaudin;Stephen M Lasley;Casimir A Fornal;Jasenia Hartman;Walter Uribe;Tooba Khan;Barbara J Strupp;Donald R Smith
109,Louis Jacob,"BACKGROUND
Little is known about the long-term association between transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke. Therefore, the goal of this study was to analyze the long-term risk of stroke and associated predictors in a large cohort of TIA patients followed in general practices in Germany.


METHODS
This study included patients with an initial TIA diagnosis and subsequently followed up in one of 1,262 general practices in Germany between January 2007 and December 2016 (N=19,824 patients). The primary outcome of the study was the risk of ischemic stroke within 10 years of the initial diagnosis of TIA. The secondary outcome was the identification of demographic, clinical, and pharmaceutical variables significantly associated with stroke in TIA patients.


RESULTS
Within 10 years of the initial TIA diagnosis, 18.3% of individuals were diagnosed with stroke. Age was positively associated with stroke, with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging from 1.88 in patients aged 51-60 years to 4.00 in those aged >80 years (reference group: patients aged ≤50 years). Furthermore, male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic heart diseases had an additional impact on the risk of stroke. Finally, new oral anticoagulants, heparins, diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and platelet aggregation inhibitors were identified as protective factors.


CONCLUSIONS
In a cohort of almost 20,000 TIA patients, 18.3% were diagnosed with stroke within 10 years after the TIA index event. Several demographic, clinical, and pharmaceutical variables significantly predicted the long-term risk of stroke in TIA patients.",Christian Tanislav;Karel Kostev
110,Tomasz Grzegorski,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating, not fully understood disease of the central nervous system. The first demyelinating clinical episode is called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of MS. Although the most common manifestations of CIS are long tracts dysfunction and unilateral optic neuritis, it can also include isolated brainstem syndromes, cerebellar involvement, and polysymptomatic clinical image. Recently, the frequency of CIS diagnosis has decreased due to the more sensitive and less specific 2017 McDonald criteria compared with the revisions from 2010. Not all patients with CIS develop MS. The risk of conversion can be estimated based on many predictive factors including epidemiological, ethnical, clinical, biochemical, radiological, immunogenetic, and other markers. The management of CIS is nowadays widely discussed among clinicians and neuroscientists. To date, interferons, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, cladribine, and some other agents have been evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies relying on large groups of patients with the first demyelinating event. All of these drugs were shown to have beneficial effects in patients with CIS and might be used routinely in the future. The goal of this article is to explore the most relevant topics regarding CIS as well as to provide the most recent information in the field. The review presents CIS definition, classification, clinical image, predictive factors, and management. What is more, this is one of very few reviews summarizing the topic in the light of the 2017 McDonald criteria.",Jacek Losy

112,Bethany A Freel,"Discerning the underlying pathological mechanisms and the identification of therapeutic strategies to treat individuals affected with rare neurological diseases has proven challenging due to a host of factors. For instance, rare diseases affecting the nervous system are inherently lacking in appropriate patient sample availability compared to more common diseases, while animal models often do not accurately recapitulate specific disease phenotypes. These challenges impede research that may otherwise illuminate aspects of disease initiation and progression, leading to the ultimate identification of potential therapeutics. The establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a human cellular model with defined genetics has provided the unique opportunity to study rare diseases within a controlled environment. iPSC models enable researchers to define mutational effects on specific cell types and signaling pathways within increasingly complex systems. Among rare diseases, pediatric diseases affecting neurodevelopment and neurological function highlight the critical need for iPSC-based disease modeling due to the inherent difficulty associated with collecting human neural tissue and the complexity of the mammalian nervous system. Rare neurodevelopmental disorders are therefore ideal candidates for utilization of iPSC-based in vitro studies. In this review, we address both the state of the iPSC field in the context of their utility and limitations for neurodevelopmental studies, as well as speculating about the future applications and unmet uses for iPSCs in rare diseases.",Jordan N Sheets;Kevin R Francis
113,V P Nikitin,"According to a common perspective, amnesia is a passive consequence of memory consolidation or reconsolidation impairment. The results of our own study, as well as literature data, allowed us to offer an interpretation of amnesia. Amnesia is an active process whose key characteristics are similar to those of other long-term plastic rearrangements of the brain, including learning processes. In accordance with this hypothesis, the review considers the data we obtained on the mechanisms of amnesia induction and development caused by impairment of conditioned food aversion memory consolidation or reconsolidation. In particular, experimental data indicating the dependence of amnesia induction on protein and RNA syntheses are described. After amnesia induction, a time-dependent reorganization of its processes is shown to occur. In early amnesia stages (< 10 days), a gradual decrease in the possibility of memory formation during a second training was observed. In late stages of amnesia (10 days or more), an unusual physiological phenomenon was revealed-the second training did not lead to the formation of long-term memory. This effect was specific, as memory for a new type of food could possibly be formed in these animals. The described properties of amnesia facilitate its characterization as specific anterograde amnesia. In addition, at an early but not late amnesia stages, reminder presentation caused amnesia reactivation, impairment of which by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors caused memory recovery. The results obtained allow us to characterize amnesia as a specific, time-dependent, separate process. In conclusion, the potential biological significance of the described type of amnesia is considered, and we discuss the possible molecular mechanisms underlying it.",S V Solntseva;S A Kozyrev;P V Nikitin
114,Maria Cotelli,"The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the efficacy of language training, alone or in combination with non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, designed to improve oral and written naming abilities in Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), and to investigate whether gains can be maintained over time and generalize to untrained items. An electronic database search was conducted up to 31st of May 2019. Forty-three articles on language training alone and seven articles on the combined treatment fitted the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Results indicated that language training, alone or in combination with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), improves oral naming accuracy for trained items in patients with PPA, with a long-term maintenance of the gain over time. Only language training combined with tDCS improves oral naming accuracy for untrained items. Considering written naming abilities, language training combined with tDCS improves performance for both trained and untrained items, immediately after training and at follow-up.",Rosa Manenti;Clarissa Ferrari;Elena Gobbi;Ambra Macis;Stefano F Cappa
115,John F Kihlstrom,"Four variants on Tulving's ""Remember/Know"" paradigm supported a tripartite classification of recollective experience in recognition memory into Remembering (as in conscious recollection of a past episode), Knowing (similar to retrieval from semantic memory), and Feeling (a priming-based judgment of familiarity). Recognition-by-knowing and recognition-by-feeling are differentiated by level of processing at the time of encoding (Experiments 1-3), shifts in the criterion for item recognition (Experiment 2), response latencies (Experiments 1-3), and changes in the response window (Experiment 3). False recognition is often accompanied by ""feeling"", but rarely by ""knowing""; d' is higher for knowing than for feeling (Experiments 1-4). Recognition-by-knowing increases with additional study trials, while recognition-by-feeling falls to zero (Experiment 4). In these ways, recognition-by-knowing is distinguished from recognition-by-feeling in much the same way as, in the traditional Remember/Know paradigm, recognition-by-remembering can be distinguished from recognition-without-remembering. Implications are discussed for dual-process theories of memory, and the search for the neural substrates of memory retrieval.",
116,Janet Metcalfe,"Many recent studies have shown that memory for correct answers is enhanced when an error is committed and then corrected, as compared to when the correct answer is provided without intervening error commission. The fact that the kind of errors that produced such a benefit, in past research, were those that were semantically related to the correct answer suggested that the effect may occur because the error provides a semantic stepping stone to the correct answer: the Semantic Mediation hypothesis. This hypothesis seems at odds with the finding that amnesics, including those studied by Tulving and his colleagues-who purportedly have spared semantic/implicit memory-experience enormous difficulties when they commit errors. Accordingly, the present experiments investigated whether the error-generation benefit seen in typicals was attributable Semantic Mediation or to Episodic Recollection. In Experiment 1, we used polysemous materials to create Congruent (e.g., wrist-palm) and Incongruent (e.g., tree-palm) cues for target words (e.g., HAND). In the Congruent condition, participants generated errors that were semantically related to the target (e.g., finger), and which could have provided a semantic mediator. In the Incongruent condition they generated errors that were unrelated to the target (e.g., coconut), and which, therefore, should not have provided a semantic mediator. The Congruent and Incongruent conditions both produced an error-generation benefit-contradicting the Semantic Mediation hypothesis. Experiment 2 showed that the error-generation benefit only occurred when the original error was also recollected on the final memory test. Indeed, in the Incongruent condition, when the error was not, itself, recalled, error generation resulted in a deficit in memory for the correct response. These results point to episodic/explicit, rather than semantic/implicit memory, as the locus of the 'learning from errors' benefits.",Barbie J Huelser
117,J Domínguez-Borràs,"It is debated whether the amygdala is critical for the emotional modulation of attention. While some studies show reduced attentional benefits for emotional stimuli in amygdala-damaged patients, others report preserved emotional effects. Various factors may account for these discrepant findings, including the temporal onset of the lesion, the completeness and severity of tissue damage, or the extent of neural plasticity and compensatory mechanisms, among others. Here, we investigated a rare patient with focal acute destruction of bilateral amygdala and adjacent hippocampal structures after late-onset herpetic encephalitis in adulthood. We compared her performance in two classic visual attention paradigms with that of healthy controls. First, we tested for any emotional advantage during an attentional blink task. Whereas controls showed better report of fearful and happy than neutral faces on trials with short lags between targets, the patient showed no emotional advantage, but also globally reduced report rates for all faces. Second, to ensure that memory disturbance due to hippocampal damage would not interfere with report performance, we also used a visual search task with either emotionally or visually salient face targets. Although the patient still exhibited efficient guided search for visually salient, non-emotional faces, her search slopes for emotional versus neutral faces showed no comparable benefit. In both tasks, however, changes in the patient predominated for happy more than fear stimuli, despite her normal explicit recognition of happy expressions. Our results provide new support for a causal role of the amygdala in emotional facilitation of visual attention, especially under conditions of increasing task-demands, and not limited to negative information. In addition, our data suggest that such deficits may not be amenable to plasticity and compensation, perhaps due to sudden and late-onset damage occurring in adulthood.",M Moyne;A Saj;R Guex;P Vuilleumier
118,Sheikh F Ahmad,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a broad range of neurodevelopmental disorders that are associated with deficits in social interaction and communication. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG126 represents a promising therapeutic agent for several neuroinflammatory disorders. There are currently no treatments available that can improve ASD and we previously showed that AG126 treatment exerts beneficial effects on BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, a model for autism that shows the core features of ASD; however, the immunological mechanisms and molecular targets associated with this effect were previously unclear. This study was undertaken to delineate the neuroprotective effect of AG126 on BTBR mice. Here, using this mouse model, we investigated the effects of AG126 administration on IL-21R, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α, NOS2, STAT3, IL-27, and Foxp3 production by CD8+ T cells in the spleen by flow cytometry. We further explored the mRNA and protein expression of IL-21, IL-22, IL-1β, TNF-α, NOS2, JAK1, STAT3, IL-27, and Foxp3 in brain tissue by RT-PCR, and western blotting. We found that BTBR mice treated with AG126 exhibited significant decreases in IL-21R-, IL-21-, IL-22-, TNF-α-, NOS2-, STAT3-producing, and increases in IL-27- and Foxp3-producing, CD8+ T cells. Our results further demonstrated that AG126 treatment effectively decreased IL-21, IL-22, IL-1β, TNF-α, NOS2, JAK1, and STAT3, and increased IL-27 and Foxp3 mRNA and protein expression in brain tissues. Our findings suggest that AG126 elicits a neuroprotective response through downregulation of the IL-21/IL-21R and JAK/STAT pathway in BTBR mice, which could represent a promising novel therapeutic target for ASD treatment.",Mushtaq A Ansari;Ahmed Nadeem;Saleh A Bakheet;Sary Alsanea;Khaled A Al-Hosaini;Hafiz M Mahmood;Mohammad Z Alzahrani;Sabry M Attia
119,Suren B Bandara,"Previous studies demonstrated that pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a GABA type A receptor (GABAAR) antagonist, elicits seizure-like phenotypes in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Here, we determined whether the GABAAR antagonists, tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) and picrotoxin (PTX), both listed as credible chemical threat agents, similarly trigger seizures in zebrafish larvae. Larvae of three, routinely used laboratory zebrafish lines, Tropical 5D, NHGRI and Tupfel long fin, were exposed to varying concentrations of PTZ (used as a positive control), PTX or TETS for 20 min at 5 days post fertilization (dpf). Acute exposure to PTZ, PTX or TETS triggered seizure behavior in the absence of morbidity or mortality. While the concentration-effect relationship for seizure behavior was similar across zebrafish lines for each GABAAR antagonist, significantly less TETS was required to trigger seizures relative to PTX or PTZ. Recordings of extracellular field potentials in the optic tectum of 5 dpf Tropical 5D zebrafish confirmed that all three GABAAR antagonists elicited extracellular spiking patterns consistent with seizure activity, although the pattern varied between chemicals. Post-exposure treatment with the GABAAR positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), diazepam, midazolam or allopregnanolone, attenuated seizure behavior and activity but did not completely normalize electrical field recordings in the optic tectum. These data are consistent with observations of seizure responses in mammalian models exposed to these same GABAAR antagonists and PAMs, further validating larval zebrafish as a higher throughput-screening platform for antiseizure therapeutics, and demonstrating its appropriateness for identifying improved countermeasures for TETS and other convulsant chemical threat agents that trigger seizures via GABAAR antagonism.",Dennis R Carty;Vikrant Singh;Danielle J Harvey;Natalia Vasylieva;Brandon Pressly;Heike Wulff;Pamela J Lein
120,Rania M Salama,"The complexity of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis is attributed to multiple pathways involved in the neurodegeneration process. Among these pathways arise the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis, where inhibition of this cascade has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Crocin, a carotenoid found in saffron, has shown beneficial effects against neurodegenerative diseases via anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. However, the exact molecular pathways involved in crocin's neuroprotective effects have not been fully elucidated. This drove our attention to unravel the possible involvement of PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway in the neuroprotective effect of crocin against rotenone (ROT)-induced PD in rats. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, crocin (30 mg/kg/day; i.p.), ROT (1.5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and ROT pre-treated with crocin for 30 days. Crocin administration showed a substantial behavioral improvement. At the cellular level, crocin significantly stimulated the PI3K/Akt pathway, augmented phospho-proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa (p-PRAS40), mTOR and p-p70S6K levels. Consequently, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), forkhead box transcription factor of the O class (FoxO3a), and the downstream caspase-9 were decreased; thus, attenuating neurodegeneration, which was witnessed through increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine (DA), and hampered α-synuclein levels. Moreover, crocin showed enhanced expression of microRNA-7 (miRNA-7) and miRNA-221, which contributed to Akt/mTOR activation. These results were verified by improved histopathological portrait and increased number of intact neurons. In conclusion, crocin showed promising neuroprotective effects in ROT-induced PD via activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis and enhanced miRNA-7 and miRNA-221.",Ghada A Abdel-Latif;Samah S Abbas;Hekmat M El Magdoub;Mona F Schaalan
121,Odile Poirel,"Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1-3) mediate the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles. VGLUTs are pivotal actors of excitatory transmission and of almost all brain functions. Their implication in various pathologies has been clearly documented. Despite their functional importance, the pharmacology of VGLUTs is limited to a few dyes such as Trypan Blue, Rose Bengal or Brilliant Yellow type. Here, we report the design and evaluation of new potent analogs based on Trypan Blue scaffold. Our best compound, named LSP5-2157, has an EC50 of 50 nM on glutamate vesicular uptake. Using a 3D homology model of VGLUT1 and docking experiments, we determined its putative binding subdomains within vesicular glutamate transporters and validated the structural requirement for VGLUT inhibition. To better estimate the specificity and potency of LSP5-2157, we also investigated its ability to block glutamatergic transmission in autaptic hippocampal cells. Neither glutamate receptors nor GABAergic transmission or transmission machinery were affected by LSP5-2157. Low doses of compound reversibly reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission in hippocampal autpases. LSP5-2157 had a low and depressing effect on synaptic efficacy in hippocampal slice. Furthermore, LSP5-2157 had no effect on NMDA-R- mediated fEPSP but reduce synaptic plasticity induced by 3 trains of 100 Hz. Finally, LSP5-2157 had the capacity to inhibit VGLUT3-dependent auditory synaptic transmission in the guinea pig cochlea. In this model, it abolished the compound action potential of auditory nerve at high concentration showing the limited permeation of LSP5-2157 in an in-vivo model. In summary, the new ligand LSP5-2157, has a high affinity and specificity for VGLUTs and shows some permeability in isolated neuron, tissue preparations or in vivo in the auditory system. These findings broaden the field of VGLUTs inhibitors and open the way to their use to assess glutamatergic functions in vitro and in vivo.",Lauren E Mamer;Melissa A Herman;Marie Arnulf-Kempcke;Myriam Kervern;Brigitte Potier;Stephanie Miot;Jing Wang;Franck-Cyril Favre-Besse;Isabelle Brabet;Younès Laras;Hugues-Olivier Bertrand;Francine Acher;Jean-Philippe Pin;Jean-Luc Puel;Bruno Giros;Jacques Epelbaum;Christian Rosenmund;Patrick Dutar;Stephanie Daumas;Salah El Mestikawy;Nicolas Pietrancosta
122,Paola Alberti,"Oxaliplatin (OHP) Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity (OIPN) is one of the dose-limiting toxicities of the drug and these adverse effects limit cancer therapy with L-OHP, used for colorectal cancer treatment. Acute neurotoxicity consists of symptoms that are the hallmarks of a transient axonal hyperexcitability; chronic neurotoxicity has a clinical picture compatible with a length-dependent sensory neuropathy. Acute OIPN pathogenesis has been linked to sodium voltage-operated channels (Na + VOC) dysfunction and it has been advocated as a possible predisposing factor to chronic neurotoxicity. We tested if topiramate (TPM), a well-known Na + VOC modulator, was able to modify acute as well as chronic OIPN. The project was divided into two parts. In Experiment 1 we tested by means of Nerve Excitability Testing (NET) a cohort of female Wistar rats to assess TPM effects after a single OHP administration (5 mg/kg, iv). In Experiment 2 we assessed TPM effects after chronic OHP treatment (5 mg/kg, 2qw4ws, iv) using NET, nerve conduction studies (NCS), behavioral tests and neuropathology (caudal nerve morphometry and morphology and Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber [IENF] density). In Experiment 1 TPM was able to prevent OHP effects on Na + VOC: OHP treatment induced a highly significant reduction of the sensory nerve's threshold, during the superexcitability period (p-value = 0.008), whereas TPM co-administration prevented this effect. In Experiment 2 we verified that TPM was able to prevent not only acute phenomena, but also to completely prevent chronic OIPN. This latter observation was supported by a multimodal approach: in fact, only OHP group showed altered findings compared to CTRL group at a neurophysiological (proximal caudal nerve sensory nerve action potential [SNAP] amplitude, p-value = 0.001; distal caudal nerve SNAP amplitude, p-value<0.001, distal caudal nerve sensory conduction velocity, p-value = 0.04), behavioral (mechanical threshold, p-value 0.003) and neuropathological levels (caudal nerve fibers density, p-value 0.001; IENF density, p-value <0.001). Our data show that TPM is a promising drug to prevent both acute and chronic OIPN. These findings have a high translational potential, since they were obtained using outcome measures that match clinical practice and TPM is already approved for clinical use being free from detrimental interaction with OHP anticancer properties.",Annalisa Canta;Alessia Chiorazzi;Giulia Fumagalli;Cristina Meregalli;Laura Monza;Eleonora Pozzi;Elisa Ballarini;Virginia Rodriguez-Menendez;Norberto Oggioni;Giulio Sancini;Paola Marmiroli;Guido Cavaletti
123,R D Moreno-Fernández,"The LPA1 receptor, one of the six characterized G protein-coupled receptors (LPA1-6) through which lysophosphatidic acid acts, is likely involved in promoting normal emotional behaviours. Current data suggest that the LPA-LPA1-receptor pathway may be involved in mediating the negative consequences of stress on hippocampal function. However, to date, there is no available information regarding the mechanisms whereby the LPA1 receptor mediates this adaptation. To gain further insight into how the LPA-LPA1 pathway may prevent the negative consequences of chronic stress, we assessed the effects of the continuous delivery of LPA on depressive-like behaviours induced by a chronic restraint stress protocol. Because a proper excitatory/inhibitory balance seems to be key for controlling the stress response system, the gene expression of molecular markers of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission was also determined. In addition, the hippocampal expression of mineralocorticoid receptor genes and glucocorticoid receptor genes and proteins as well as plasma corticosterone levels were determined. Contrary to our expectations, the continuous delivery of LPA in chronically stressed animals potentiated rather than inhibited some (e.g., anhedonia, reduced latency to the first immobility period), though not all, behavioural effects of stress. Furthermore, this treatment led to an alteration in the genes coding for proteins involved in the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the ventral hippocampus and to changes in corticosterone levels. In conclusion, the results of this study reinforce the assumption that LPA is involved in emotional regulation, mainly through the LPA1 receptor, and regulates the effects of stress on hippocampal gene expression and hippocampus-dependent behaviour.",C Rosell-Valle;A Bacq;O Zanoletti;M Cifuentes;M Pérez-Martín;A L Gavito;M I García-Fernández;G Estivill-Torrús;F Rodríguez de Fonseca;L J Santín;C Sandi;C Pedraza
124,Mieke van Holstein,"Maladaptive decision making is a characteristic feature of substance use disorder and pathological gambling. Studies in humans and animals have implicated neural circuits that include the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in facilitating risk/reward decision making. However, the preclinical literature has focussed primarily on situations where animals use internally-generated information to adapt to changes in reward likelihood, whereas many real-life situations require the use of external stimuli to facilitate context-appropriate behavior. We recently developed the ""Blackjack"" task, to measure cued risk/reward decision making requiring rats to chose between Small/Certain and Large/Risky rewards, with auditory cues at the start of each trial explicitly informing that the probability of obtaining a large reward was either good (50%) or poor (12.5%). Here we investigated the contribution of the BLA and its interaction with the NAc in guiding these types of decisions. In well-trained male rats, bilateral inactivation of the BLA induced suboptimal decision making, primarily by reducing risky choice on good-odds trials. In comparison, pharmacological disconnection of the BLA and NAc-shell also induced suboptimal decision making, diverting choice from more preferred option by reducing or increasing risky choice on good vs. poor odds trials respectively. Together, these results suggest that the BLA-NAc circuitry plays a crucial role in integrating information provided by discriminative stimuli. Furthermore, this circuitry may aid in guiding action selection of advantageous options in situations to maximize rewards. Finally, they suggest that perturbations in optimal decision making observed in substance abuse and gambling disorders may be driven in part by dysfunction within this circuitry.",Paula E MacLeod;Stan B Floresco
125,Ruth Herbst,"The receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) is the key signaling molecule during the formation of a mature and functional neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Signal transduction events downstream of MuSK activation induce both pre- and postsynaptic differentiation, which, most prominently, includes the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at synaptic sites. MuSK activation requires a complex interplay between its co-receptor Lrp4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-4), the motor neuron-derived heparan-sulfate proteoglycan Agrin and the intracellular adaptor protein Dok-7. A tight regulation of MuSK kinase activity is crucial for proper NMJ development. Defects in MuSK signaling are the cause of muscle weakness as reported in congenital myasthenic syndromes and myasthenia gravis. This review focuses on recent structure-based analyses of MuSK, Agrin, Lrp4 and Dok-7 interactions and their function during MuSK activation. Conclusions about the regulation of the MuSK kinase that were derived from molecular structures will be highlighted. In addition, the role of MuSK during development and disease will be discussed.",
126,Caroline Guglielmetti,"Alterations in myelin integrity are involved in many neurological disorders and demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard method to diagnose and monitor MS patients, clinically available MRI protocols show limited specificity for myelin detection, notably in cerebral grey matter areas. Ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI has shown great promise for direct imaging of lipids and myelin sheaths, and thus holds potential to improve lesion detection. In this study, we used a sequence combining magnetization transfer (MT) with UTE (""UTE-MT"", TE ​= ​76 ​μs) and with short TE (""STE-MT"", TE ​= ​3000 ​μs) to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in brain myelin content in the cuprizone mouse model for MS on a clinical 7 ​T scanner. During demyelination, UTE-MT ratio (UTE-MTR) and STE-MT ratio (STE-MTR) values were significantly decreased in most white matter and grey matter regions. However, only UTE-MTR detected cortical changes. After remyelination in subcortical and cortical areas, UTE-MTR values remained lower than baseline values, indicating that UTE-MT, but not STE-MT, imaging detected long-lasting changes following a demyelinating event. Next, we evaluated the potential correlations between imaging values and underlying histopathological markers. The strongest correlation was observed between UTE-MTR and percent coverage of myelin basic protein (MBP) immunostaining (r2 ​= ​0.71). A significant, although lower, correlation was observed between STE-MTR and MBP (r2 ​= ​0.48), and no correlation was found between UTE-MTR or STE-MTR and gliosis immunostaining. Interestingly, correlations varied across brain substructures. Altogether, our results demonstrate that UTE-MTR values significantly correlate with myelin content as measured by histopathology, not only in white matter, but also in subcortical and cortical grey matter regions in the cuprizone mouse model for MS. Readily implemented on a clinical 7 ​T system, this approach thus holds great potential for detecting demyelinating/remyelinating events in both white and grey matter areas in humans. When applied to patients with neurological disorders, including MS patient populations, UTE-MT methods may improve the non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of brain lesions, not only during disease progression but also in response to next generation remyelinating therapies.",Tanguy Boucneau;Peng Cao;Annemie Van der Linden;Peder E Z Larson;Myriam M Chaumeil

128,Dennis M Hedderich,"Premature birth bears an increased risk for aberrant brain development concerning its structure and function. Cortical complexity (CC) expresses the fractal dimension of the brain surface and changes during neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that CC is altered after premature birth and associated with long-term cognitive development. One-hundred-and-one very premature-born adults (gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1500 g) and 111 term-born adults were assessed by structural MRI and cognitive testing at 27 years of age. CC was measured based on MRI by vertex-wise estimation of fractal dimension. Cognitive performance was measured based on Griffiths-Mental-Development-Scale (at 20 months) and Wechsler-Adult-Intelligence-Scales (at 27 years). In premature-born adults, CC was decreased bilaterally in large lateral temporal and medial parietal clusters. Decreased CC was associated with lower gestational age and birth weight. Furthermore, decreased CC in the medial parietal cortices was linked with reduced full-scale IQ of premature-born adults and mediated the association between cognitive development at 20 months and IQ in adulthood. Results demonstrate that CC is reduced in very premature-born adults in temporoparietal cortices, mediating the impact of prematurity on impaired cognitive development.

129,Joana Carvalho,"The characterization of receptive field (RF) properties is fundamental to understanding the neural basis of sensory and cognitive behaviour. The combination of non-invasive imaging, such as fMRI, with biologically inspired neural modelling has enabled the estimation of population RFs directly in humans. However, current approaches require making numerous a priori assumptions, so these cannot reveal unpredicted properties, such as fragmented RFs or subpopulations. This is a critical limitation in studies on adaptation, pathology or reorganization. Here, we introduce micro-probing (MP), a technique for fine-grained and largely assumption free characterization of multiple pRFs within a voxel. It overcomes many limitations of current approaches by enabling detection of unexpected RF shapes, properties and subpopulations, by enhancing the spatial detail with which we analyze the data. MP is based on tiny, fixed-size, Gaussian models that efficiently sample the entire visual space and create fine-grained probe maps. Subsequently, we derived population receptive fields (pRFs) from these maps. We demonstrate the scope of our method through simulations and by mapping the visual fields of healthy participants and of a patient group with highly abnormal RFs due to a congenital pathway disorder. Without using specific stimuli or adapted models, MP mapped the bilateral pRFs characteristic of observers with albinism. In healthy observers, MP revealed that voxels may capture the activity of multiple subpopulations RFs that sample distinct regions of the visual field. Thus, MP provides a versatile framework to visualize, analyze and model, without restrictions, the diverse RFs of cortical subpopulations in health and disease.",Azzurra Invernizzi;Khazar Ahmadi;Michael B Hoffmann;Remco J Renken;Frans W Cornelissen

131,Fuat Arikan,"BACKGROUND
Since the introduction of endovascular treatment for cerebral aneurysms, hospitals in which subarachnoid hemorrhage is treated show different availability and/or preferences towards both treatment modalities.


OBJECTIVES
The main aim is to evaluate the clinical and angiographic results according to the hospital's treatment preferences applied.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted based on use of the subarachnoid hemorrhage database of the Vascular Pathology Group of the Spanish Neurosurgery Society. Centers were classified into three subtypes according to an index in the relationship between endovascular and surgical treatment as: Endovascular preference, high endovascular preference, and elevated surgical preference. The clinical results and angiographic results were evaluated among the three treatment strategies.


RESULTS
From November 2004 to December 2017, 4282 SAH patients were selected for the study: 630 (14.7%) patients from centers with surgical preference, 2766 (64.6%) from centers with endovascular preference, and 886 (20.7%) from centers with high endovascular preference. The surgical preference group obtained the best angiographic results associated with a greater complete exclusion (OR 1.359; 95%CI 1.025-1.801; p=0.033). The surgical preference subgroup obtained the best outcome at discharge (65.45%), followed by high endovascular preference (61.5%) and endovascular preference (57.8%) (OR 1.359; 95%CI 1.025-1.801; p=0.033).


CONCLUSIONS
In Spain, there is significant variability in aneurysm exclusion treatment in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Surgical centers offer better results for both surgical and endovascular patients. A multidisciplinary approach and the maintenance of an elevated quality of surgical competence could be responsible for these results.",Nacho Errando;Alfonso Lagares;Darío Gándara;Andreu Gabarros;Pablo López-Ojeda;Javier Ibáñez;Marta Brell;Pedro A Gómez;Jose A Fernández-Alén;Jesús Morera;Angel Horcajadas;Vicente Vanaclocha;José L Llácer;Elena Baño-Ruiz;Jesús M Gonçalves-Estella;Ramon Torné;Jhon A Hoyos;Rosario Sarabia;Ignacio Arrese;Gregorio Rodríguez-Boto;Adolfo de la Lama;Jaime Domínguez;Rubén Martín-Láez;David Santamarta-Gómez;Pedro D Delgado-López;Luís Ley-Urzaiz;Olga Mateo;Begoña Iza;Javier Orduna-Martínez;Francisco de Asís Lorente-Muñoz;Fernando Muñoz Hernández;Jone Iglesias;J Vilalta
132,Andromachi Roussopoulou,"BACKROUND & PURPOSE
Perioperative neck hematoma (PNH) requiring re-intervention is an important complication after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). There are limited data regarding the potential risk factors associated with PNH. The aim of this prospective, multicenter study was to document the rate of PNH in symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (sCAS) patients treated with CEA within the first 14 days of cerebrovascular symptom onset and to identify possible predictors of this complication.


METHODS
Patients with non-disabling (mRS ≤ 2) acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack due to sCAS (≥70%) underwent CEA at three stroke-centers during a seven-year period. PNH requiring surgical re-intervention or transfusion during a 30-day follow-up period was determined by the attending surgeon but was also confirmed by an independent neurologist.


RESULTS
A total of 280 patients with sCAS underwent CEA within 14 days of ictus. PNH occurred in 10 cases (3.6%; 95%CI: 1.4%-5.8%). Pretreatment with therapeutic anticoagulation (TA) and history of atrial fibrillation were more prevalent in patients with PNH (20% vs. 3.1%, p= 0.047 & 30% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.05 respectively). Elapsed time between symptom onset and carotid surgery, pretreatment with dual antiplatelets, intravenous thrombolysis or prophylactic anticoagulation were not related to PNH in univariable analyses. Pretreatment with TA was independently associated with higher likelihood of PNH [OR: 10.69, 95%CI (1.74-65.72), p = 0.011] in multivariate logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders.


CONCLUSION
PNH is uncommon in patients with sCAS that are operated during the first 14 days of ictus.

133,Dimitrios M Anestis,"BACKGROUND
The Full Outline of Un-Responsiveness Score (FOURs) is a scale for clinical assessment of consciousness that was introduced to overcome disadvantages of the widely accepted Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).


OBJECTIVE
To carry out a systematic review and critical analysis of the available literature on the clinical application of FOURs and perform a comparison to GCS, in terms of reliability and predictive value.


METHODS
Initial search retrieved a total of 147 papers. After applying strict inclusion criteria and further article selection to overcome data heterogeneity, a statistical comparison of inter-rater reliability, in-hospital mortality and long-term outcome prediction between the two scales in the adult and pediatric population was done.


RESULTS
Even though FOURs is more complicated than GCS, its application remains quite simple. Its reliability, validity and predictive value have been supported by an increasing number of studies, especially in critical care. A statistically significant difference (p = .034) in predicting in-hospital mortality in adults, in favor of FOURs when compared to GCS, was found. However, whether it poses a clinically significant advantage in detecting patients' deterioration and outcome prediction, compared to other scaling systems, remains unclear.


CONCLUSIONS
Further studies are needed to discern the FOURs' clinical usefulness, especially in patients in non-critical condition, with milder disorders of consciousness.",Parmenion P Tsitsopoulos;Christos A Tsonidis;Nikolaos Foroglou
134,Li Ling,"OBJECTIVE
To quantitatively analyze distribution characteristics of sweat gland nerve fibres (SGNF) in normal Chinese individuals for obtaining a reference for early diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Skin biopsy samples were collected from 192 normal Chinese individuals and divided into six, four and two groups according to anatomic sites, age and gender, respectively. SGNF morphology was observed and SGNF density (SGNFD) was determined.


RESULTS
There was a significant difference in SGNFD among different anatomic sites, age and gender. A degressive tendency was observed from proximal to distal anatomic sites. SGNFD was the lowest in subjects in the 21-40-year-old age group, but was the highest in subjects in the >61-year-old age group. Overall, SGNFD fluctuated with age. SGNFD in males was significantly higher than that in females.


CONCLUSIONS
Distribution characteristics of SGNF in normal individuals may serve as a reference for early diagnosis of nerve fibre damage.",Yongdan Liu;Yifei Sun;Yun Cai;Ye Jiang;Longjian Chen;Long He;Jinwei Xue

Memory is an important brain function, and is impaired with brain lesions. Resection of the lesion is one solution for that, but presurgical planning (PSP) is needed to guide the surgery for maximum removal of the lesion, as well as maximum preservation of the function. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is one of the best approaches for such a purpose, but performing an fMRI study needs careful consideration of the factors which influence its results. Studies have shown that mental fatigue does have the potential to alter brain functions, and therefore this study aims to identify if mental fatigue should also be considered as a confounding factor when performing an fMRI study, particularly for clinical purposes.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Using 57 healthy young volunteers, face and word encoding tasks were performed, with half of the participants performing the memory tasks after a set of language tasks and half of them before that.


RESULTS
The results showed that mental fatigue led to increased activity in the bilateral thalamus and caudate in the face encoding task, and in the right thalamus, posterior cingulate and medial temporal lobe in word encoding. In addition, activation was declined with mental fatigue in the left lingual, precuneus, and posterior cingulate gyri in face encoding.


CONCLUSION
This study has shown the importance of the number and sequence of cognitive/mental tasks when performing an fMRI study, which could help to obtain more reliable fMRI maps in clinical applications. This finding is also important for performing research/cognitive studies using fMRI.",Razieh Alemi;Haleh Khoshkhouy Delshad;Mohammad Ali Oghabian
136,Yin Niu,"OBJECTIVE
To report the treatment and outcome of traumatic intracranial aneurysm (TICA) cases at the Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University in China.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
All patients diagnosed with TICA at our institution from January 1, 1977, to October 31, 2018, and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were included in the study. Cases were reported separately for those diagnosed before 1998 and those after 1998.


RESULTS
A total of 25 patients were included in the study. Ten were diagnosed with TICA prior to 1998. Seven of these 10 patients were treated surgically with parent artery sacrificed, including aneurysmectomy, trapping, and bypass. The mean Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score for the 7 patients with surgical treatment was 3.1. Three of the 10 patients died of severe complications, including intracranial infection, delayed bleeding, and deadly injury. After 1998, 15 patients were diagnosed with TICA. Thirteen presented with head trauma and two with iatrogenic TICA following ventricle drainage or sphenoid ridge meningioma resection. Thirteen were treated with endovascular treatment, including coil alone, glue, coil-associated glue, stent alone, stent-assisted coil embolization, one with clipping, and one with conservative treatment. The 13 patients with endovascular treatment achieved a mean GOS score of 4.5. Among the 13 patients, one died from intracranial infection, one suffered recurrence, and one had intraoperative rupture.


CONCLUSION
Although the treatment of TICA has traditionally been surgical, endovascular treatment with different techniques, such as endovascular patch, provides a valuable alternative. Currently, the flow diverter is a popular embolization device and may represent another valid treatment option for TICA.",Sheng Zhou;Jun Tang;Hongping Miao;Gang Zhu;Zhi Chen
137,Elena Pavlidis,"OBJECTIVE
To develop a standardised scheme for assessing normal and abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) features of preterm infants. To assess the interobserver agreement of this assessment scheme.


METHODS
We created a standardised EEG assessment scheme for 6 different post-menstrual age (PMA) groups using 4 EEG categories. Two experts, not involved in the development of the scheme, evaluated this on 24 infants <32 weeks gestational age (GA) using random 2 hour EEG epochs. Where disagreements were found, the features were checked and modified. Finally, the two experts independently evaluated 2 hour EEG epochs from an additional 12 infants <37 weeks GA. The percentage of agreement was calculated as the ratio of agreements to the sum of agreements plus disagreements.


RESULTS
Good agreement in all patients and EEG feature category was obtained, with a median agreement between 80% and 100% over the 4 EEG assessment categories. No difference was found in agreement rates between the normal and abnormal features (p = 0.959).


CONCLUSIONS
We developed a standard EEG assessment scheme for preterm infants that shows good interobserver agreement.


SIGNIFICANCE

138,Robert J Barry,"OBJECTIVE
Global EEG alpha activity is negatively correlated with skin conductance level (SCL), supporting alpha as an inverse marker of arousal. Frequency Principal Components Analysis (f-PCA) of resting EEG amplitude spectra has demonstrated natural components in the alpha band of healthy persons. This is a preliminary exploration of whether such components differ with arousal, possibly underpinning the anomalous ADHD hypoarousal link to reduced alpha.


METHOD
Twenty-seven right-handed undergraduate students participated in three 2 minute blocks of resting eyes-open/closed EEG and SCL: EO1, EC, EO2. For each condition, mean EEG spectra were submitted to separate f-PCAs.


RESULTS
The inverse alpha/SCL relationship was confirmed for band amplitudes. EO had two alpha components; both correlated negatively with SCL. EC alpha contained four components, but only one had a substantial negative correlation with SCL; two had no relationship, suggesting natural alpha components with different non-arousal functionality in EC.


CONCLUSION
Some alpha components in both EC and EO reflect arousal, with other non-arousal components in EC. Our f-PCA approach offers insight into previously-noted alpha anomalies in disorders such as ADHD.


SIGNIFICANCE
This proof of concept demonstration in typical participants may provide the basis for a new research effort in clinical disorders involving atypical arousal patterns.",Frances M De Blasio;Jack S Fogarty;Adam R Clarke
139,Olga V Sysoeva,"OBJECTIVE
Systematically review the abnormalities in event related potential (ERP) recorded in Rett Syndrome (RTT) patients and animals in search of translational biomarkers of deficits related to the particular neurophysiological processes of known genetic origin (MECP2 mutations).


METHODS
Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge and BIORXIV were searched for the relevant articles according to PRISMA standards.


RESULTS
ERP components are generally delayed across all sensory modalities both in RTT patients and its animal model, while findings on ERPs amplitude strongly depend on stimulus properties and presentation rate. Studies on RTT animal models uncovered the abnormalities in the excitatory and inhibitory transmission as critical mechanisms underlying the ERPs changes, but showed that even similar ERP alterations in auditory and visual domains have a diverse neural basis. A range of novel approaches has been developed in animal studies bringing along the meaningful neurophysiological interpretation of ERP measures in RTT patients.


CONCLUSIONS
While there is a clear evidence for sensory ERPs abnormalities in RTT, to further advance the field there is a need in a large-scale ERP studies with the functionally-relevant experimental paradigms.


SIGNIFICANCE
The review provides insights into domain-specific neural basis of the ERP abnormalities and promotes clinical application of the ERP measures as the non-invasive functional biomarkers of RTT pathophysiology.",Kirill Smirnov;Tatiana A Stroganova
140,Chad A Purnell,"OBJECTIVE
Up to 10% of midline nasal dermoid cysts have intracranial extension. Previous techniques of excision include frontal and frontonasal craniotomies via a coronal approach, combined with a direct cutaneous excision of the dermoid cyst. While the coronal incision allows for wide visualization, it carries significant risks of transfusion, blood loss, and scarring. The authors present an alternative technique in which access is gained through a midline extension of the dermoid cyst excision that provides direct access for a keyhole frontal craniotomy.


METHODS
The authors utilize a nasal bone osteotomy, pericranial flap, and keyhole-type craniotomy performed through a nasal midline incision for the treatment of nasal dermoid cysts with intracranial extension. They performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with nasal dermoid cysts treated at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago from 2009 to 2017. Patient demographic data, operative data, and in- and outpatient complication data were collected.


RESULTS
In 10 patients with cyst extension near or into the intracranial cavity (7 with true intracranial extension), the nasal osteotomy technique was performed. The mean blood loss was 13 ml, with a 0% transfusion rate. The mean length of inpatient stay was 1 day. A durotomy was made and repaired as part of the dermoid cyst dissection in 3 patients. One patient underwent intraoperative placement of a lumbar drain. The mean operative time was 228 minutes. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications, including the need for a reoperation. No patients had any long-term complications, and no patients have had dermoid cyst recurrence. The appearance of the scar was acceptable in all cases.


CONCLUSIONS
The midline approach to nasal dermoid cysts with intracranial extension is safe and results in limited blood loss, short operative times, and short lengths of inpatient hospital stay. This is a viable technique for the treatment of this challenging pathology.",Rachel Skladman;Tord D Alden;Julia F Corcoran;Jeffrey C Rastatter
141,Andrew M Heitzer,"OBJECTIVE
High survival rates have led to an increased emphasis on the functional outcomes of children diagnosed with low-grade glioma. Most outcomes research has focused on risks associated with radiotherapy, but less is known about neuropsychological risks for patients treated with surgery alone. Here, the authors sought to examine the neuropsychological trajectories of children diagnosed with a low-grade glioma and monitored up to 6 years postsurgery. Secondarily, they explored demographic and clinical predictors of neuropsychological performance.


METHODS
The neuropsychological functioning of 32 patients (median age at diagnosis 10.0 years) was prospectively assessed annually for up to 6 years after surgery (median days from surgery at baseline = 72). Tumor location was predominately supratentorial (65.6%). A combination of performance-based and parent-reported measures was used to assess intelligence, memory, executive functioning, and fine motor control in all patients.


RESULTS
Binomial tests at the postoperative baseline revealed that the proportion of children falling below the average range (< 16th percentile) was significantly higher than the rate expected among healthy peers on measures of verbal memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and fine motor control (p < 0.05). Even so, linear mixed models indicated that neuropsychological functioning at the postoperative baseline did not significantly change over time for up to 6 years after surgery across all domains. A larger tumor size was associated with a slower reaction time (p < 0.01). A supratentorial tumor location and history of seizures were associated with more parent-reported executive difficulties (p < 0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
While radiotherapy is a known risk factor for neuropsychological deficits in pediatric brain tumor patients, findings in this study indicate that children treated for low-grade glioma with surgery alone (without radiotherapy or chemotherapy) remain susceptible to difficulties with memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning that persist over time. Over half of the children in the study sample required school support services to address neuropsychological weaknesses. Although low-grade glioma is often conceptualized as a benign tumor, children treated for this lesion require ongoing monitoring and intervention to address neuropsychological weaknesses resulting from the tumor itself as well as the surgery.",Kimberly Raghubar;M Douglas Ris;Charles G Minard;Marsha N Gragert;Heather H Stancel;Jessica Orobio;Judy Xue;William Whitehead;M Fatih Okcu;Murali Chintagumpala;Lisa S Kahalley
142,Kyle P O'Connor,"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is the most common surgical procedure utilized for degenerative diseases of the cervical spine. The authors present the case of a 64-year-old man who underwent an ACDF for degenerative changes causing cervical stenosis with myelopathy. The patient's symptoms consisted of pain and weakness of the bilateral upper extremities that slowly progressed over 1.5 years. During the procedure, the superior horn of the thyroid cartilage impeded proper retraction, preventing adequate visualization due to its prominent size. At this point, otorhinolaryngology was consulted, which allowed for safe resection of this portion of the thyroid cartilage while preserving nearby critical structures. With the frequent usage of this surgical approach for various etiologies, the importance of proper recognition and consultation is paramount.

143,Ignacio J Barrenechea,"Surgery of the cervical spine under conscious sedation has been rarely reported in the literature. The main indications are the lack of neurophysiological monitoring and surgery in patients with high cardiovascular risk. To date, no reports of awake C1-2 instrumentation have been published in the English-language literature. The authors present the case of a 76-year-old patient with multiple myeloma and severe cardiomyopathy associated with primary amyloidosis who experienced severe myelopathy from a C2 pseudotumor associated with an odontoid fracture. Due to his high cardiovascular risk, the patient underwent C1 decompression and C1-2 instrumentation and fusion via an awake technique. To accomplish this task, the authors performed multilayered muscular infiltration of local anesthetics and avoided manipulating the C2 root by anchoring C1 with a rod-claw system. The procedure did not last longer than that of general anesthetic approaches, and no complaints were reported by the patient during surgery, which he described as an overall ""good experience."" The patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day and resumed his previous work 3 months later. Performing surgery under local anesthesia and conscious sedation reduces the risk of perioperative cardiovascular and respiratory complications in these high-risk patients by avoiding the use of drugs with cardiodepressant effects and endotracheal intubation.",Luis Márquez;Héctor P Rojas;Marco Nicola;Carlos Dumont
144,Jonathan Shapey,"OBJECTIVE
Automatic segmentation of vestibular schwannomas (VSs) from MRI could significantly improve clinical workflow and assist in patient management. Accurate tumor segmentation and volumetric measurements provide the best indicators to detect subtle VS growth, but current techniques are labor intensive and dedicated software is not readily available within the clinical setting. The authors aim to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework to be embedded in the clinical routine for automatic delineation and volumetry of VS.


METHODS
Imaging data (contrast-enhanced T1-weighted [ceT1] and high-resolution T2-weighted [hrT2] MR images) from all patients meeting the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria who had a single sporadic VS treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery were used to create a model. The authors developed a novel AI framework based on a 2.5D convolutional neural network (CNN) to exploit the different in-plane and through-plane resolutions encountered in standard clinical imaging protocols. They used a computational attention module to enable the CNN to focus on the small VS target and propose a supervision on the attention map for more accurate segmentation. The manually segmented target tumor volume (also tested for interobserver variability) was used as the ground truth for training and evaluation of the CNN. We quantitatively measured the Dice score, average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and relative volume error (RVE) of the automatic segmentation results in comparison to manual segmentations to assess the model's accuracy.


RESULTS
Imaging data from all eligible patients (n = 243) were randomly split into 3 nonoverlapping groups for training (n = 177), hyperparameter tuning (n = 20), and testing (n = 46). Dice, ASSD, and RVE scores were measured on the testing set for the respective input data types as follows: ceT1 93.43%, 0.203 mm, 6.96%; hrT2 88.25%, 0.416 mm, 9.77%; combined ceT1/hrT2 93.68%, 0.199 mm, 7.03%. Given a margin of 5% for the Dice score, the automated method was shown to achieve statistically equivalent performance in comparison to an annotator using ceT1 images alone (p = 4e-13) and combined ceT1/hrT2 images (p = 7e-18) as inputs.


CONCLUSIONS
The authors developed a robust AI framework for automatically delineating and calculating VS tumor volume and have achieved excellent results, equivalent to those achieved by an independent human annotator. This promising AI technology has the potential to improve the management of patients with VS and potentially other brain tumors.",Guotai Wang;Reuben Dorent;Alexis Dimitriadis;Wenqi Li;Ian Paddick;Neil Kitchen;Sotirios Bisdas;Shakeel R Saeed;Sebastien Ourselin;Robert Bradford;Tom Vercauteren
145,Shawyon Baygani,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study is to determine if the preoperative Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) score is predictive of short- and intermediate-term PedsQL outcomes following Chiari decompression surgery. The utility of preoperative patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in predicting pain, opioid consumption, and long-term PROs has been demonstrated in adult spine surgery. To the best of the authors' knowledge, however, there is currently no widely accepted tool to predict short-, intermediate-, or long-term outcomes after pediatric Chiari decompression surgery.


METHODS
A prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had undergone first-time decompression for symptomatic Chiari malformation were identified and grouped according to their preoperative PedsQL scores: mild disability (score 80-100), moderate disability (score 60-79), and severe disability (score < 60). PedsQL scores at the 6-week, 3-month, and/or 6-month follow-ups were collected. Preoperative PedsQL subgroups were tested for an association with demographic and perioperative characteristics using one-way ANOVA or chi-square analysis. Preoperative PedsQL subgroups were tested for an association with improvements in short- and intermediate-term PedsQL scores using one-way ANOVA and a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test controlling for statistically different demographic characteristics when appropriate.


RESULTS
A total of 87 patients were included in this analysis. According to their preoperative PedsQL scores, 28% of patients had mild disability, 40% had moderate disability, and 32% had severe disability. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of comorbidities (p = 0.009) and the presenting symptoms of headaches (p = 0.032) and myelopathy (p = 0.047) among the subgroups; however, in terms of other demographic or operative factors, there was no significant difference. Patients with greater preoperative disability demonstrated statistically significantly lower PedsQL scores at all postoperative time points, except in terms of the parent-reported PedsQL at 6 months after surgery (p = 0.195). Patients with severe disability demonstrated statistically significantly greater improvements (compared to preoperative scores) in PedsQL scores at all time points after surgery, except in terms of the 6-week and 6-month PROs and the 6-month parent-reported outcomes (p = 0.068, 0.483, and 0.076, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Patients with severe disability, as assessed by the PedsQL, had lower absolute PedsQL scores at all time points after surgery but greater improvement in short- and intermediate-term PROs. The authors conclude that the PedsQL is an efficient and accurate tool that can quickly assess patient disability in the preoperative period and predict both short- and intermediate-term surgical outcomes.",Kristin Zieles;Andrew Jea
146,Kubilay Aydin,"OBJECTIVE
The endovascular treatment of complex bifurcation aneurysms possessing a neck that incorporates multiple side branches remains a surgical challenge. Double-stent-assisted coiling techniques, such as those with stents in an X and Y configuration, enable the endovascular treatment of wide-necked complex intracranial bifurcation aneurysms. However, the intraluminal struts at the intersection point in X- and Y-stents are not amenable to endothelialization, which may lead to thromboembolic complications. Stenting in the T configuration is a relatively new double-stent coiling technique. T-stenting differs from X- or Y-stenting in that there are no overlapping or intersecting stent segments. Promising short-term results of T-stent-assisted coiling were recently reported. However, the long-term results have not yet been demonstrated. This retrospective study investigated the long-term angiographic and clinical results in patients with wide-necked complex intracranial bifurcation aneurysms treated with T-stent-assisted coiling.


METHODS
A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with wide-necked complex intracranial bifurcation aneurysms treated with T-stent-assisted coiling at 4 institutions. The technical success and the initial and follow-up clinical and angiographic outcomes were assessed. Aneurysm filling status was assessed according to the Raymond classification. Periprocedural and delayed complications were reviewed. The neurological status of the patients was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).


RESULTS
One hundred two aneurysms in 102 patients (54 females), whose mean age was 57.9 ± 13.0 years, were included in the study. T-stenting was performed successfully in all patients. Immediate postprocedural angiography revealed complete occlusion in 83.3% of patients. Periprocedural complications developed in 13.7%, resulting in permanent morbidity in 1.9% and death in 1%. Eighty patients (78.4%) had at least one follow-up DSA examination performed at 6 months or later following the endovascular procedure. The mean duration of angiographic follow-up was 30.0 ± 16.3 months. The last follow-up examinations showed complete occlusion in 90.0% of patients. During the follow-up period, only 1 patient (1.3%) required retreatment. Delayed thromboembolic complications were observed in 4 patients (3.9%) without permanent morbidity. The mRS scores of all patients at the last clinical follow-up were between 0 and 2.


CONCLUSIONS
The short-term angiographic findings showed that T-stent-assisted coiling is a feasible and effective endovascular method to treat wide-necked complex bifurcation aneurysms. The long-term angiographic follow-up results suggest that T-stent-assisted coiling provides a durable treatment for wide-necked complex bifurcation aneurysms with favorable clinical outcomes, demonstrating the long-term safety of T-stent-assisted coiling.",Christian Paul Stracke;Mehmet Barburoglu;Elif Yamac;Mynzhylky Berdikhojayev;Serra Sencer;René Chapot

Clinical evidence on giant intracranial aneurysms (GIAs), intracranial aneurysms with a diameter of at least 25 mm, is limited. The authors aimed to investigate the natural history, case fatality, and treatment outcomes of ruptured and unruptured GIAs.


METHODS
In this international observational registry study, patients with a ruptured or unruptured GIA received conservative management (CM), surgical management (SM), or endovascular management (EM). The authors investigated rupture rates and case fatality.


RESULTS
The retrospective cohort comprised 219 patients with GIAs (21.9% ruptured GIAs and 78.1% unruptured GIAs) whose index hospitalization occurred between January 2006 and November 2016. The index hospitalization in the prospective cohort (362 patients with GIAs [17.1% ruptured and 82.9% unruptured]) occurred between December 2008 and February 2017. In the retrospective cohort, the risk ratio for death at a mean follow-up of 4.8 years (SD 2.2 years) after CM, compared with EM and SM, was 1.63 (95% CI 1.23-2.16) in ruptured GIAs and 3.96 (95% CI 2.57-6.11) in unruptured GIAs. In the prospective cohort, the 1-year case fatality in ruptured GIAs/unruptured GIAs was 100%/22.0% during CM, 36.0%/3.0% after SM, and 39.0%/12.0% after EM. Corresponding 1-year rupture rates in unruptured GIAs were 25.0% during CM, 1.2% after SM, and 2.5% after EM. In unruptured GIAs, the HR for death within the 1st year in patients with posterior circulation GIAs was 6.7 (95% CI 1.5-30.4, p < 0.01), with patients with a GIA at the supraclinoid internal carotid artery as reference. Different sizes of unruptured GIAs were not associated with 1-year case fatality.


CONCLUSIONS
Rupture rates for unruptured GIAs were high, and the natural history and treatment outcomes for ruptured GIAs were poor. Patients undergoing SM or EM showed lower case fatality and rupture rates than those undergoing CM. This difference in outcome may in part be influenced by patients in the CM group having been found poor candidates for SM or EM.Clinical trial registration no.: NCT02066493 (clinicaltrials.gov).",Daniel Rüfenacht;Bernhard Meyer;Veit Rohde;Matthias Endres;Pavlina Lenga;Konstantin Uttinger;Viktoria Rücker;Maria Wostrack;Adisa Kursumovic;Bujung Hong;Dorothee Mielke;Nils Ole Schmidt;Jan-Karl Burkhardt;Philippe Bijlenga;Edoardo Boccardi;Christophe Cognard;Peter U Heuschmann;Peter Vajkoczy
148,Praveen V Mummaneni,"OBJECTIVE
Discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility or another acute-care facility not only constitutes a postoperative challenge for patients and their care team but also contributes significantly to healthcare costs. In this era of changing dynamics of healthcare payment models in which cost overruns are being increasingly shifted to surgeons and hospitals, it is important to better understand outcomes such as discharge disposition. In the current article, the authors sought to develop a predictive model for factors associated with nonroutine discharge after surgery for grade I spondylolisthesis.


METHODS
The authors queried the Quality Outcomes Database for patients with grade I lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis who underwent a surgical intervention between July 2014 and June 2016. Only those patients enrolled in a multisite study investigating the impact of fusion on clinical and patient-reported outcomes among patients with grade I spondylolisthesis were evaluated. Nonroutine discharge was defined as those who were discharged to a postacute or nonacute-care setting in the same hospital or transferred to another acute-care facility.


RESULTS
Of the 608 patients eligible for inclusion, 9.4% (n = 57) had a nonroutine discharge (8.7%, n = 53 discharged to inpatient postacute or nonacute care in the same hospital and 0.7%, n = 4 transferred to another acute-care facility). Compared to patients who were discharged to home, patients who had a nonroutine discharge were more likely to have diabetes (26.3%, n = 15 vs 15.7%, n = 86, p = 0.039); impaired ambulation (26.3%, n = 15 vs 10.2%, n = 56, p < 0.001); higher Oswestry Disability Index at baseline (51 [IQR 42-62.12] vs 46 [IQR 34.4-58], p = 0.014); lower EuroQol-5D scores (0.437 [IQR 0.308-0.708] vs 0.597 [IQR 0.358-0.708], p = 0.010); higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score (3 or 4: 63.2%, n = 36 vs 36.7%, n = 201, p = 0.002); and longer length of stay (4 days [IQR 3-5] vs 2 days [IQR 1-3], p < 0.001); and were more likely to suffer a complication (14%, n = 8 vs 5.6%, n = 31, p = 0.014). On multivariable logistic regression, factors found to be independently associated with higher odds of nonroutine discharge included older age (interquartile OR 9.14, 95% CI 3.79-22.1, p < 0.001), higher body mass index (interquartile OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.31-3.25, p < 0.001), presence of depression (OR 4.28, 95% CI 1.96-9.35, p < 0.001), fusion surgery compared with decompression alone (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, p < 0.001), and any complication (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-10.9, p < 0.001).

149,Adham M Khalafallah,"OBJECTIVE
Previous authors have investigated many factors that predict an academic neurosurgical career over private practice, including attainment of a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and number of publications. Research has yet to demonstrate whether a master's degree predicts an academic neurosurgical career. This study quantifies the association between obtaining a Master of Science (MS), Master of Public Health (MPH), or Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree and pursuing a career in academic neurosurgery.


METHODS
Public data on neurosurgeons who had graduated from Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited residency programs in the period from 1949 to 2019 were collected from residency and professional websites. Residency graduates with a PhD were excluded to isolate the effect of only having a master's degree. A position was considered ""academic"" if it was affiliated with a hospital that had a neurosurgery residency program; other positions were considered nonacademic. Bivariate analyses were performed with Fisher's exact test. Multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model.


RESULTS
Within our database of neurosurgery residency alumni, there were 47 (4.1%) who held an MS degree, 31 (2.7%) who held an MPH, and 10 (0.9%) who held an MBA. In bivariate analyses, neurosurgeons with MS degrees were significantly more likely to pursue academic careers (OR 2.65, p = 0.0014, 95% CI 1.40-5.20), whereas neurosurgeons with an MPH (OR 1.41, p = 0.36, 95% CI 0.64-3.08) or an MBA (OR 1.00, p = 1.00, 95% CI 0.21-4.26) were not. In the multivariate analysis, an MS degree was independently associated with an academic career (OR 2.48, p = 0.0079, 95% CI 1.28-4.93). Moreover, postresidency h indices of 1 (OR 1.44, p = 0.048, 95% CI 1.00-2.07), 2-3 (OR 2.76, p = 2.01 × 10-8, 95% CI 1.94-3.94), and ≥ 4 (OR 4.88, p < 2.00 × 10-16, 95% CI 3.43-6.99) were all significantly associated with increased odds of pursuing an academic career. Notably, having between 1 and 11 months of protected research time was significantly associated with decreased odds of pursuing academic neurosurgery (OR 0.46, p = 0.049, 95% CI 0.21-0.98).


CONCLUSIONS
Neurosurgery residency graduates with MS degrees are more likely to pursue academic neurosurgical careers relative to their non-MS counterparts. Such findings may be used to help predict residency graduates' future potential in academic neurosurgery.",Adrian E Jimenez;Rafael J Tamargo;Timothy Witham;Judy Huang;Henry Brem;Debraj Mukherjee
150,Daniel G Eichberg,"OBJECTIVE
In some centers where brain tumor surgery is performed, the opportunity for expert intraoperative neuropathology consultation is lacking. Consequently, surgeons may not have access to the highest quality diagnostic histological data to inform surgical decision-making. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) is a novel technology that allows for rapid acquisition of diagnostic histological images at the bedside.


METHODS
The authors performed a prospective blinded cohort study of 82 consecutive patients undergoing resection of CNS tumors to compare diagnostic time and accuracy of SRH simulation to the gold standard, i.e., frozen and permanent section diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by concordance of SRH-simulated intraoperative pathology consultation with a blinded board-certified neuropathologist, with official frozen section and permanent section results.


RESULTS
Overall, the mean time to diagnosis was 30.5 ± 13.2 minutes faster (p < 0.0001) for SRH simulation than for frozen section, with similar diagnostic correlation: 91.5% (κ = 0.834, p < 0.0001) between SRH simulation and permanent section, and 91.5% between frozen and permanent section (κ = 0.894, p < 0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS
SRH-simulated intraoperative pathology consultation was significantly faster and equally accurate as frozen section.",Ashish H Shah;Long Di;Alexa M Semonche;George Jimsheleishvili;Evan M Luther;Christopher A Sarkiss;Allan D Levi;Sakir H Gultekin;Ricardo J Komotar;Michael E Ivan
151,William B Harris,"OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to perform an individual participant data meta-analysis to identify preoperative factors associated with a good seizure outcome in children with Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) undergoing resective or hemispheric epilepsy surgery.


METHODS
Electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL) were searched with no language or date restrictions to identify cohort studies of consecutive participants undergoing resective surgery that reported seizure outcomes. The authors recorded all preoperative factors that could plausibly be associated with seizure outcomes and used Cox regression analysis to identify which of these variables were associated with seizure freedom (i.e., Engel class I).


RESULTS
Of 720 citations, 19 articles reporting on 187 participants were eligible. Seizure freedom (Engel class I) was observed in 113 participants (60.4%). On univariate analyses, younger age at disease onset (hazard ratio [HR] 0.906, p = 0.001), younger age at surgery (HR 0.928, p < 0.001), shorter time to surgery (HR 0.921, p = 0.001), and hemispherectomy (HR 0.283, p < 0.001) were all associated with longer time to postoperative seizure recurrence. Additionally, multivariable analysis including the aforementioned variables showed that younger age at surgery (HR 0.946, p = 0.043) and hemispherectomy (HR 0.297, p < 0.001) were independently and significantly associated with a greater time to seizure recurrence and longer duration of seizure freedom.


CONCLUSIONS
The majority of pediatric patients undergoing resective or hemispheric surgery for RE achieve good seizure outcome. Although small retrospective cohort studies are inherently prone to bias, the best available evidence utilizing individual participant data suggests hemispheric surgery and younger age at surgery are associated with good seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery. Large, multicenter observational studies with long-term follow-up are required to evaluate the risk factors identified in this review.",H Westley Phillips;Jia Shu Chen;Alexander G Weil;George M Ibrahim;Aria Fallah
152,Dana L Cruz,"OBJECTIVE
Neck and back pain are highly prevalent conditions that account for major disability. The Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) are the two most common functional status measures for neck and back pain. However, no single instrument exists to evaluate patients with concurrent neck and back pain. The recently developed Total Disability Index (TDI) combines overlapping elements from the ODI and NDI with the unique items from each. This study aimed to prospectively validate the TDI in patients with spinal deformity, back pain, and/or neck pain.


METHODS
This study is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from a single center. The 14-item TDI, derived from ODI and NDI domains, was administered to consecutive patients presenting to a spine practice. Patients were assessed using the ODI, NDI, and EQ-5D. Validation of internal consistency, test-retest reproducibility, and validity of reconstructed NDI and ODI scores derived from TDI were assessed.


RESULTS
A total of 252 patients (mean age 55 years, 56% female) completed initial assessments (back pain, n = 115; neck pain, n = 52; back and neck pain, n = 55; spinal deformity, n = 55; and no pain/deformity, n = 29). Of these patients, 155 completed retests within 14 days. Patients represented a wide range of disability (mean ODI score: 36.3 ± 21.6; NDI score: 30.8 ± 21.8; and TDI score: 34.1 ± 20.0). TDI demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.922) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96). Differences between actual and reconstructed scores were not clinically significant. Subanalyses demonstrated TDI's ability to quantify the degree of disability due to back or neck pain in patients complaining of pain in both regions.


CONCLUSIONS
The TDI is a valid and reliable disability measure in patients with back and/or neck pain and can capture each spine region's contribution to total disability. The TDI could be a valuable method for total spine assessment in a clinical setting, and its completion is less time consuming than that for both the ODI and NDI.",Ethan W Ayres;Matthew A Spiegel;Louis M Day;Robert A Hart;Christopher P Ames;Douglas C Burton;Justin S Smith;Christopher I Shaffrey;Frank J Schwab;Thomas J Errico;Shay Bess;Virginie Lafage;Themistocles S Protopsaltis
153,Ignazio G Vetrano,"OBJECTIVE
Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) include mainly schwannomas-the most common tumors arising from peripheral nerves-and neurofibromas. Due to their origin, distinguishing between functional intact nerve and the fibers from whence the PNST arose may not always be easy to perform. The introduction of intraoperative tools to better visualize these tumors could be helpful in achieving a gross-total resection. In this study, the authors present a series of patients harboring PNST in which the surgery was performed under fluorescein guidance.


METHODS
Between September 2018 and February 2019, 20 consecutive patients with a total of 25 suspected PNSTs underwent fluorescein-guided surgery performed under microscopic view with a dedicated filter integrated into the surgical microscope (YELLOW 560) and with intraoperative monitoring. All patients presented with a different degree of contrast enhancement at preoperative MRI. Fluorescein was intravenously injected after intubation at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Preoperative clinical and radiological data, intraoperative fluorescein characteristics, and postoperative neurological and radiological outcomes were collected and analyzed.


RESULTS
Six patients were affected by neurofibromatosis or schwannomatosis. There were 14 schwannomas, 8 neurofibromas, 1 myxoma, 1 reactive follicular hyperplasia, and 1 giant cell tumor of tendon sheath. No patient experienced worsening of neurological status after surgery. No side effects related to fluorescein injection were found in this series. Fluorescein allowed an optimal intraoperative distinction between tumor and surrounding nerves in 13 of 14 schwannomas and in all neurofibromas. In 6 neurofibromas and in 1 schwannoma, the final YELLOW 560 visualization showed the presence of small tumor remnants that were not visible under white-light illumination and that could be removed, obtaining a gross-total resection.


CONCLUSIONS
Fluorescein was demonstrated to be a feasible, safe, and helpful intraoperative adjunct to better identify and distinguish PNSTs from intact functional nerves, with a possible impact on tumor resection, particularly in diffuse neurofibromas.",Francesco Acerbi;Jacopo Falco;Grazia Devigili;Sara Rinaldo;Giuseppe Messina;Francesco Prada;Antonio D'Ammando;Vittoria Nazzi
154,R Loch Macdonald,"OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to measure the concentration of nimodipine in CSF and plasma after intraventricular injection of a sustained-release formulation of nimodipine (EG-1962) in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).


METHODS
Patients with SAH repaired by clip placement or coil embolization were randomized to EG-1962 or oral nimodipine. Patients were classified as grade 2-4 on the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale for SAH and had an external ventricular drain inserted as part of their standard of care. Cohorts of 12 patients received 100-1200 mg of EG-1962 as a single intraventricular injection (9 per cohort) or they remained on oral nimodipine (3 per cohort). Plasma and CSF were collected from each patient for measurement of nimodipine concentrations and calculation of maximum plasma and CSF concentration, area under the concentration-time curve from day 0 to 14, and steady-state concentration.


RESULTS
Fifty-four patients in North America were randomized to EG-1962 and 18 to oral nimodipine. Plasma concentrations increased with escalating doses of EG-1962, remained stable for 14 to 21 days, and were detectable at day 30. Plasma concentrations in the oral nimodipine group were more variable than for EG-1962 and were approximately equal to those occurring at the EG-1962 800-mg dose. CSF concentrations of nimodipine in the EG-1962 groups were 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than in the oral nimodipine group, in which nimodipine was only detected at low concentrations in 10% (21/213) of samples. In the EG-1962 groups, CSF nimodipine concentrations were 1000 times higher than plasma concentrations.


CONCLUSIONS
Plasma concentrations of nimodipine similar to those achieved with oral nimodipine and lasting for 21 days could be achieved after a single intraventricular injection of EG-1962. The CSF concentrations from EG-1962, however, were at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than those with oral nimodipine. These results supported a phase 3 study that demonstrated a favorable safety profile for EG-1962 but yielded inconclusive efficacy results due to notable differences in clinical outcome based on baseline disease severity.Clinical trial registration no.: NCT01893190 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",Daniel Hänggi;Poul Strange;Hans Jakob Steiger;J Mocco;Michael Miller;Stephan A Mayer;Brian L Hoh;Herbert J Faleck;Nima Etminan;Michael N Diringer;Andrew P Carlson;Francois Aldrich; 
155,Wenjing Zhang,"Abnormal neuroanatomic brain networks have been reported in schizophrenia, but their characterization across patients with psychotic disorders, and their potential alterations in nonpsychotic relatives, remain to be clarified. Participants recruited by the Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes consortium included 326 probands with psychotic disorders (107 with schizophrenia (SZ), 87 with schizoaffective disorder (SAD), 132 with psychotic bipolar disorder (BD)), 315 of their nonpsychotic first-degree relatives and 202 healthy controls. Single-subject gray matter graphs were extracted from structural MRI scans, and whole-brain neuroanatomic organization was compared across the participant groups. Compared with healthy controls, psychotic probands showed decreased nodal efficiency mainly in bilateral superior temporal regions. These regions had altered morphological relationships primarily with frontal lobe regions, and their network-level alterations were associated with positive symptoms of psychosis. Nonpsychotic relatives showed lower nodal centrality metrics in the prefrontal cortex and subcortical regions, and higher nodal centrality metrics in the left cingulate cortex and left thalamus. Diagnosis-specific analysis indicated that individuals with SZ had lower nodal efficiency in bilateral superior temporal regions than controls, probands with SAD only exhibited lower nodal efficiency in the left superior and middle temporal gyrus, and individuals with psychotic BD did not show significant differences from healthy controls. Our findings provide novel evidence of clinically relevant disruptions in the anatomic association of the superior temporal lobe with other regions of whole-brain networks in patients with psychotic disorders, but not in their unaffected relatives, suggesting that it is a disease-related trait. Network disorganization primarily involving frontal lobe and subcortical regions in nonpsychotic relatives may be related to familial illness risk.",Du Lei;Sarah K Keedy;Elena I Ivleva;Seenae Eum;Li Yao;Carol A Tamminga;Brett A Clementz;Matcheri S Keshavan;Godfrey D Pearlson;Elliot S Gershon;Jeffrey R Bishop;Qiyong Gong;Su Lui;John A Sweeney
156,Antony D Abraham,"Chronic pain affects a significant percentage of the United States population, and available pain medications like opioids have drawbacks that make long-term use untenable. Cannabinoids show promise in the management of pain, but long-term treatment of pain with cannabinoids has been challenging to implement in preclinical models. We developed a voluntary, gelatin oral self-administration paradigm that allowed male and female mice to consume ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, or morphine ad libitum. Mice stably consumed these gelatins over 3 weeks, with detectable serum levels. Using a real-time gelatin measurement system, we observed that mice consumed gelatin throughout the light and dark cycles, with animals consuming less THC-gelatin than the other gelatin groups. Consumption of all three gelatins reduced measures of allodynia in a chronic, neuropathic sciatic nerve injury model, but tolerance to morphine developed after 1 week while THC or CBD reduced allodynia over three weeks. Hyperalgesia gradually developed after sciatic nerve injury, and by the last day of testing, THC significantly reduced hyperalgesia, with a trend effect of CBD, and no effect of morphine. Mouse vocalizations were recorded throughout the experiment, and mice showed a large increase in ultrasonic, broadband clicks after sciatic nerve injury, which was reversed by THC, CBD, and morphine. This study demonstrates that mice voluntarily consume both cannabinoids and opioids via gelatin, and that cannabinoids provide long-term relief of chronic pain states. In addition, ultrasonic clicks may objectively represent mouse pain status and could be integrated into future pain models.",Edward J Y Leung;Brenden A Wong;Zeena M G Rivera;Lauren C Kruse;Jeremy J Clark;Benjamin B Land
157,Vanda Faria,"Expectancies of nicotine content have been shown to impact smokers' subjective responses and smoking behaviors. However, little is known about the neural substrates modulated by verbally induced expectancies in smokers. In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how verbally induced expectations, regarding the presence or absence of nicotine, modulated smokers' neural response to a nicotine-free odor. While laying in the scanner, all participants (N = 24) were given a nicotine-free odor, but whereas one group was correctly informed about the absence of nicotine (control group n = 12), the other group was led to believe that the presented odor contained nicotine (expectancy group n = 12). Smokers in the expectancy group had significantly increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses during the presentation of the nicotine-free odor in the left ventral tegmental area (VTA), and in the right insula, as compared to smokers in the control group (Regions of interest analysis with pFWE-corrected p ≤ 0.05). At a more liberal uncorrected statistical level (p-unc ≤ 0.001), increased bilateral reactivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was also observed in the expectancy group as compared with the control group. Our findings suggest that nicotine-expectancies induced through verbal instructions can modulate nicotine relevant brain regions, without nicotine administration, and provide further neural support for the key role that cognitive expectancies play in the cause and treatment of nicotine dependence.",Pengfei Han;Akshita Joshi;Paul Enck;Thomas Hummel
158,Mustafa Khalid,"Compared with the biological paradigms of classical conditioning, non-adaptive computational models are not capable of realistically simulating the biological behavioural functions of the hippocampal regions, because of their implausible requirement for a large number of learning trials, which can be on the order of hundreds. Additionally, these models did not attain a unified, final stable state even after hundreds of learning trials. Conversely, the output response has a different threshold for similar tasks in various models with prolonged transient response of unspecified status via the training or even testing phases. Accordingly, a green model is a combination of adaptive neuro-computational hippocampal and cortical models that is proposed by adaptively updating the whole weights in all layers for both intact networks and lesion networks using instar and outstar learning rules with adaptive resonance theory (ART). The green model sustains and expands the classical conditioning biological paradigms of the non-adaptive models. The model also overcomes the irregular output response behaviour by using the proposed feature of adaptivity. Further, the model successfully simulates the hippocampal regions without passing the final output response back to the whole network, which is considered to be biologically implausible. The results of the Green model showed a significant improvement confirmed by empirical studies of different tasks. In addition, the results indicated that the model outperforms the previously published models. All the obtained results successfully and quickly attained a stable, desired final state (with a unified concluding state of either ""1"" or ""0"") with a significantly shorter transient duration.",Jun Wu;Taghreed M Ali;Ahmed A Moustafa;Qiuguo Zhu;Rong Xiong
159,Qi Fang,"In the mammalian visual system, information from the retina streams into parallel bottom-up pathways. It remains unclear how these pathways interact to contribute to contextual modulation of visual cortical processing. By optogenetic inactivation and activation of mouse lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of thalamus, a homolog of pulvinar, or its projection to primary visual cortex (V1), we found that LP contributes to surround suppression of layer (L) 2/3 responses in V1 by driving L1 inhibitory neurons. This results in subtractive suppression of visual responses and an overall enhancement of orientation, direction, spatial, and size selectivity. Neurons in V1-projecting LP regions receive bottom-up input from the superior colliculus (SC) and respond preferably to non-patterned visual noise. The noise-dependent LP activity allows V1 to ""cancel"" noise effects and maintain its orientation selectivity under varying noise background. Thus, the retina-SC-LP-V1 pathway forms a differential circuit with the canonical retino-geniculate pathway to achieve context-dependent sharpening of visual representations.",Xiao-Lin Chou;Bo Peng;Wen Zhong;Li I Zhang;Huizhong Whit Tao
160,Yasaman Bagherzadeh,"Decreases in alpha synchronization are correlated with enhanced attention, whereas alpha increases are correlated with inattention. However, correlation is not causality, and synchronization may be a byproduct of attention rather than a cause. To test for a causal role of alpha synchrony in attention, we used MEG neurofeedback to train subjects to manipulate the ratio of alpha power over the left versus right parietal cortex. We found that a comparable alpha asymmetry developed over the visual cortex. The alpha training led to corresponding asymmetrical changes in visually evoked responses to probes presented in the two hemifields during training. Thus, reduced alpha was associated with enhanced sensory processing. Testing after training showed a persistent bias in attention in the expected directions. The results support the proposal that alpha synchrony plays a causal role in modulating attention and visual processing, and alpha training could be used for testing hypotheses about synchrony.",Daniel Baldauf;Dimitrios Pantazis;Robert Desimone
161,Yi-Rong Peng,"Many neuronal types occur as pairs that are similar in most respects but differ in a key feature. In some pairs of retinal neurons, called paramorphic, one member responds to increases and the other to decreases in luminance (ON and OFF responses). Here, we focused on one such pair, starburst amacrine cells (SACs), to explore how closely related neuronal types diversify. We find that ON and OFF SACs are transcriptionally distinct prior to their segregation, dendritic outgrowth, and synapse formation. The transcriptional repressor Fezf1 is selectively expressed by postmitotic ON SACs and promotes the ON fate and gene expression program while repressing the OFF fate and program. The atypical Rho GTPase Rnd3 is selectively expressed by OFF SACs and regulates their migration but is repressed by Fezf1 in ON SACs, enabling differential positioning of the two types. These results define a transcriptional program that controls diversification of a paramorphic pair.",Rebecca E James;Wenjun Yan;Jeremy N Kay;Alex L Kolodkin;Joshua R Sanes
162,Md Razib Hossain,"MDGA1 (MAM domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor) has recently been linked to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Dysregulation of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems has long been associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we measured prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response and ex vivo tissue content of monoamines and their metabolites in the frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus of Mdga1 homozygous (Mdga1-KO), Mdga1 heterozygous (Mdga1-HT) and wild-type (WT) male mice. We found that Mdga1-KO mice exhibited statistically significant impairment of PPI, and had higher levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) in all three brain regions studied compared with Mdga1-HT and WT mice (P < 0.05), while levels of norepinephrine, DA and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-methoxytyramine remained unchanged. Mdga1-KO mice also had a lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level in the striatum (P < 0.05) compared with WT mice. 5-HT levels remained unchanged with the exception of a significant increase in the level in the cortex. These data are the first evidence suggesting that MDGA1 deficiency leads to a pronounced deficit in PPI and plays an important role in perturbation of DA and 5-HT metabolism in mouse brain; such changes may contribute to a range of neuropsychiatric disorders.",Mostofa Jamal;Yu Tanoue;Daiki Ojima;Hiroo Takahashi;Takashi Kubota;Tuba M Ansary;Asuka Ito;Naoko Tanaka;Hiroshi Kinoshita;Yasushi Kishimoto;Tohru Yamamoto
163,Tuo Yang,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
A major gap in the field of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is whether or not long-lasting neuroprotection can be achieved. Moreover, the specific mechanisms underlying IPC and how they can be translated into the clinic remain uncertain. To fill these gaps, we tested the hypothesis that IPC exerts long-lasting structural and functional neuroprotection against ischemic stroke through the master gatekeeper of antioxidant defenses, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). We also tested whether the brain could be pharmaceutically preconditioned with a potent and blood-brain barrier-permeable Nrf2 activator, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxo-oleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-trifluoethyl amide (CDDO-TFEA).


METHODS
IPC was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 12 min, and ischemic stroke was generated by MCAO for 60 min in wild-type (WT) or Nrf2 knockout (KO) mice. Sensorimotor function, learning/memory skills, and brain tissue loss were measured up to 35 days after stroke. Primary rodent cortical neurons from wildtype (WT) and Nrf2 KO mice were subjected to lethal oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or a brief OGD episode as a preconditioning (PC) stimulus before OGD. Cell viability/death, lipid electrophile generation, and Nrf2 activation were measured. CDDO-TFEA or its vehicle was administered in vivo for three consecutive days before MCAO. Tissue loss and neurological tests were performed 35 days after stroke.


RESULTS
IPC significantly reduced sensorimotor deficits, post-stroke cognitive impairments, and brain tissue loss, 35 days after MCAO in WT mice. These enduring protective effects of IPC were inhibited in Nrf2 KO mice. In neuronal cultures, PC also endowed primary neurons with ischemic tolerance against OGD-induced cell death, an effect that was abolished by loss of Nrf2 expression in KO neurons. PC induced the generation of low levels of lipid electrophiles and led to activation of the Nrf2 pathway. The mechanism underlying IPC may be translatable, as exogenous administration of the Nrf2 activator CDDO-TFEA significantly reduced neurological dysfunction and ischemic brain damage after MCAO.


CONCLUSIONS
IPC provides long-lasting neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury and post-stroke cognitive dysfunction. Nrf2 activation plays a key role in this beneficial outcome and is a promising therapeutic target for the attenuation of ischemic brain injury.",Yang Sun;Qianqian Li;Senmiao Li;Yejie Shi;Rehana K Leak;Jun Chen;Feng Zhang

165,Chunhui Wu,"Clinical and preclinical researches have shown that sub-anesthetic ketamine elicits sustained antidepressant effects for up to 1-2 weeks. Pharmacokinetics studies (t1/2 = 23 min) in mice showed no ketamine residue at 24 h after sub-anesthetic or anesthetic ketamine administration. Therefore, this study aims to reveal the mechanism underlying these different biological functions at 24 h after sub-anesthetic and anesthetic ketamine treatment. First, at the animal behavioral level, we found that sub-anesthetic ketamine induced antidepressant and anxiolytic effects while anesthetic ketamine induced depressive-like phenotypes and cognitive impairment. Second, we examined the correlation between behavior phenotype and protein expression, and found that the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level is oppositely regulated by sub-anesthetic and anesthetic ketamine. Sub-anesthetic ketamine significantly increased the BDNF level, correlating to antidepressant effects; whereas anesthetic dose reduced BDNF expression in the hippocampus, correlating to depressive-like behaviors, anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. Third, the antidepressant effects of sub-anesthetic ketamine were prevented by pre-treatment of ANA-12, a Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) inhibitor. Thus, we conclude that BDNF may be the key factor underlying antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of sub-anesthetic ketamine at 24 h after treatment. These results may shed light on future studies and the development of long-lasting anti-depressant drugs and therapies.",Yu Wang;Yang He;Song Wu;Zhifei Xie;Jian Zhang;Jingshan Shen;Zhen Wang;Ling He
166,Jennifer D Ryan,"The value of case studies in informing our understanding of dissociations and interactions in memory was recognized early on by Endel Tulving, whose comprehensive work with the amnesic case K.C. helped to confirm distinctions between episodic and semantic memory. Following in this tradition, we examined memory and the use of cognitive strategies in the developmental amnesic case H.C., a young woman with structural abnormalities in the extended hippocampal system (Rosenbaum et al., 2014). H.C. was tested on two tasks, transitivity and transverse patterning, that each required learning the relations among items, and for the former, also examined the ability to make inferences across sets of relations. H.C. was tested across multiple sessions and demonstrated two seemingly contradictory patterns of performance: evidence of gradual learning, yet an inability to flexibly switch to a cognitive strategy that may otherwise benefit performance. Specifically, on the transitivity task, H.C. showed gradual learning of novel relations that led to successful inferential performance. On transverse patterning, H.C. showed some gradual learning of the relations among the objects across sessions, and expressed knowledge that the task followed 'rock-paper-scissors' rules. However, H.C. did not benefit from a unitization strategy, which had shown previous success with other amnesic cases (D'Angelo et al., 2015; Ryan, Moses, Barense, & Rosenbaum, 2013). H.C.'s over-reliance on 'rock-paper-scissors' rules, even in the face of alternate strategies, is suggestive of an inability to enact cognitive flexibility. Poor performance thus may have resulted from interference from the experimentally presented strategy on her self-imposed strategy. The present findings echo work reported by Tulving in case K.C. (Tulving, Hayman, & Macdonald, 1991). Whereas neurologically intact individuals may rely on the functions of the hippocampal system to rapidly learn new information and resolve interference, some individuals with hippocampal amnesia may learn information gradually, but such learning is particularly prone to interference, resulting in an inability to flexibly adapt to changes in the learning conditions in order to optimize performance.",Maria C D'Angelo;Arber Kacollja;Sandra Gardner;R Shayna Rosenbaum

168,Toru Nakamura,"Dopamine (DA) signaling in the basal ganglia plays important roles in motor control. Motor deficiencies were previously reported in dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) knockout mice. While these results indicate the involvement of DA receptors in motor execution, the null knockout (KO) mouse lacks the specificity necessary to determine when and where in the brain D1R and D2R function in motor execution. To address these questions, we restricted the loss of function temporally and spatially by using D1R conditional knockdown (cKD) mice and mice injected with antagonists against DA receptors directly into the dorsal striatum. In addition, we address the DA and acetylcholine (ACh) balance hypothesis by using antagonists against ACh receptors. We tested the motor ability of the mice with a newly devised task named the accelerating step-wheel. In this task, the maximum running speed was measured in a situation where the wheel rotation speed was gradually accelerated in one trial. We found significant decreases in the maximum running speed of D1R cKD mice and the mice injected with the antagonist against D1R or muscarinic ACh receptor.

169,Satoko Koganemaru,"Although specific brain regions are important for regularly patterned limb movements, the rhythm generation system that governs bipedal locomotion in humans is not thoroughly understood. We investigated whether rhythmic transcranial brain stimulation over the cerebellum could alter walking rhythm. Fourteen healthy subjects performed over-ground walking for 10 min during which they were given, in a random order, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the left cerebellum at the approximated frequency of their gait cycle, tACS over the skin of the scalp, and during sham stimulation. Cerebellar tACS showed a significant entrainment of gait rhythm compared with the control conditions. When the direction of the tACS currents was symmetrically inverted, some subjects showed entrainment at an approximately 180° inverted phase, suggesting that gait modulation is dependent on current orientation. These findings indicate that tACS over cerebellum can modulate gait generation system in cerebellum and become an innovative approach for the recovery of locomotion in patients with gait disturbances caused by CNS disorders.",Yusuke Mikami;Masao Matsuhashi;Dennis Q Truong;Marom Bikson;Kenji Kansaku;Tatsuya Mima
170,Hongning Jia,"Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is associated with high neonatal mortality and permanent neurologic deficit. Recent data suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) may have essential functions in the regulation of HIE. This study aims to investigate the functional role of miR-499-5p and the underlying mechanism in regulating neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced brain injury. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blotting assay were performed to investigate the relationship between miR-499-5p and C-reactive protein (CRP). TUNEL staining assay was applied to evaluate neuronal cell apoptosis in the hippocampus after administration of miR-499-5p in HIE rat model. Neurobehavioral assays were conducted to evaluate the effect of miR-499-5p on the neurological functions of rat pups with HI-induced brain injury. Our study showed that miR-499-5p regulated CRP expression in L-02 cells and rat HIE model. The miR-499-5p treatment resulted in significant reduction of neuronal cell apoptosis and the infarct size of the brain. Furthermore, administration of miR-499-5p significantly improved spatial learning ability, spatial memory, and locomotor function of rat pups with HIE. Our data demonstrated that miR-499-5p have a neuroprotective effect in HI-induced brain injury in rat pups, which suggests a potential therapeutic application of miR-499-5p in the treatment of neonatal HIE.",Mingwei Qu;Guimei Fan;Huijun Wu;Limin Wang
171,Yijie Zhao,"The neural mechanisms associated with the limited capacity of working memory (WM) has long been studied, but it is still unclear which neural regions are associated with the precision of visual WM. Here, an orientation recall task for estimating the trial-wise precision of visual WM was performed and then repeated two weeks later in an fMRI scanner. Results showed that activity in frontal and parietal regions during WM maintenance scaled with WM load, but not with the precision of WM (i.e., recall error in radians). Conversely, activity in the lateral occipital complex (LOC) during WM maintenance was not affected by memory load, but rather, correlated with WM precision on a trial-by-trial basis. Moreover, activity in LOC also correlated with the individual participant's precision of WM from a separate behavioral experiment. Interestingly, a region within the prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), exhibited greater functional connectivity with LOC when the WM load increased. Together, our findings provide unique evidence that the LOC supports visual WM precision, while communication between the IFJ and LOC varies based on WM load demands. These results suggest an intriguing possibility that distinct neural mechanisms may be associated with general content (load) or detailed information (precision) of WM.",Shuguang Kuai;Theodore P Zanto;Yixuan Ku
172,Sabrini Sabrini,"Animal studies have consistently observed neuronal death following methamphetamine (MA) administration, however, these have not been systematically reviewed. This systematic review aims to present the evidence for MA-induced neuronal death in animals (rodents) and identify the regions affected. Locating the brain regions in which neuronal death occurs in animal studies will provide valuable insight into the linkage between MA consumption and the structural alterations observed in the human brain. The data were collected from three databases: Scopus, Ovid, and the Web of Science. Thirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were divided into two sub-groups, i.e. acute and repeated administration. Twenty-six (of 27) acute and ten (of 11) repeated administration studies observed neuronal death. A meta-analysis was not possible due to different variables between studies, i.e. species, treatment regimens, withdrawal periods, methods of quantification, and regions studied. Acute MA treatment induced neuronal death in the frontal cortex, striatum, and substantia nigra, but not in the hippocampus, whereas repeated MA administration led to neuronal loss in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum. In addition, when animals self-administered the drug, neuronal death was observed at much lower doses than the doses administered by experimenters. There is some overlap in the regions where neuronal death occurred in animals and the identified regions from human studies. For instance, gray matter deficits have been observed in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of MA users. The findings presented in this review implicate that not only does MA induce neuronal death in animals, but it also damages the same regions affected in human users. Despite the inter-species differences, animal studies have contributed significantly to addiction research, and are still of great assistance for future research with a more relevant model of compulsive drug use in humans.",Russell Bruce;Y Wang Grace;C Lin Joanne;J Kirk Ian;E Curley Louise
173,Cheng Wang,"Evidence of structural abnormalities in the nervous system of recreational drug [e.g., phencyclidine (PCP) or ketamine] users and/or preclinical animal research models suggests interference with the activity of multiple neurotransmitters, particularly glutamate neurotransmission. The damage to the central nervous system (CNS) may include neuronal loss, synaptic changes, disturbed neural network formation and reduced projections to subcortical fields. Notably, the reduced projections may considerably compromise the establishment of the subcortical areas, such as the nucleus accumbens located in the basal forebrain. With its abundant dopaminergic innervation, the nucleus accumbens is believed to be directly associated with addictive behaviors and mental disorders. This review seeks to delineate the relationship between PCP/ketamine-induced loss of cortical neurons and the reduced level of polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) in the striatum, and the likely changes in striatal synaptogenesis during development. The basic mechanism of how PSA-NCAM cell surface expression may be regulated will also be discussed, as well as the hypothesis that PSA-NCAM activity is critical to the regulation of synaptic protein expression. Overall, the present review will address the general hypothesis that damage/interruption of cortico-striatal communication and subcortical synaptogenesis could underlie the erratic/sensitization or addictive states produced by chronic or prolonged PCP/ketamine usage.",Amy Inselman;Shuliang Liu;Fang Liu
174,Marta Barenys,"The increasing use of illegal drugs by pregnant women causes a public health concern because it is associated with health risks for mothers and their developing children. One of such drugs is MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) or ecstasy due to its high consumption in relevant age and sex groups and its adverse effects on human and rodent developing brains. To thoroughly review the current knowledge on the developmentally neurotoxic potential of MDMA we systematically collected and summarized articles investigating developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) of MDMA in humans and animals in in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we summarized the findings in a putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP). From an initial 299 articles retrieved from the bibliographic databases Web of Science, PubMed and DART, we selected 39 articles according to inclusion/exclusion criteria for data collection after title/abstract and full text screening. Of these 3 where epidemiological studies, 34 where in vivo studies in mice and rats and 2 were in vitro studies. The three epidemiological studies reported from the same longitudinal study and suggested that MDMA exposure during pregnancy impairs neuromotor function in infants. In rat, postnatal exposure towards MDMA also caused locomotor deficits as well as impaired spatial learning that might be associated with decreased serotonin levels in the hippocampus. In vitro MDMA caused cytotoxicity at high concentrations and effects on the serotonergic and neuritogenic alterations at lower concentrations which are in line with some of the in vivo alterations observed. Considering the adverse outcomes of developmental MDMA described in humans and in rodents we summarized the first putative AOP on developmental compound exposure leading to impaired neuromotor function in children. For generation of this AOP, MDMA exposure was taken as a model compound. In addition, we hypothesized a second AOP involving developmental disturbance of the dopaminergic system. However, further in vitro mechanistic studies are needed to understand the molecular initiating event(s) (MIE) triggering the downstream cascades and obtain consistent evidences causally linking the adverse outcome to effects at the cellular, organ and organism level.",Ingrid Reverte;Stefan Masjosthusmann;Jesús Gómez-Catalán;Ellen Fritsche
175,Rudolf Černý,"OBJECTIVES
This study aimed to assess vestibular function in 39 patients who underwent neurectomy for vestibular schwannoma.


METHOD
Semicircular canal reactivity was measured by video head-impulse test using high-frequency passive head acceleration. Response gain was calculated as a ratio between the areas under the eye-velocity curve and the head-velocity curve.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Student t-test was used for to compare quantitative variables. ANOVA was used to test inter-group differences in categoric variables.


RESULTS
In all cases, surgery-side gain on head impulse test was low, with increased gain asymmetry. A subgroup of 7 patients (18%) showed relatively high gain in vestibulo-ocular reflex on the surgery side. Caloric reaction was absent in all cases. These findings indicate that residual vestibular function can be conserved following vestibular schwannoma extirpation.


CONCLUSION
Cases with moderate vestibulo-ocular reflex gain were a subgroup with partial conservation of vestibular nerve fibers. Whether this is a predictor of better functional prognosis remains to be elucidated. Higher gain correlated with less extensive surgery and sparing of the inferior vestibular nerve. Low gain correlated with complete vestibular neurectomy. This information may guide rehabilitation strategy following surgery.",Zuzana Balatková;Silvie Hrubá;Michaela Danková;Petr Volf;Patrik Kutílek;Jan Plzák;Veronika Bandurová;Vladimír Koucký;Eva Mrázkova;Zdeněk Čada
176,Giulia Prando,"Contemporary neuroscience has embraced network science and dynamical systems to study the complex and self-organized structure of the human brain. Despite the developments in non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, a full understanding of the directed interactions in whole brain networks, referred to as effective connectivity, as well as their role in the emergent brain dynamics is still lacking. The main reason is that estimating brain connectivity requires solving a formidable large-scale inverse problem from indirect and noisy measurements. Building on the dynamic causal modelling framework, the present study offers a novel method for estimating whole-brain effective connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance data. To this purpose sparse estimation methods are adapted to infer the parameters of our novel model, which is based on a linearized, region-specific haemodynamic response function. The resulting Algorithm is shown to compare favorably with state-of-the art methods when tested on both synthetic and real data. We also provide a graph-theoretical analysis on the whole-brain effective connectivity estimated using data from a cohort of healthy individuals, which reveals properties such as asymmetry in the connectivity structure as well as the different roles of brain areas in favoring segregation or integration.",Mattia Zorzi;Alessandra Bertoldo;Maurizio Corbetta;Marco Zorzi;Alessandro Chiuso
177,Jonas Bause,"Functional imaging with sub-millimeter spatial resolution is a basic requirement for assessing functional MRI (fMRI) responses across different cortical depths, and is used extensively in the emerging field of laminar fMRI. Such studies seek to investigate the detailed functional organization of the brain and may develop to a new powerful tool for human neuroscience. However, several studies have shown that measurement of laminar fMRI responses can be biased by the image acquisition and data processing strategies. In this work, measurements with three different gradient-echo EPI protocols with a voxel size down to 650 μm isotropic were performed at 9.4 T. We estimated how prospective motion correction can help to improve spatial accuracy by reducing the number of spatial resampling steps in postprocessing. In addition, we demonstrate key requirements for accurate geometric distortion correction to ensure that distortion correction maps are properly aligned to the functional data and that strong variations of distortions near large veins can lead to signal overlays which cannot be corrected for during postprocessing. Furthermore, this study illustrates the spatial extent of bias induced by pial and other larger veins in laminar BOLD experiments. Since these issues under investigation affect studies performed with more conventional spatial resolutions, the methods applied in this work may also help to improve the understanding of the BOLD signal more broadly.",Jonathan R Polimeni;Johannes Stelzer;Myung-Ho In;Philipp Ehses;Pablo Kraemer-Fernandez;Ali Aghaeifar;Eric Lacosse;Rolf Pohmann;Klaus Scheffler
178,Emily Hill,"The neuromodulator adenosine is released during seizure activity to provide negative feedback suppression of on-going activity and to delay the occurrence of the next burst of activity. Adenosine acts via multiple G protein coupled receptors including the A1 receptor (A1R) which inhibits neurotransmitter release and hyperpolarises neuronal membrane potential. The hyperpolarisation is produced, at least in part, by the activation of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels. We have used tertiapin-Q (TQ), a potent and selective inhibitor of GIRK channels, to assess the role of GIRK channels in controlling seizure activity in areas CA1 and CA2 of mouse hippocampal slices. TQ (100-300 nM) blocked ∼50% of the adenosine-mediated membrane potential hyperpolarisation of hippocampal CA1 and CA2 neurons. TQ (100 nM) had no significant effect on synaptic transmission in area CA1 of the hippocampus but enhanced transmission in CA2, an effect prevented by blocking A1Rs. TQ (100 nM) increased the frequency of spontaneous activity (induced by removing Mg2+ and increasing K+) and blunted the effects of exogenous adenosine on the suppression of activity. TQ had a significantly greater effect on electrically-stimulated seizure activity induced in CA2 versus that in CA1, producing a greater increase in both the duration and amplitude of the stimulated bursts. This is consistent with the greater A1R density and A1R activation tone in CA2. Thus GIRK channels play a role in the supressing effects of adenosine on seizure activity.",Charlotte Hickman;Rebecca Diez;Mark Wall
179,Qian Cui,"Previous studies have reported abnormalities in static brain activity and connectivity in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, the dynamic patterns of brain connectivity in patients with GAD have not been fully explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the dynamic local brain functional connectivity in patients with GAD using dynamic regional phase synchrony (DRePS), a newly developed method for assessing intrinsic dynamic local functional connectivity. Seventy-four patients with GAD and 74 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to the HCs, patients with GAD exhibited decreased DRePS values in the bilateral caudate, left hippocampus, left anterior insula, left inferior frontal gyrus, and right fusiform gyrus extending to inferior temporal gyrus. The DRePS value of the left hippocampus was negatively correlated with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Moreover, these abnormal DRePS patterns could be used to distinguish patients with GAD from HCs in an independent sample (18 patients with GAD and 21 HCs). Our findings provide further evidence on brain dysfunction in GAD from the perspective of the dynamic behaviour of local connections, suggesting that patients with GAD may have an insufficient brain adaptation. This study provides new insights into the neurocognitive mechanism of GAD and could potentially inform the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Future studies on GAD could benefit from combining the DRePS method with task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and non-invasive brain stimulation.",Yuyan Chen;Qin Tang;Shaoqiang Han;Shan Hu;Yajing Pang;Fengmei Lu;Xiaoyu Nan;Wei Sheng;Qian Shen;Yifeng Wang;Zongling He;Huafu Chen
180,F M Merced-Nieves,"Maternal prenatal stress can adversely impact subsequent child neurodevelopment, but little is known about its effect on cognitive development in infancy. This analysis of 107 infants from a prospective birth cohort assessed whether prenatal stress disrupts sexually dimorphic performance typically observed on a physical reasoning task. Maternal stress was assessed at 8-14 and 33-37 gestational weeks using the Perceived Stress Scale. Stress was defined as: low (scores below the median at both times), medium (scores above the median at one of the two times), and high (scores above the median at both times). At 4.5 months infants saw videos of two events: one impossible and the other possible. In the impossible event a box was placed against a wall without support underneath. In the possible event the box was placed against the wall, supported by the floor. Looking time at each event was recorded via infrared eye-tracking. Previous literature has shown that, at 4.5 months of age, girls typically look significantly longer at the impossible than at the possible event, suggesting that they expect the unsupported box to fall and are surprised when it does not. Boys tend to look equally at the two events suggesting that they do not share this expectation. This sex difference was replicated in the current study. General linear models stratified by sex and adjusted for household income, maternal education, mother's age at birth, infant's age at exam, and order of event presentation revealed that girls whose mothers reported high perceived stress during pregnancy had shorter looking time differences between the impossible and possible events than girls whose mothers reported low perceived stress (β = -7.1; 95% CI: -12.0, -2.2 s; p = 0.006). Similar to boys, girls in the highest stress category spent about the same amount of time looking at each event. For boys, there were no significant looking time differences by maternal stress level. This finding suggests prenatal stress is associated with a delay in the development of physical reasoning in girls.",A Aguiar;K L C Dzwilewski;S Musaad;S A Korrick;S L Schantz

184,Luis E Almaguer-Mederos,"BACKGROUND
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disorder due to a CAG-repeat expansion. This work is intended to identify modifiers of the clinical phenotype in SCA2, following up on recent genome-wide association analyses that demonstrated the prominent role of DNA-damage repair and methylation for the severity and progression of polyglutamine diseases. In particular, we assessed the impact of MTHFR as rate-limiting enzyme in DNA methylation pathways, which modulates cerebellar neurotransmission and motor neuron atrophy.


METHODS
A sample of 166 Cuban SCA2 patients and of 130 healthy subjects from the same geographical and ethnic background was selected. The ATXN2 CAG repeat length was determined by PCR followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two amino acid substitutions known to decrease the enzyme activity of MTHFR, encoded by C677T and A1298C polymorphisms, were assessed by PCR/RFLP.


RESULTS
No significant differences were observed for C677T or A1298C alleles or genotype frequencies between cases and controls, confirming that disease risk in SCA2 does not depend on MTHFR activity. However, MTHFR A1298C genotypes showed a significant association with saccade latency.


CONCLUSIONS
\MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is associated with saccade latency in SCA2 patients, but not with disease risk, age at onset or maximal saccade velocity.

185,Landon J Dittel,"BACKGROUND
EAE is an inflammatory autoimmune process of the CNS that resembles multiple sclerosis (MS) and provides a useful animal model for the evaluation of mechanisms of action for potential immunomodulatory therapies. Oral ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) can decrease clinical disease, IL-17 and Th1-like encephalitogenic IFN-γ secretion and increase Treg frequency. The mechanism by which oral ACTH decreases inflammatory proteins and increases Treg cell frequencies is unknown.


OBJECTIVE
IL-6 is a pivotal cytokine in the gut that determines the relative frequencies of Th17 vs Treg cells. We examined whether oral ACTH inhibited IL-6 in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in EAE.


DESIGN/METHODS
B6 mice were immunized with MOG peptide 35-55 and gavaged with scrambled ACTH (scrambled melanocyte stimulating hormone [scrambled α-MSH]) or ACTH 1-39 during ongoing disease.


RESULTS
Ingested (oral) ACTH inhibited ongoing clinical disease. In the lamina propria (LP) immune compartment, there were significantly less CD11b + IL-6 and IL-17 producing lymphocytes from ACTH fed mice compared to s-MSH fed mice. There was also a decrease in the frequency of IL-17 and IFN-γ producing spleen cells and an increase in CD4 + FoxP3+ Treg cell frequency in ACTH fed mice compared to s-MSH fed control spleens. There were less IFN-γ producing CNS lymphocytes in ACTH fed mice compared to s-MSH fed control CNS.

To identify timing for initiation of anticoagulation therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with non-valvular AF as regards safety and efficacy by detecting the rate of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and recurrent ischemic symptoms (RIS) during follow-up.


METHODS
This is a prospective observational cohort study conducted at King Fahd Hospital of the University including 120 patients with AIS/TIAs from July 2016 till July 2018. We compared patients who received anticoagulants 1-6 days (Group I (45.83%), 7-14 days, Group II (35%), and > 14 days after the ischemic event (Group III (19.17%). Follow-up was at least 3 months and included identifying ICH or RIS.


RESULT
ICH has occurred in 26.67% (n = 32) patients with a highly statistically significant association with time of treatment (P-value = .01) being higher in group I (n = 17) compared to only 1 case in group III. Subgroup analyses on the ICH patients (n = 32) has revealed statistical significant association with higher NIHSS score (P = .001). Also, the type of anticoagulants used between three groups pointed to an association existence (p = .02), however, the direction of this association cannot be determined. There was no statistical significant association between RIS (occurred in 4.16% (n = 5) with time of treatment (P = .754).

187,Emma Murray,"Puberty is a critical period of neural development, and exposure to stress and inflammation during this period is thought to increase vulnerability to mental illness. The gut microbiome influences brain functioning and behavior and impacts mental health. Yet, the role of the gut microbiome during puberty, a period during which mental health conditions tend to onset, remains largely uninvestigated. We first examined age and sex differences in gut microbial changes among CD-1 mice exposed to an immune challenge (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) at 6 weeks of age (during the pubertal stress-sensitive period) or at 10 weeks of age (in adulthood) (Experiment 1). Compared to their adult counterparts, pubertal males and females showed more significant changes in gut microbial composition following LPS treatment, including the depletion of numerous bacterial genera such as Lactobacillus. Given the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus strains on stress and behaviour, we next investigated whether replenishment of the gut with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) throughout pubertal development would modulate LPS-induced sickness and enduring effects on memory dysfunction, anxiety-like behaviour and stress reactivity in adulthood (Experiment 2). LPS treatment at 6 weeks of age created enduring changes in anxiety-like behaviors among males only. Similarly, only males showed the protective effects of L. reuteri supplementation during puberty in preventing longstanding LPS-induced changes in anxiety-like behavior and stress-induced brain activation. These findings demonstrate that colonizing the gut with L. reuteri during puberty modulates sickness responses and enduring behavioural and neurochemical outcomes in a sex-specific manner.

189,Anne M Verstegen,"BACKGROUND
Our understanding of the neural circuits controlling micturition and continence is constrained by a paucity of techniques for measuring voiding in awake, behaving mice.


NEW METHOD
To facilitate progress in this area, we developed a new, non-invasive assay, micturition video thermography (MVT), using a down-facing thermal camera above mice on a filter paper floor.


RESULTS
Most C57B6/J mice void infrequently, with a stereotyped behavioral sequence, and usually in a corner. The timing of each void is indicated by the warm thermal contrast of freshly voided urine. Over the following 10-15 min, urine cools to ∼3 °C below the ambient temperature and spreads radially in the filter paper. By measuring the area of cool contrast comprising this ""thermal void spot,"" we can derive the initially voided volume. Thermal videos also reveal mouse behaviors including a home-corner preference apart from void spots, and a stereotyped, seconds-long pause while voiding.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS AND CONCLUSIONS
MVT is a robust, non-invasive method for measuring the timing, volume, and location of voiding. It improves on an existing technique, the void spot assay, by adding timing information, and unlike the cystometrogram preparation, MVT does not require surgical catheterization. Combining MVT with current neuroscience techniques will improve our understanding of the neural circuits that control continence, which is important for addressing the growing number of patients with urinary incontinence as the population ages.",Margaret M Tish;Luca P Szczepanik;Mark L Zeidel;Joel C Geerling
190,Marinho A Lopes,"OBJECTIVE
The effectiveness of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to inform epilepsy surgery depends on where iEEG electrodes are implanted. This decision is informed by noninvasive recording modalities such as scalp EEG. Herein we propose a framework to interrogate scalp EEG and determine epilepsy lateralization to aid in electrode implantation.


METHODS
We use eLORETA to map source activities from seizure epochs recorded from scalp EEG and consider 15 regions of interest (ROIs). Functional networks are then constructed using the phase-locking value and studied using a mathematical model. By removing different ROIs from the network and simulating their impact on the network's ability to generate seizures in silico, the framework provides predictions of epilepsy lateralization. We consider 15 individuals from the EPILEPSIAE database and study a total of 62 seizures. Results were assessed by taking into account actual intracranial implantations and surgical outcome.


RESULTS
The framework provided potentially useful information regarding epilepsy lateralization in 12 out of the 15 individuals (p=0.02, binomial test).


CONCLUSIONS
Our results show promise for the use of this framework to better interrogate scalp EEG to determine epilepsy lateralization.

192,Farzad Salehpour,"The application of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) for neuronal stimulation is studied in different animal models and in humans, and has shown to improve cerebral metabolic activity and blood flow, and provide neuroprotection via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways. Recently, intranasal PBMT (i-PBMT) has become an attractive and potential method for the treatment of brain conditions. Herein, we provide a summary of different intranasal light delivery approaches including a nostril-based portable method and implanted deep-nasal methods for the effective systemic or direct irradiation of the brain. Nostril-based i-PBMT devices are available, using either lasers or light emitting diodes (LEDs), and can be applied either alone or in combination to transcranial devices (the latter applied directly to the scalp) to treat a wide range of brain conditions such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular diseases, depression and anxiety as well as insomnia. Evidence shows that nostril-based i-PBMT improves blood rheology and cerebral blood flow, so that, without needing to puncture blood vessels, i-PBMT may have equivalent results to a peripheral intravenous laser irradiation procedure. Up to now, no studies were conducted to implant PBMT light sources deep within the nose in a clinical setting, but simulation studies suggest that deep-nasal PBMT via cribriform plate and sphenoid sinus might be an effective method to deliver light to the ventromedial part of the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex.

Vitamin D is involved in brain development and functioning, as well as in regulation of neurotrophic factors. Changes in the expression of those factors are possibly responsible for morphologic abnormalities and symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia.


OBJECTIVE
The main goal of this research was to investigate the interrelationship between vitamin D, nerve growth factors (NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], and neuregulin-1 [NRG1]), and schizophrenia symptom domains.


METHODS
This research included 97 inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Blood samples were taken in order to analyze concentrations of vitamin D, BDNF, NRG1, and NGF growth factors. The obtained results were used in a multiple regression analysis.


RESULTS
The vitamin D concentration positively affected the concentration of NRG1 (F = 8.583, p = 0.005) but not the concentration of other investigated growth factors (BDNF and NGF). The clinical characteristics and symptom domains of schizophrenia seemed to be unaffected by the concentrations of vitamin D, BDNF, and NGF, while the NRG1 concentration significantly affected positive symptom domains of schizophrenia (F = 4.927, p = 0.030).


CONCLUSION
The vitamin D concentration positively affected NRG1 levels but not schizophrenia symptomatology as measured by PANSS. The as-sociation between the two could be intermediated via NRG1.",Ante Silić;Ivona Orlović;Branka Vidrih;Danijel Crnković;Dalibor Karlović

The prevalence and incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not fully established, and this varies depending on the studied population.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate the prevalence/incidence of ALS patients in Antioquia-Colombia.


METHODOLOGY
Observational/descriptive study by reviewing clinical records from 2010 to 2014. Cases with possible, probable and definite ALS were included. To estimate the prevalence/incidence, capture-recapture method was used.


RESULTS
Point prevalence in December 2014 was 4.9/100,000 (95% CI 2.0-7.8), and the incidence was 1.4/100,000/year (95% CI 0.5-2.2). The median survival was 4 years. Spinal-onset was observed in 62.4% of the included patients.


CONCLUSION
Prevalence, incidence and clinical presentation of ALS in Antioquia are similar to most studies reported worldwide. However, prevalence in Antioquia seems to be slightly higher than in other studies from Latin -American countries. This may derive from the inclusion criteria and case detection methodology adopted, but sociodemographic and genetic factors should be considered.",Edwing Franco Dáger;Daniel C Aguirre-Acevedo;Mamede de Carvalho;Juan Solano-Atehortúa
195,Jaime Luna,"INTRODUCTION
Neurological disorders are an important cause of disability and death worldwide. The distribution of these disorders differs significantly in developing countries. Screening questionnaires have been used as an important tool to detect neurological illnesses. This systematic literature review aimed to report the validity of screening questionnaires for neurological disorders in developing countries.


METHODS
The PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Science-Direct, and PASCAL databases were searched. All published studies performed in developing countries were eligible. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 tool. Summary measures of validity were reported (sensitivity and specificity).


RESULTS
Eight hundred and thirty-five records were identified, and 49 articles that met eligibility criteria were selected. The most frequently neurological disorders detected with a screening tool were epilepsy, stroke, and neuropathies (77, 53, and 40%, respectively). Ten screening questionnaires were accessible. Two questionnaires were mainly used to detect neurological disorders: the World Health Organization Protocol for Epidemiologic Studies of Neurologic Disorders and the Ten Questions Questionnaire. The sensitivity of the questionnaires was ranged from 84 to 100% and 56 to 100%, respectively.


CONCLUSION
This systematic review presents evidence that screening questionnaires are valid tools to detect neurological disorders in developing countries. Disease detection provides epidemiological data and the opportunity to implement secondary and tertiary prevention strategies that will contribute to reduce the global burden of neurological disorders.",Charline Leroi;Pierre-Marie Preux;Edgard Brice Ngoungou;Benoît Marin;Farid Boumediene
196,Francisco Donoso,"BACKGROUND
Polyphenols are phytochemicals that have been associated with therapeutic effects in stress-related disorders. Indeed, studies suggest that polyphenols exert significant neuroprotection against multiple neuronal injuries, including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, but the mechanisms are unclear. Evidence indicates that polyphenol neuroprotection may be mediated by activation of Nrf2, a transcription factor associated with antioxidant and cell survival responses. On the other hand, in stress-linked disorders, Fkbp5 is a novel molecular target for treatment because of its capacity to regulate glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. However, it is not clear the role Fkbp5 plays in polyphenol-mediated stress modulation. In this study, the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of the naturally derived polyphenols xanthohumol and quercetin against cytotoxicity induced by corticosterone were investigated in primary cortical cells.


METHODS
Primary cortical cells containing both neurons and astrocytes were pre-incubated with different concentrations of quercetin and xanthohumol to examine the neuroprotective effects of polyphenols on cell viability, morphology, and gene expression following corticosterone insult.


RESULTS
Both polyphenols tested prevented the reduction of cell viability and alterations of neuronal/astrocytic numbers due to corticosterone exposure. Basal levels of Bdnf mRNA were also decreased after corticosterone insult; however, this was reversed by both polyphenol treatments. Interestingly, the Nrf2 inhibitor blocked xanthohumol but not quercetin-mediated neuroprotection. In contrast, we found that Fkbp5 expression is exclusively modulated by quercetin.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that naturally derived polyphenols protect cortical cells against corticosterone-induced cytotoxicity and enhance cell survival via modulation of the Nrf2 pathway and expression of Fkbp5.",Valerie T Ramírez;Anna V Golubeva;Gerard M Moloney;Catherine Stanton;Timothy G Dinan;John F Cryan
197,Michael Schmutzer,"BACKGROUND
Spinal arachnoid cysts (SAC) are rare mostly idiopathic intradural lesions with compression of the spinal cord and clinical signs of radiculo- and/or myelopathy. We retrospectively analyzed radiological and clinical characteristics of patients with surgical treatment of SAC including a subgroup evaluation of long-term outcome and QoL.


METHOD
Patients with SAC treated between 1993 and 2017 were evaluated. Craniocaudal (c.c.) and anteroposterior (a.p) cyst diameters were measured pre- and post-OP. McCormick and Odom score for myelopathy, general outcome and QoL (SF-36, EORTC-QLQ30) were recorded.


RESULTS
A total of 72 patients (female:male = 1.9:1) were analyzed with mean FU of 44.8 ± 60 months (long-term data from 25 patients with FU 78.2 ± 63.9 months). All had surgery due to solitary cysts: 10 cervical (13.9%), 45 thoracic (62.5%), and 17 lumbosacral (23.6%), the majority (79.2%) located dorsally. Main symptoms were gait disturbance (80%), dysesthesia (64%) and paresis (80%). Patients had (hemi-)laminectomy with cyst fenestration in 48 (66.7%) and complete resection in 18 cases (25.0%). Four cases (5.5%) were treated by cystoperitoneal shunt, 2 by marsupialization (2.8%). In total, 11 revisions were necessary in 9/72 (12.5%) patients (one patient underwent 3 revisions). Two patients were reoperated for wound revision/epidural hematoma (each n = 1). Seven patients needed additional cyst wall resection after 1.5-31.0 months due to insufficient cyst shrinking and persistent clinical symptoms after first surgery; most of the cysts were multiple septated and of post-hemorrhagic origin. The mean c.c. size decreased from 5.2 ± 3.7 cm pre-OP to 2.7 ± 3.9 cm (p < 0.05); the a.p. diameter decreased from 1.0 ± 0.5 cm to 0.3 ± 0.3 cm (p < 0.0001) without significant differences between fenestration and resection. McCormick and Odom scores revealed improved symptoms, particularly of gait disturbance, sensory deficits, and general performance. Long-term FU displayed satisfying QoL performance without differences of fenestration or resection.


CONCLUSION
SAC mostly affect women and are predominantly located in the thoracic spine, becoming apparent with clinical myelopathy. For cysts without intracystic septae and compartments, both fenestration and resection of the cyst wall provided significant reduction of cyst size and clinical improvement.",Joerg-Christian Tonn;Stefan Zausinger
198,J-Y Puigbò,"In order to deal with the uncertainty in the world, our brains need to be able to flexibly switch between the exploration of new sensory representations and exploitation of previously acquired ones. This requires forming accurate estimations of what and how much something is expected. While modeling has allowed for the development of several ways to form predictions, how the brain could implement those is still under debate. Here, we recognize acetylcholine as one of the main neuromodulators driving learning based on uncertainty, promoting the exploration of new sensory representations. We identify its interactions with cortical inhibitory interneurons and derive a biophysically grounded computational model able to capture and learn from uncertainty. This model allows us to understand inhibition beyond gain control by suggesting that different interneuron subtypes either encode predictions or estimate their uncertainty, facilitating detection of unexpected cues. Moreover, we show how acetylcholine-like neuromodulation uniquely interacts with global and local sources of inhibition, disrupting perceptual certainty and promoting the rapid acquisition of new perceptual cues. Altogether, our model proposes that cortical acetylcholine favors sensory exploration over exploitation in a cortical microcircuit dedicated to estimating sensory uncertainty.",X D Arsiwalla;M A González-Ballester;P F M J Verschure
199,Daniel Leite Góes Gitaí,"An initial precipitating injury in the brain, such as after status epilepticus (SE), evolves into chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We investigated changes in the miRNA composition of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the forebrain after the establishment of SE-induced chronic TLE. We induced SE in young Fischer 344 rats through graded intraperitoneal injections of kainic acid, which resulted in consistent spontaneous recurrent seizures at ~ 3 months post-SE. We isolated EVs from the entire forebrain of chronically epileptic rats and age-matched naïve control animals through an ultracentrifugation method and performed miRNA-sequencing studies to discern changes in the miRNA composition of forebrain-derived EVs in chronic epilepsy. EVs from both naïve and epileptic forebrains displayed spherical or cup-shaped morphology, a comparable size range, and CD63 expression but lacked the expression of a deep cellular marker GM130. However, miRNA-sequencing studies suggested downregulation of 3 miRNAs (miR-187-5p, miR-346, and miR-331-3p) and upregulation of 4 miRNAs (miR-490-5p, miR-376b-3p, miR-493-5p, and miR-124-5p) in EVs from epileptic forebrains with fold changes ranging from 1.5 to 2.4 (p < 0.0006; FDR < 0.05). By using geNorm and Normfinder software, we identified miR-487 and miR-221 as the best combination of reference genes for measurement of altered miRNAs found in the epileptic forebrain through qRT-PCR studies. The validation revealed that only miR-346 and miR-331-3p were significantly downregulated in EVs from the epileptic forebrain. The enrichment pathway analysis of these miRNAs showed an overrepresentation of signaling pathways that are linked to molecular mechanisms underlying chronic epilepsy, including GABA-ergic (miR-346 targets) and mTOR (miR-331-3p targets) systems. Thus, the packaging of two miRNAs into EVs in neural cells is considerably altered in chronic epilepsy. Functional studies on these two miRNAs may uncover their role in the pathophysiology and treatment of TLE.",Ygor Daniel Ramos Dos Santos;Raghavendra Upadhya;Maheedhar Kodali;Leelavathi N Madhu;Ashok K Shetty
200,Wei-Ping Jen,"The Twist basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1 (Twist1) has been implicated in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis, due to its effects on cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis signaling. Interestingly, a connection between Twist1 and neurotoxicity was recently made in mutant huntingtin (mHtt)-expressing primary cortical neurons; however, the role of Twist1 in Huntington's disease (HD)-affected striatal neurons remains undescribed. In this study, we evaluated the expression and function of Twist1 in the R6/2 HD mouse model, which expresses the polyQ-expanded N-terminal portion of human HTT protein, and a pair of striatal progenitor cell lines (STHdhQ109 and STHdhQ7), which express polyQ-expanded or non-expanded full-length mouse Htt. We further probed upstream signaling events and Twist1 anti-apoptotic function in the striatal progenitor cell lines. Twist1 was increased in mHtt-expressing striatal progenitor cells (STHdhQ109) and was correlated with disease progression in striatum and cortex brain regions of R6/2 mice. In the cell model, downregulation of Twist1 induced death of STHdhQ109 cells but had no effect on wild-type striatal progenitor cells (STHdhQ7). Twist1 knockdown stimulated caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were increased in HD striatal progenitor cells and acted as an upstream regulator of Twist1. As such, inhibition of STAT3 induced apoptosis in HD striatal progenitor cells. Our results suggest that mHtt upregulates STAT3 to induce Twist1 expression. Upregulated Twist1 inhibits apoptosis, which may protect striatal cells from death during disease progression. Thus, we propose that Twist1 might play a protective role against striatal degeneration in HD.",Hui-Mei Chen;Yow-Sien Lin;Yijuang Chern;Yi-Ching Lee
201,Damien P Kuffler,"Injury typically results in the development of neuropathic pain, but the pain normally decreases and disappears in paralleled with wound healing. The pain results from cells resident at, and recruited to, the injury site releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators leading to the development of pro-inflammatory environment and causing nociceptive neurons to develop chronic ectopic electrical activity, which underlies neuropathic pain. The pain decreases as some of the cells that induce pro-inflammation, changing their phenotype leading to the blocking the release of pro-inflammatory mediators while releasing anti-inflammatory mediators, and blocking nociceptive neuron chronic spontaneous electrical activity. Often, despite apparent wound healing, the neuropathic pain becomes chronic. This raises the question of how chronic pain can be eliminated. While many of the cells and mediators contributing to the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain are known, a better understanding is required of how the injury site environment can be controlled to permanently eliminate the pro-inflammatory environment and silence the chronically electrically active nociceptive neurons. This paper examines how methods that can promote the transition of the pro-inflammatory injury site to an anti-inflammatory state, by changing the composition of local cell types, modifying the activity of pro- and anti-inflammatory receptors, inducing the release of anti-inflammatory mediators, and silencing the chronically electrically active nociceptive neurons. It also examines the hypothesis that factors released from platelet-rich plasma applied to chronic pain sites can permanently eliminate chronic inflammation and its associated chronic pain.",
202,Shi-Ying Fan,"OBJECTIVE
To compare the efficacy of subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on reducing levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease, and to explore the potential underlying mechanisms.


METHODS
We retrospectively assessed clinical outcomes in 43 patients with preoperative LID who underwent DBS targeting the STN (20/43) or GPi (23/43). The primary clinical outcome was the change from baseline in the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) and secondary outcomes included changes in the total daily levodopa equivalent dose, the drug-off Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part Ⅲ at the last follow-up (median, 18 months), adverse effects, and programming settings. Correlation analysis was used to find potential associated factors that could be used to predict the efficacy of DBS for dyskinesia management.


RESULTS
Compared to baseline, both the STN group and the GPi group showed significant improvement in LID with 60.73 ± 40.29% (mean ± standard deviation) and 93.78 ± 14.15% improvement, respectively, according to the UDysRS score. Furthermore, GPi-DBS provided greater clinical benefit in the improvement of dyskinesia (P < 0.05) compared to the STN. Compared to the GPi group, the levodopa equivalent dose reduction was greater in the STN group at the last follow-up (43.81% vs. 13.29%, P < 0.05). For the correlation analysis, the improvement in the UDysRS outcomes were significantly associated with a reduction in levodopa equivalent dose in the STN group (r = 0.543, P = 0.013), but not in the GPi group (r = -0.056, P = 0.801).


INTERPRETATION
Both STN and GPi-DBS have a beneficial effect on LID but GPi-DBS provided greater anti-dyskinetic effects. Dyskinesia suppression for STN-DBS may depend on the reduction of levodopa equivalent dose. Unlike the STN, GPi-DBS might exert a direct and independent anti-dyskinesia effect.",Kai-Liang Wang;Wei Hu;Robert S Eisinger;Alexander Han;Chun-Lei Han;Qiao Wang;Shimabukuro Michitomo;Jian-Guo Zhang;Feng Wang;Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora;Fan-Gang Meng

204,Thijs Vande Vyvere,"PURPOSE
To aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic value of using the NINDS standardized imaging-based pathoanatomic descriptors for the evaluation and reporting of acute TBI lesions.


METHODS
For a total of 3,392 patients (2,244 males and 1,148 females, Median = 51 years) enrolled in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study, we extracted 96 CDEs from the structured reports, spanning all three levels of pathoanatomic information (i.e. 20 ""basic"", 60 ""descriptive"" and 16 ""advanced"" CDE variables per patient). 6-month clinical outcome scores were dichotomized into favorable (GOS-E = 5-8) versus unfavorable (GOS-E = 1-4). Regularized logistic regression models were constructed and compared using the optimism-corrected AUC.


RESULTS
An abnormality was reported for the majority of patients (64.51%). In 79.11% of those patients, there was at least one coexisting pathoanatomic lesion or associated finding. An increase in lesion severity, laterality and volume was associated with more unfavorable outcomes. Compared to the full set of pathoanatomic descriptors (i.e. all three categories of information), reporting ""basic"" CDE information provides at least equal discrimination between patients with favorable versus unfavorable outcome (AUC = 0.8121 vs. 0.8155, respectively). Addition of a selected subset of ""descriptive"" detail (i.e. location and volume) to specific basic CDEs could improve outcome prediction (AUC = 0.8248). Addition of ""advanced"" or ""emerging"" information had minimal prognostic value.


CONCLUSION
Our results show that the NINDS standardized-imaging based pathoanatomic descriptors can be used in large-scale studies and provide important insights into acute TBI lesion patterns. When used in clinical predictive models, they can provide excellent discrimination between patients with favorable and unfavorable 6-month outcomes. If further validated, our findings could support the development of structured and itemized templates in routine clinical radiology.

205,Amin Adeli,"The aim of the current study was to determine the possible interaction of the central leptin and Glutamatergic systems on feeding behavior in neonatal 3-hours food deprived (FD3) broilers chickens. In experiment 1, FD3 chicken received intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of control solution (group i) and 2.5, 5 and 10 µg of Leptin (groups ii-iv). In experiment 2, FD3 chicken were ICV injected with (group i) control solution and groups ii-iv with 2.5, 5 and 10 nmol of AG-490 (JAK2 antagonist). In experiment 3, injections were (i) control solution, (ii) Leptin (10 µg), (iii) AG-490 (2.5 nmol) and (iv) Leptin + AG-490. In experiment 4, broiler chickens were ICV injected with (i) control solution, (ii) Leptin (10µg), (iii) MK-801 (NMDA glutamate receptors antagonist; 15nmol) and (iv) Leptin + MK-801. Experiments 5-9 were similar to experiment 1, except chicken were ICV injected with CNQX (AMPA receptor antagonist, 390nmol), UBP-302 (Kainate receptor antagonist, 390nmol), AIDA (mGluR1 antagonist, 2nmol), LY341495 (mGluR2 antagonist, 150nmol) and UBP1112 (mGluR3 antagonist, 2nmol) instead of MK-801. Then, food intake was measured until 120 minutes after injection. ICV injection of leptin (2.5, 5 and 10µg) significantly decreased food intake in a dose dependent manner (P < 0.05). Also, ICV injection of the JAK2 antagonist (2.5, 5 and 10 nmol) had hyperphagic effect in chicken(P < 0.05). Co-administration of leptin + AG-490, partially decreased leptin-induced hypophagia in broiler chicken (P < 0.05). In addition, co-injection of leptin + MK-801 significalty inhibited leptin-induced hypophagia in neonatal chicken (P < 0.05). Also, co-administration of leptin + CNQX partially attenuated hypophagic effect of leptin in chicken (P < 0.05).

NF-κB may be involved in the secondary injury of SCI that is mediated by inflammation and aggravates damage. Our study was aimed to investigate the role of NF-κB signaling in DUSP19-mediated cleaved Caspase-3 expression and the release of inflammatory factors in vivo and in vitro.Materials and Methods: DUSP19 mRNA expression and the content of IL-6 and IL-8 in patients with traumatic SCI (TSCI) were measured by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. The levels of p-NF-κBp65, NF-κBp65 and cleaved Caspase-3 expression and the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured by western blotting and ELISA, respectively.Results: Patients with TSCI showed lower DUSP19 expression and higher concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 compared with healthy controls. DUSP19 overexpression inhibited p-NF-κBp65 level, cleaved Caspase-3 expression, and production of IL-8 and IL-6 in the mice induced by TSCI. DUSP19 silencing increased p-NF-κBp65 level, cleaved Caspase-3 expression, and concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 in mouse primary microglia cells. DUSP19 overexpression had an inverse effect. Importantly, DUSP19 silencing and overexpression mediated p-NF-κBp65 level, cleaved Caspase-3 expression, and concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 in mouse primary microglia cells were reversed by NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and NF-κB activator 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), respectively.Conclusion: These results suggested that DUSP19-mediated SCI-induced apoptosis and inflammation via NF-κB signaling and might therefore serve as a potential therapeutic target for SCI.",Zheng-Kuan Xu;Kan Xu;Yu-Xiang Xiao
208,Pratik Parikh,"Advances in neonatology have led to unprecedented improvements in neonatal survival such that those born as early as 22 weeks of gestation now have some chance of survival, and over 70% of those born at 24 weeks of gestation survive. Up to 50% of infants born extremely preterm develop poor outcomes involving long-term neurodevelopmental impairments affecting cognition and learning, or motor problems such as cerebral palsy. Poor outcomes arise because the preterm brain is vulnerable both to direct injury (by events such as intracerebral hemorrhage, infection, and/or hypoxia), or indirect injury due to disruption of normal development. This neonatal brain injury and/or dysmaturation is called ""encephalopathy of prematurity"". Current and future strategies to improve outcomes in this population include prevention of preterm birth, and pre-, peri-, and postnatal approaches to protect the developing brain.

There are many similarities, with regards to brain lesions, for congenital Zika syndrome and congenital cytomegalovirus infection. Perinatally acquired viral infections tend to injure the white matter, with cystic evolution being more likely in the (late) preterm infant compared to the full-term infant.

211,Charbel El Kosseifi,"The new concept of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy is based on the understanding that many genetic epilepsies are associated with developmental impairment as a direct consequence of the genetic mutation, in addition to the effect of the frequent epileptic activity on brain development.

The term ""developmental and epileptic encephalopathy"" expresses the concept that the genetic defect may be responsible for both the epilepsy and adverse development which is crucial to understanding the disease process for both families and clinicians. The increased use of EEG monitoring, neuroimaging, and metabolic and genetic testing in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit has greatly improved our understanding of neonatal-onset epilepsies as seen with the syndromes Ohtahara and Early Myoclonic Encephalopathy outlined in the 1970s into distinct etiology-specific electroclinical phenotypes.",Marie-Coralie Cornet;Maria Roberta Cilio

Some perinatal strokes are symptomatic in the first days of life, typically with seizures, including neonatal arterial ischemic stroke, neonatal hemorrhagic stroke, and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. The remaining subtypes present in the first year of life or later, usually with motor asymmetry and include arterial presumed perinatal ischemic stroke, presumed perinatal hemorrhagic stroke, and in utero periventricular venous infarction.

The objective was to assess the long-term respiratory function evolution for periods On-Idebenone compared to periods Off-Idebenone in the same patients. The mean idebenone exposure in the EAPs was 4.2 (range 2.4-6.1) years. The primary endpoint was the annual change in forced vital capacity percent of predicted (FVC%p) compared between Off-Idebenone and On-Idebenone periods. The annual rate of decline in FVC%p was reduced by approximately 50% from -7.4% (95% CI: -9.1, -5.8) for the Off-Idebenone periods to -3.8% (95% CI: -4.8, -2.8) for the On-Idebenone periods (N = 11). Similarly, annual change in peak expiratory flow percent of predicted (PEF%p) was -5.9% (95% CI: -8.0, -3.9) for the Off-Idebenone periods (N = 9) and reduced to -1.9% (95% CI: -3.2, -0.7) for the On-Idebenone periods during the EAPs. The reduced rates of decline in FVC%p and PEF%p were maintained for several years with possible beneficial effects on the rate of bronchopulmonary adverse events, time to 10% decline in FVC%p and risk of hospitalization due to respiratory cause. These long-term data provide Class IV evidence to further support the disease modifying treatment effect of idebenone previously observed in randomized, controlled trials.",Chiara S M Straathof;Ulrike Schara;Andrea Klein;Mika Leinonen;Shabir Hasham;Thomas Meier;Liesbeth De Waele;Heather Gordish-Dressman;Craig M McDonald;Oscar H Mayer;Thomas Voit;Eugenio Mercuri;Gunnar M Buyse; 
219,Chan-Mi Kim,"Reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), an indicator of neurovascular processes and metabolic demands, is a common finding in Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about what contributes to CBF deficits in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We examine regional CBF differences in 17 MCI compared with 21 age-matched cognitively healthy older adults. Next, we examined associations between CBF, white matter lesion (WML) volume, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, and cortical thickness to better understand whether altered CBF was detectable before other markers and the potential mechanistic underpinnings of CBF deficits in MCI. MCI had significantly reduced CBF, whereas cortical thickness and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation were not affected. Reduced CBF was associated with the WML volume but not associated with other measures. Given the presumed vascular etiology of WML and relative worsening of vascular health in MCI, it may suggest CBF deficits result from early vascular as opposed to metabolic deficits in MCI. These findings may support vascular mechanisms as an underlying component of cognitive impairment.",Rachel L Alvarado;Kimberly Stephens;Hsiao-Ying Wey;Dany J J Wang;Elizabeth C Leritz;David H Salat
220,Alexander M Kulminski,"The role of even the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, in its etiology remains poorly understood. We examined molecular signatures of AD defined as differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns between AD-affected and -unaffected whites (2673/16,246), Hispanics (392/867), and African Americans (285/1789), separately. We focused on 29 polymorphisms from 5 genes in the APOE region emphasizing beneficial and adverse effects of the APOE ε2- and ε4-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively, and the differences in the linkage disequilibrium structures involving these alleles between AD-affected and -unaffected subjects. Susceptibility to AD is likely the result of complex interactions of the ε2 and ε4 alleles with other polymorphisms in the APOE region, and these interactions differ across races/ethnicities corroborating differences in the adverse and beneficial effects of the ε4 and ε2 alleles. Our findings support complex race/ethnicity-specific haplotypes promoting and protecting against AD in this region. They contribute to better understanding of polygenic and resilient mechanisms, which can explain why even homozygous ε4 carriers may not develop AD.",Leonardo Shu;Yury Loika;Alireza Nazarian;Konstantin Arbeev;Svetlana Ukraintseva;Anatoliy Yashin;Irina Culminskaya
221,Claire E Shepherd,"Clusterin (CLU) is a pleiotropic glycoprotein that exists as a secreted, neuroprotective or intracellular, neurotoxic form, both of which increase in Alzheimer's disease (AD) causing increased Aβ42 deposition. No studies have assessed the association between functionally distinct alloforms of CLU and tau protein or neuronal loss, despite its intracellular toxicity. We confirm previous reports of significant increases in both intracellular CLU and secreted CLU in the brain tissue of individuals with AD (p < 0.01) and show no association with neuronal loss. The increase in CLU alloforms was most closely associated with increases in both insoluble Aβ42 and tau protein (p = 0.001), supporting its role in AD pathogenesis.

222,Laura Bonfili,"Cerebral glucose homeostasis deregulation has a role in the pathogenesis and the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current therapies delay symptoms without definitively curing AD. We have previously shown that probiotics counteract AD progression in 3xTg-AD mice modifying gut microbiota and inducing energy metabolism and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis. Ameliorated cognition is based on higher neuroprotective gut hormones concentrations, reduced amyloid-β burden, and restored proteolytic pathways. Here, we demonstrate that probiotics oral administration improves glucose uptake in 3xTg-AD mice by restoring the brain expression levels of key glucose transporters (GLUT3, GLUT1) and insulin-like growth factor receptor β, in accordance with the diminished phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and protein-kinase B (Akt). In parallel, phosphorylated tau aggregates decrease in treated mice. Probiotics counteract the time-dependent increase of glycated hemoglobin and the accumulation of advanced glycation end products in AD mice, consistently with memory improvement. Collectively, our data elucidate the mechanism through which gut microbiota manipulation ameliorates impaired glucose metabolism in AD, finally delaying the disease progression.",Valentina Cecarini;Olee Gogoi;Sara Berardi;Silvia Scarpona;Mauro Angeletti;Giacomo Rossi;Anna Maria Eleuteri
223,Geoffrey Stanley,"The mammalian striatum is involved in many complex behaviors and yet is composed largely of a single neuron class: the spiny projection neuron (SPN). It is unclear to what extent the functional specialization of the striatum is due to the molecular specialization of SPN subtypes. We sought to define the molecular and anatomical diversity of adult SPNs using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and quantitative RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). We computationally distinguished discrete versus continuous heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data and found that SPNs in the striatum can be classified into four major discrete types with no implied spatial relationship between them. Within these discrete types, we find continuous heterogeneity encoding spatial gradients of gene expression and defining anatomical location in a combinatorial mechanism. Our results suggest that neuronal circuitry has a substructure at far higher resolution than is typically interrogated, which is defined by the precise identity and location of a neuron.",Ozgun Gokce;Robert C Malenka;Thomas C Südhof;Stephen R Quake
224,Sehyoun Yoon,"Variants in the ANK3 gene encoding ankyrin-G are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. However, no upstream regulators of ankyrin-G at synapses are known. Here, we show that ankyrin-G interacts with Usp9X, a neurodevelopmental-disorder-associated deubiquitinase (DUB). Usp9X phosphorylation enhances their interaction, decreases ankyrin-G polyubiquitination, and stabilizes ankyrin-G to maintain dendritic spine development. In forebrain-specific Usp9X knockout mice (Usp9X-/Y), ankyrin-G as well as multiple ankyrin-repeat domain (ANKRD)-containing proteins are transiently reduced at 2 but recovered at 12 weeks postnatally. However, reduced cortical spine density in knockouts persists into adulthood. Usp9X-/Y mice display increase of ankyrin-G ubiquitination and aggregation and hyperactivity. USP9X mutations in patients with intellectual disability and autism ablate its catalytic activity or ankyrin-G interaction.

226,Luca Marchetti,"Neurobiological underpinnings of treatment-resistant depression, a debilitating condition associated with significant functional impairment, have not been elucidated. Consequently, the aim of this study was to use animal models of response and resistance to antidepressant treatment, in an attempt to identify differences in associated transcriptional responses. Flinders Sensitive Line rats were subjected to maternal separation (MS) and chronically treated with Escitalopram or Nortriptyline. Antidepressants reduced immobility time in the forced swim test in non-MS rats, while lack of antidepressant behavioural response was observed in MS animals. We developed a novel bioinformatic algorithm that enabled identification of transcriptional signatures in hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex that discriminate vehicle- and antidepressant-treated subjects in both MS and non-MS rats. Functional annotation analysis showed that in antidepressant-responder rats the most enriched pathways included IQGAPs activation, toll-like receptor trafficking, energy metabolism, and regulation of endopeptidase activity. The analysis of interacting proteins implicated synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitter release, ubiquitin regulation, cytoskeleton organisation and carbohydrate metabolism. In contrast, in treatment-resistant MS rats, main expression changes were revealed in ribosomal proteins, inflammatory responses, transcriptional/epigenetic regulation, and small GTPases. Susceptibility signature shared Rtn1, Zdhhc5, Igsf6, and Sim1 genes with the latest depression GWAS meta-analysis, while antidepressant resistance signature shared Ctnnd1, Rbms3, Atp1a3, and Pla2r1 genes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that distinct transcriptional signatures are associated with behavioural response or non-response to antidepressant treatment. The identification of genes involved in antidepressant response will increase the comprehension of the neurobiological underpinnings of treatment-resistant depression, thus contributing to identification of novel therapeutic targets.",Mario Lauria;Laura Caberlotto;Laura Musazzi;Maurizio Popoli;Aleksander A Mathé;Enrico Domenici;Lucia Carboni

In the past 30 years, the absolute numbers of deaths and people with disabilities owing to neurological diseases have risen substantially, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, and further increases are expected globally as a result of population growth and ageing. This rise in absolute numbers of people affected suggests that advances in prevention and management of major neurological disorders are not sufficiently effective to counter global demographic changes. Urgent measures to reduce this burden are therefore needed.

228,Alfredo Ardila,"BACKGROUND
Cross-linguistic information about performance in neuropsychological verbal tests is extremely scarce. It has been suggested that verbal fluency test using animal fluency test is one of the few tests fulfilling the fundamental criteria desirable in a robust neuropsychological test.


OBJECTIVE
To compare and establish cross-linguistic information about performance in the animal fluency test.


RESULTS
In an extensive search, it was found that norms for the semantic fluency test using the category ANIMALS are available in 15 different languages. These languages represent a relatively broad spectrum of world languages, including not only Indo-European languages, but also Semitic, Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, Dravidian, and even Amerindian languages. Normative data in these 15 languages are analyzed and the results are compared.


CONCLUSIONS
It is concluded that (a) pure linguistic factors, such as type of language and word-length, seemingly do not significantly affect the performance in this test; (b) two major demographic variables-age and education-account for a significant percentage of the variance in this test; the effect of sex seems to be neglectable; (c) in bilinguals, when the native language has few speakers and/or is a marginalized language, a very low score can be observed in the native language, even lower than in the second language; (d) there is a frequently overlooked major factor accounting for differences in cognitive test performance: the effort made in performing the test. It depends on the significance given to the test performance. Effort is quite variable across cultures and is higher in psychometric-oriented societies.",
229,Kati Hagström,"OBJECTIVE
We assess behavioral and attentional problems and neurocognitive functioning in school-aged children with primary snoring (PS).


METHODS
Seventeen children with PS and 27 non-snoring peers aged 6-10 years took part in the study. All children underwent a polysomnography (PSG) at the Sleep Laboratory. Snoring was defined by parents and with PSG. Children with obstructive sleep apnea were excluded. The parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Parents and teachers assessed behavioral and attentional problems with the Child Behavior Checklist and the Conners' Rating Scale-Revised. Neuropsychological assessment included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY test).


RESULTS
The PS group had significantly more parent-reported internalizing, total, and attentional problems than the control group. Teachers did not report behavioral problems in the PS group. The PS and control groups had equal IQ scores and similar core neurocognitive functions, except for one visuospatial subtest. The PS group had significantly more inspiratory flow limitation and increased diaphragmatic electromyography compared with the controls. Parents reported significantly more daytime sleepiness in the PS group. Daytime sleepiness and snoring time were consistently associated with more behavioral and attentional problems. Flow limitation and more oxygen saturation values under 90% were associated with attentional problems, higher oxygen desaturation index, and lower mean oxygen saturation percentage with reduced language functions.


CONCLUSIONS
Snoring with an increase in respiratory effort without apneas and hypopneas and parent-reported daytime sleepiness may be linked to daytime symptoms. School-aged children with PS are at risk for behavioral and attentional problems, but not cognitive impairments.",Outi Saarenpää-Heikkilä;Sari-Leena Himanen;Anna-Maria Lampinlampi;Kati Rantanen
230,Sam Ng,"BACKGROUND
Therapeutic strategy concerning incidental low-grade glioma (ILGG) is still debated. Early ""prophylactic"" surgery has been proposed in asymptomatic patients with favorable neurological and oncological outcomes.


OBJECTIVE
To assess postoperative ability to resume employment following awake surgery in asymptomatic ILGG patients. To assess extent of resection (EOR), timeline for adjuvant oncological treatment, and survival.


METHODS
A total of 74 patients with ILGG who underwent awake surgery with intraoperative mapping were prospectively included, with a minimum follow-up of 12 mo. All clinicoradiological data were collected, and statistical correlations with return to work (RTW) were performed.


RESULTS
A total of 66 patients (97.1%) among 68 patients with preoperative professional activities resumed their employment including 62 (91.2%) within 12 mo. Mean time before RTW was 6.8 mo (median: 6 mo, range: 1-36). Two patients experienced seizure-related legal issues impacting their RTW. Clinicoradiological features did not correlate with RTW apart from postoperative seizures (P = .02). Mean EOR was 95.7%. A total of 43 patients (58.1%) underwent supratotal/total resections. All patients recovered from transient deficits at 3 mo. No patients received consecutive adjuvant treatment. A total of 24 patients (32.4%) were reoperated, 24 patients received chemotherapy, and 7 patients (9.5%) received radiotherapy, on average 73.1 mo after surgery. Mean follow-up was 67 mo (range 12-240). Four patients (5.4%) died during the follow-up.


CONCLUSION
We observed a high rate of RTW (97.1%, including 91.2% within 12 mo) after awake surgery in ILGG patients. Delayed resumption of work was due to employer not clearing them for RTW, personal choice, and, in rare occasions, related to seizures.",Guillaume Herbet;Sylvie Moritz-Gasser;Hugues Duffau
231,Robert A McGovern,"BACKGROUND
Technological improvements frequently outpace the publication of randomized, controlled trials in surgical patients. This makes the application of new surgical techniques difficult as surgeons solely use clinical experience to guide changes in their practice.


OBJECTIVE
To quantitatively examine the learning curve of incorporating new technology into a surgical technique and discuss the clinical significance of incorporating this new technology into daily practice. To identify areas of improvement for operative efficiency and safety.


METHODS
A retrospective observational study examining quantitative measures of operative efficiency and safety from 2009 to 2017 in 454 consecutive patients undergoing stereo-electroencephalography depth electrode implantations.


RESULTS
The transition to a new robotic technique significantly improved operative times (196 min [95% CI 173-219] vs 115 min [95% CI 111-118], P < .0001). Cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis demonstrated that mastery of the robotic technique took much longer than the frame-based technique (operative time peak at case 75 vs case 25, plateau of 150 vs 10 cases). Although hemorrhage rates using different vascular imaging techniques did not appear to differ using traditional statistical analysis (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI 22.3%, computed tomography angiography, CTA 17.9%, angiogram 18.1%, likelihood ratio χ2 = 4.84, P = .30), CUSUM analysis suggested MRI as the vascular imaging modality leading to higher hemorrhage and symptomatic hemorrhage rates at our center.


CONCLUSION
This experience demonstrates an improvement in operative efficiency through a series of changes made using clinical experience and intuition while transitioning to a completely new paradigm. CUSUM analysis identified potential areas for improvement in both operative efficiency and safety if used in a prospective manner.",Robert S Butler;James Bena;Jorge Gonzalez-Martinez

Spine surgery rates have increased and the high postoperative morbidity in these patients result in increased costs. Consequently, it is essential to identify patients at risk of adverse outcomes.


OBJECTIVE
To assess whether preoperative Timed Up and Go (TUG) test performance can predict high-grade postoperative complications.


METHODS
A prospective cohort study of patients undergoing elective thoracolumbar spine surgery in a tertiary care hospital between 2017 and 2018. Patients were assessed preoperatively and assigned to the slow-TUG group if unable to perform or test performance time was ≥18.4 s. Primary outcome: high-grade postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes: overall complications, length of stay (LOS), discharge to healthcare facility, readmission and emergency department (ED) presentation. Patients were followed-up until 6 wk after surgery.


RESULTS
One hundred three patients (mean age 62.95 ± 10.97 yr) were enrolled. Slow-TUG group were more likely to be classified as American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) class 3 (74.1% vs 47.4%, P = .02), non-independent (25.9% vs 5.3%, P < .01), and frail (92.3% vs 42.1%, P < .01). TUG was an independent predictor of high-grade complications (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 4.97, 95% CI: 1.18-22.47), overall complications (OR: 3.77, 95% CI: 1.33-11.81), discharge to a skilled-nursing facility (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.00-10.70), readmission within 6 wk of surgery (OR: 9.14, 95% CI: 2.39-41.26) and LOS (adjusted incident rate ratio (IRR): 1.45, 95% CI: 1.16-1.80).

233,Natascia De Lucia,"OBJECTIVE
Patients with Huntington's disease (HD) may show impairments of frontal cortical-subcortical circuits with difficulties on cognitive flexibility tasks. One marker of poor flexibility is ""perseveration"" behavior, which refers to inappropriate and involuntary production of iterative responses not adequate to the current task demands. This study explored frequency, type, and possible cognitive mechanisms of verbal perseverations in a large sample of HD patients.


METHOD
A sample of 128 patients with HD underwent phonological and category verbal fluency tests to assess perseverative errors, within a wide neuropsychological, psychopathological, motor, and functional assessment.


RESULTS
Perseverative errors in verbal fluency task occurred in 89 (69.5%) patients. Patients showing perseverations scored significantly lower than patients without perseverations on tasks tapping executive and motor functions and on functional independence scales. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant independent association of verbal perseverations with scores on Trail Making Test only. Conclusions: Verbal perseverations are frequent in HD patients and are likely related with impairments of attentional switching and working memory, hampering tracking of verbal responses already produced. Perseverative behavior may serve as a useful clinical marker of cognitive and functional impairment in patients with HD.",Silvio Peluso;Alessandro Roca;Giuseppe De Michele;Luigi Trojano;Elena Salvatore

Stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) is a minimally invasive neurosurgical method to localize epileptogenic brain regions in epilepsy but requires days in the hospital with interventions to trigger several seizures.


OBJECTIVE
To make initial progress in the development of network analysis methods to identify epileptogenic brain regions using brief, resting-state SEEG data segments, without requiring seizure recordings.


METHODS
In a cohort of 15 adult focal epilepsy patients undergoing SEEG, we evaluated functional connectivity (alpha-band imaginary coherence) across sampled regions using brief (2 min) resting-state data segments. Bootstrapped logistic regression was used to generate a model to predict epileptogenicity of individual regions.


RESULTS
Compared to nonepileptogenic structures, we found increased functional connectivity within epileptogenic regions (P < .05) and between epileptogenic areas and other structures (P < .01, paired t-tests, corrected). Epileptogenic areas also demonstrated higher clustering coefficient (P < .01) and betweenness centrality (P < .01), and greater decay of functional connectivity with distance (P < .05, paired t-tests, corrected). Our functional connectivity model to predict epileptogenicity of individual regions demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.78 and accuracy of 80.4%.

235,Juan C Fernandez-Miranda,"A 2-yr-old patient with a giant craniopharyngioma presented with seizures and panhypopituitarism. The lesion was initially approached at an outside institution with a transfrontal cyst fenestration, but progressive growth occurred later. Multiple management options were considered; we recommended an endoscopic endonasal approach with the goal of maximal safe resection. Virtual reality simulation and 3-dimensional printing were employed to evaluate whether the absence of pneumatization of the sinuses and the overall size of the nasal cavity could preclude effective surgical access. Our lab results suggested the binostril approach was feasible. A wide surgical exposure was performed from planum sphenoidale to clivus and from orbit to orbit. After removing the large calcified tumor portion, we found an accurate plane of dissection between tumor capsule, hypothalami, and visual pathways. By the end of resection, arterial bleeding was encountered secondary to an avulsion of the posterior communicating artery from the posterior cerebral artery. An angled aneurysm clip was placed with a single-shaft applier to secure the site of injury without narrowing the parent artery. Immediate and delayed magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography studies showed gross total resection, no stroke, and no pseudoaneurysm formation. On postoperative day 9, patient developed neurological decline and pneumocephalus secondary to necrotic nasoseptal flap. Two endonasal repairs with a lateral nasal wall flap were attempted with no success. A temporoparietal fascia flap was then harvested and transposed from the temporal to the pterygopalatine fossa to successfully repair the skull base defect.

To radiographically assess cervical spine clearance in unconscious pediatric trauma patients.


METHODS
A retrospective cohort study was conducted to review pediatric patients with suspected cervical spinal injuries between 2005 and 2018 at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All pediatric patients aged 15 years and less, who sustained trauma (motor vehicle accident, pedestrian, fall, all-terrain vehicle accident, and sports injures) and were intubated at the scene or in the emergency department, were included.


RESULTS
A total of 62 patients were included. The average age for children was 8 ± 3.9 years. The average Glasgow coma scale (GCS) for children at initial trauma was 7.6 + 3.7. The average injury severity score (ISS) was 24.1 + 17.7. The most frequent abnormal finding identified on CT scan was cervical spine straightening (N = 8; 13.1%). A total of 13 children had abnormal MRI findings, with the most common injury being ligamentous in nature (N = 13; 46.42%). The sensitivity and specificity of CT scan in cervical spine clearance in unconscious children are 84.8% and 100%, respectively.


CONCLUSION
Utilizing CT scans in clearing the cervical spine is of paramount importance to promptly detect possible injuries. The role of MRI in cervical spine clearance still cannot be undervalued, especially when the clinical suspicion for injury is high.",Jawaher Alwatban;Ali Alkhaibary;Yaser Babgi;Waleed Al-Mohamadi;Emad M Masuadi;Ibrahim Al Babtain;Moutasem Azzubi
238,Federica Ginanneschi,"BACKGROUND
Spastic paraplegia type 8 (SPG8) is an autosomal-dominant form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP) caused by a mutation in the KIAA0196 gene. SPG8 accounts for 1% of less of all AD-HSP and the genotype-phenotype correlation remains poorly understood.


METHODS
We report the first clinical and genetic description of SPG8 disease in Italian patients. We identified four new mutations in KIAA0196 gene. These variants were identified using a multigene targeted resequencing HSP panel. We took this opportunity to review the pertinent literature.


RESULTS
Age at disease onset was in the third or fourth decade of life. Stiffness of the lower limb with spastic gait, walking impairment, and decreased vibration sense were common early symptoms. Subjects of two families had bladder control abnormalities. Unlike previous reported cases, Italian SPG8 subjects have pure form of spastic paraparesis without cranial nerve involvement, and onset is in adult life.


DISCUSSION
By a clinical point of view, it is hard to differentiate SPG8 from the SPG4, in which bladder and vibration sense dysfunctions are frequent signs. The differential diagnosis with other forms of AD-HSPs seems relatively easier if one considers the early-onset manifestations in SPG3A and the peripheral nervous system and cerebellar involvement seen in SPG31.",Angelica D'Amore;Melissa Barghigiani;Alessandra Tessa;Alessandro Rossi;Filippo Maria Santorelli

To examine the consequences of antiepileptic drug (AED) exposure during pregnancy on language abilities in children of mothers with epilepsy aged 5 and 8 years.


METHODS
The study population included children of mothers with and without epilepsy enrolled in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study 1999-2008. Mothers prospectively provided information on epilepsy diagnosis, AED use during pregnancy, and the child's language abilities at age 5 and 8 years, in questionnaires with validated language screening tools. We measured AED concentrations in gestation week 17-19 and the umbilical cord.


RESULTS
The study population included 346 AED-exposed and 388 AED-unexposed children of mothers with epilepsy, and 113,674 children of mothers without epilepsy. Mothers of 117 and 121 AED-exposed children responded to the questionnaires at age 5 and 8 years, respectively. For AED-exposed children, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for language impairment was 1.6 (CI 1.1-2.5, p=0.03) at age 5 years and 2.0 (CI 1.4-3.0, p<0.001) at age 8 years, compared to children of mothers without epilepsy. Children exposed to carbamazepine monotherapy had a significantly increased risk of language impairment compared to control children at age 8 years (aOR 3.8, CI 1.6-9.0, p=0.002). Higher maternal valproate concentrations correlated with language impairment at age 5 years. Periconceptional folic acid supplement use protected against AED-associated language impairment.


CONCLUSION
Fetal AED exposure in utero is associated with an increased risk of language impairment in children of mothers with epilepsy aged 5 and 8 years.

Autoimmune encephalitides (AE) include a spectrum of neurological disorders, whose diagnosis revolves around the detection of neuronal antibodies (Abs). Consensus-based diagnostic criteria (AE-DC) allow clinic-serological subgrouping of AE, with unclear prognostic implications. We studied AE-DC impact on patients' management, focusing on the subgroup of Ab-negative-AE.


METHODS
Retrospective multicenter study on patients fulfilling AE-DC. All patients underwent Ab testing with commercial cell-based-assays (CBAs) and, when available, in-house assays (immunohistochemistry, live/fixed CBAs, neuronal cultures), that contributed to define final categories. Patients were classified as Ab-positive-AE [NMDAR-encephalitis (NMDAR-E), Ab-positive limbic encephalitis (LE), definite-AE], or Ab-negative-AE (Ab-negative-LE, probable-AE, possible-AE).


RESULTS
Commercial CBAs detected neuronal Abs in 70/118(59.3%) patients. Testing 37/48 Ab-negative cases, in-house assays identified Abs in 11 patients (29.7%). One-hundred-eighteen patients fulfilled AE-DC, 81(68.6%) with Ab-positive-AE (Ab-positive-LE, 40; NMDAR-E, 32; definite-AE, 9), 37(31.4%) with Ab-negative-AE (Ab-negative-LE, 17; probable/possible-AE, 20). Clinical phenotypes were similar in Ab-positive- vs Ab-negative-LE. Twenty-four/118(20.3%) patients had tumors, and 19/118(16.1%) relapsed, regardless of being Ab-positive or Ab-negative. Ab-positive-AE patients were treated earlier than Ab-negative-AE patients (p=0.045), responded more frequently to treatments (92.3% vs 65.6%, p<0.001), and received second-line therapies more often (33.3% vs 10.8%, p=0.01). Delays in first-line therapy initiation associated with poor response (p=0.022; OR,1.02; CI,1.00-1.04).


CONCLUSIONS
In-house diagnostics improved Ab detection, allowing better patients' management, but was available in a patient subgroup only, implying possible Ab-positive-AE underestimation. Notwithstanding this limitation, our findings suggest that Ab-negative-AE and Ab-positive-AE share similar oncologic profiles, warranting appropriate tumor screening. Ab-negative-AE patients risk worse responses due to delayed and less aggressive treatments.",S Mariotto;M P Giannoccaro;R Iorio;M Zoccarato;M Nosadini;L Benedetti;S Casagrande;M Di Filippo;M Valeriani;S Ricci;S Bova;C Arbasino;M Mauri;M Versino;F Vigevano;L Papetti;M Romoli;C Lapucci;F Massa;S Sartori;L Zuliani;A Barilaro;P De Gaspari;G Spagni;A Evoli;R Liguori;S Ferrari;E Marchioni;B Giometto;L Massacesi;D Franciotta
242,Anisha Lynch-Godrei,"BACKGROUND
Dystonia musculorum (Dstdt ) is a murine disease caused by recessive mutations in the dystonin (Dst) gene. Loss of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, ataxia, and dystonic postures before death by postnatal day 18 (P18) is a hallmark feature. Recently we observed gas accumulation and discoloration in the small intestine and cecum in Dstdt mice by P15. The human disease resulting from dystonin loss-of-function, known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type VI (HSAN-VI), has also been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain. As neuronal dystonin isoforms are expressed in the GI tract, we hypothesized that dystonin loss-of-function in Dstdt-27J enteric nervous system (ENS) neurons resulted in neurodegeneration associated with the GI abnormalities.


METHODS
We characterized the nature of the GI abnormalities observed in Dstdt mice through histological analysis of the gut, assessing the ENS for signs of neurodegeneration, evaluation of GI motility and absorption, and by profiling the microbiome.


KEY RESULTS
Though gut histology, ENS viability, and GI absorption were normal, slowed GI motility, thinning of the colon mucous layer, and reduced microbial richness/evenness were apparent in Dstdt-27J mice by P15. Parasympathetic GI input showed signs of neurodegeneration, while sympathetic did not.


CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES
Dstdt-27J GI defects are not linked to ENS neurodegeneration, but are likely a result of an imbalance in autonomic control over the gut. Further characterization of HSAN-VI patient GI symptoms is necessary to determine potential treatments targeting symptom relief.",Yves De Repentigny;Rebecca A Yaworski;Sabrina Gagnon;James Butcher;Juliana Manoogian;Alain Stintzi;Rashmi Kothary
243,Christoph Schroeder,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Transorbital sonography (TOS) emerged as promising imaging method for the diagnosis and follow-up of acute optic neuritis (ON). Available studies report increase in the optic nerve diameter (OND) and optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in case of first episode of ON in the affected eye compared to either the contralateral unaffected eye or controls. However, the utility of TOS in case of recurrent episodes of ON has never been assessed.


METHODS
In our prospective cohort study we assessed the diagnostic utility of TOS in patients with demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, and examined further the association between TOS, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs).


RESULTS
We included 78 patients with history of demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system (mean age:38.2±14.2 years; 24% with acute ON). No differences in the OND (3.2±0.5mm vs. 3.2±0.4mm) and ONSD (5.1±0.8mm vs. 5.1±0.7mm) measurements were found between patients with and without acute ON. Papillary swelling was more frequent in patients with acute ON (14.2% vs. 1.5%,p=0.002). Patients with history of previous ON were found to have lower OND (p<0.001), and ONSD (p=0.007) compared to patients without history of previous ON. TOS measurements were inversely associated with disease duration and positively correlated with OCT findings. No association with VEP measurements was found.


CONCLUSION
We found no evidence for TOS-sensitive differences in the OND and ONSD of patients with demyelinating diseases, according to the presence of acute ON. The association between TOS and OCT measurements deserves further investigation.",Aristeidis H Katsanos;Ilya Ayzenberg;Carolin Schwake;Anna Gahlen;Georgios Tsivgoulis;Konstantinos Voumvourakis;Ralf Gold;Christos Krogias

Previous studies reported conflicting results regarding possible anticipation in familial E200K Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD).


OBJECTIVES
To use a large database to assess age of disease onset (AODO) in CJD.


METHODS
The study population included 477 CJD patients (266 with fCJD,145 with sporadic CJD (sCJD) and 66 patients of Libyan origin but negative family history) from the Israeli registry of CJD conducted since 1954. In all patients AODO in relatives and family trees were documented. Comparison of AODO was done using paired t-test and regression using Pearson correlation for birth and year of onset.


RESULTS
Initial analysis in 52/73 families in which more than one generation was affected revealed an AODO of 63.30 ± 9.44 in the first generation compared to 56.96 ± 8.99 in the second generation (p < 0.001). However, inspection of individual AODO plotted by year of birth showed a clear rhomboid methodological artifact generated by missing data of many young onset CJD patients who died before the database began to function in 1954 and of many late onset CJD patients missing at the present time since they will only develop the disease in the future. The ""generation"" effect completely disappears if analysis is performed by year of disease onset or for the periods in which complete data is available.


CONCLUSIONS
In this very large data set we did not detect true anticipation in fCJD patients. It is plausible that previous reports supporting the presence of anticipation are biased by a rhomboid shaped data availability artifact.",Ester Kahana;Amos D Korczyn;Tomer Ziv-Baran;Zeev Nitsan;Shmuel Appel;Hanna Rosenmann;Joab Chapman

As an extension of a phase 2/3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) 30, 50, or 70 mg/d for 4 weeks in Japanese patients aged 6-17 years with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), this study evaluated its long-term safety and efficacy.


METHODS
This was a multicenter, open-label study of LDX for 53 weeks. Safety was assessed by regular medical examination for treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); regular recording of body weight, vital signs, and laboratory test values; and completion of dependence questionnaires. Efficacy was assessed using Japanese versions of the ADHD-Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) and Conners' 3rd edition Parent Rating Scale (Conners 3); plus Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I), Clinical Global Impression-Severity, and Parent Global Assessment (PGA) scales.


RESULTS
Of 132 enrolled patients, 104 completed the trial. Most frequent treatment-related TEAEs were decreased appetite (73.5%), initial insomnia (39.4%), and weight decrease (22.0%). Most TEAEs were mild (82.6% of patients). There were no serious or severe TEAEs or deaths. No treatment-related TEAEs were associated with blood pressure or pulse rate, and no patient had a QTcF interval >500 ms. Statistically significant improvement from baseline to week 53 was observed in the mean ADHD-Rating Scale-IV total score and mean Conners 3 subscale scores. Most patients showed improvement on the CGI-I (78%) and PGA (76.5%) scales.


CONCLUSIONS
No significant safety issues were observed with LDX 30, 50, or 70 mg/d administered for 1 year in Japanese children and adolescents with ADHD.

246,Qiao Wang,"BACKGROUND
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common movement disorder for which diagnosis mainly depends on the medical history and clinical symptoms. Exosomes are now considered an additional mechanism for intercellular communication, allowing cells to exchange proteins, lipids, and genetic material. Long noncoding (lnc) RNA in exosomes plays a critical role in many diseases, including neurodegenerative disease.


AIM
To study expression differences for lncRNAs in peripheral blood exosomes of PD patients compared with healthy individuals and to look for lncRNAs that might be related to the pathogenesis of PD.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We recruited PD patients along with age- and sex-matched healthy individuals as healthy controls and evaluated levels of lncRNAs extracted from exosomes in plasma samples via next-generation sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR. Correlation analysis was conducted for the clinical characteristics of PD patients and the expression of selected lncRNAs.


RESULTS
We found 15 upregulated and 24 downregulated exosomal lncRNAs in the PD group. According to bioinformatics analyses, we chose lnc-MKRN2-42:1 for further study. Interestingly, lnc-MKRN2-42:1 was positively correlated with the MDS-UPDRS III score for PD patients.


CONCLUSION
Our study suggested that lnc-MKRN2-42:1 may be involved in the occurrence and development of PD.",Chun-Lei Han;Kai-Liang Wang;Yun-Peng Sui;Zhi-Bao Li;Ning Chen;Shi-Ying Fan;Michitomo Shimabukuro;Feng Wang;Fan-Gang Meng
247,Marisa I Mendes,"OBJECTIVE
Biallelic variants in RARS1, encoding the cytoplasmic tRNA synthetase for arginine (ArgRS), cause a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. This study aimed to investigate clinical, neuroradiological and genetic features of patients with RARS1-related disease, and to identify possible genotype-phenotype relationships.


METHODS
We performed a multinational cross-sectional survey among 20 patients with biallelic RARS1 variants identified by next-generation sequencing techniques. Clinical data, brain MRI findings and genetic results were analyzed. Additionally, ArgRS activity was measured in fibroblasts of four patients, and translation of long and short ArgRS isoforms was quantified by western blot.


RESULTS
Clinical presentation ranged from severe (onset in the first 3 months, usually with refractory epilepsy and early brain atrophy), to intermediate (onset in the first year with nystagmus and spasticity), and mild (onset around or after 12 months with minimal cognitive impairment and preserved independent walking). The most frequent RARS1 variant, c.5A>G, led to mild or intermediate phenotypes, whereas truncating variants and variants affecting amino acids close to the ArgRS active centre led to severe phenotypes. ArgRS activity was significantly reduced in three patients with intermediate and severe phenotypes; in a fourth patient with intermediate to severe presentation, we measured normal ArgRS activity, but found translation mainly of the short instead of the long ArgRS isoform.


INTERPRETATION
Variants in RARS1 impair ArgRS activity and do not only lead to a classic hypomyelination presentation with nystagmus and spasticity, but to a wide spectrum, ranging from severe, early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with brain atrophy to mild disease with relatively preserved myelination.",Lydia M C Green;Enrico Bertini;Davide Tonduti;Chiara Aiello;Desiree Smith;Ettore Salsano;Shanice Beerepoot;Jozef Hertecant;Sarah von Spiczak;John H Livingston;Lisa Emrick;Jamie Fraser;Laura Russell;Genevieve Bernard;Stefania Magri;Daniela Di Bella;Franco Taroni;Mary K Koenig;Isabella Moroni;Gerarda Cappuccio;Nicola Brunetti-Pierri;Jullie Rhee;Bryce A Mendelsohn;Ingo Helbig;Katherine Helbig;Hiltrud Muhle;Omar Ismayl;Adeline L Vanderver;Gajja S Salomons;Marjo S van der Knaap;Nicole I Wolf

This study investigated the safety and efficacy of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) on ameliorating the sequelae of ischemic moyamoya disease (iMMD).


METHODS
A total of 30 iMMD patients underwent long-term RIC and were followed up at 0.5, 1, and 2 years for clinical outcomes, including frequency of stroke recurrence, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale, peak systolic velocities (PSV), and cerebral perfusion.


RESULTS
During the whole RIC treatment process, no RIC-related adverse event occurred. Only one of 30 patients suffered a onetime infarction (3.3%), and the ratios of acceptable PGIC were 88.2%, 64.3%, and 92.3% at 0.5, 1, and 2 years follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed the frequency of stroke recurrence was significantly reduced after RIC (P = .013). The frequency of TIA per week was 1.1 (0.6, 2.8) prior to RIC and 0.1 (0.0, 0.5) post-RIC (P < .01). Compared to baseline, PSV values were significantly reduced after RIC treatment (P = .002 at 0.5, P = .331 at 1, and P = .006 at 2 years). In patients undergoing perfusion studies, 75% obtained improvement on followed-up SPECT and 95% on followed-up PET maps.

249,Yuanbin Ru,"OBJECTIVE
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2 disease) is a rare, progressive, fatal neurodegenerative pediatric disorder resulting from deficiencies of the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 that are caused by mutations in TPP1. Identifying biomarkers of CLN2 disease progression will be important in assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for this disorder. Neurofilament light is an intrinsic component of healthy neurons; elevated circulating extracellular neurofilament light is a biomarker of neuropathology in several adult-onset neurological diseases. Our objective was to assess whether circulating neurofilament light is a biomarker that is responsive to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in CLN2 disease.


METHODS
Using an ultrasensitive immunoassay, we assessed plasma neurofilament light changes during disease progression in a canine model of CLN2 disease and in ERT clinical trial CLN2 disease patients.


RESULTS
In tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1)-null dogs (N = 11), but not in control dogs [N = 6 (TPP1+/- ) and N = 27 (WT)], neurofilament light levels increased more than tenfold above initial low baseline levels during disease progression. Before treatment in 21 human subjects with CLN2 disease (age range: 1.72-6.85 years), neurofilament light levels were 48-fold higher (P < 0.001) than in 7 pediatric controls (age range: 8-11 years). Pretreatment neurofilament light did not significantly correlate with disease severity or age. In CLN2 disease subjects receiving ERT, neurofilament light levels decreased by 50% each year over more than 3 years of treatment.


INTERPRETATION
Our data indicate that circulating neurofilament light is a treatment-responsive biomarker in CLN2 disease and could contribute to understanding of the pathophysiology of this devastating pediatric disorder.",Carley Corado;Russell K Soon;Andrew C Melton;Adam Harris;Guoying K Yu;Nancy Pryer;John R Sinclair;Martin L Katz;Temitayo Ajayi;David Jacoby;Chris B Russell;Sanjay Chandriani

Sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) and the signaling molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are known to be key regulators of a variety of important biological processes, such as neovascularization. Nitric oxide (NO) is also known to play a role in vasoactive properties, whether Sphk1/S1P signaling is able to alter angiogenesis in the context of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and whether such activity is linked with NO production, however, remains uncertain.


METHODS
We used immunofluorescence to detect the expression of Sphk1 and NOS in cerebral epithelial cells (EC) after IR or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGDR). Western blotting was used to detect the Sphk1 and NOS protein levels in brain tissues or HBMECs. Adenovirus transfection was used to inhibit Sphk1 and NOS. An NO kit was used to detect NO contents in brain tissues and epithelial cells. Tube formation assays were conducted to measure angiogenesis.


RESULTS
We determined that EC used in a model of cerebral IRI expressed Sphk1, and that inhibiting this expression led to decreased expression of two isoforms of NO synthase (eNOS and iNOS), as well as to decrease neovascularization density and NO production following injury. In HBMECs, knocking down Sphk1 markedly reduced NO production owing to reduced eNOS activity, and inhibiting eNOS directly similarly decreased NO production in a manner which could be reversed via exogenously treating cells with S1P. We further found that knocking down Sphk1 reduced HBMEC eNOS expression, in addition to decreasing the adhesion, migration, and tube formation abilities of these cells under OGDR conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
Based on these results, we therefore postulate that Sphk1/S1P signaling is able to mediate angiogenesis following cerebral IRI via the regulation of eNOS activity and NO production. As such, targeting these pathways may potentially represent a novel means of improving patient prognosis in those suffering from cerebral IRI.",Shi Li;Yong-Jia Jiang;Wei Zhang

This study was conducted to investigate the short-term behavioral and neurophysiological effects of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) on tinnitus perception.


METHODS
A double-blind randomized controlled cross-over design. Part 1. Behavioural measures of tinnitus following 30 mg MDMA or placebo administration (N = 5 participants) and Part 2. Behavioral measures of tinnitus and correlations between pairs of apriori regions of interest (ROI) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) before and after 70 mg of MDMA or placebo (N = 8 participants).


RESULTS
The results to MDMA were similar to placebo. For the 70 mg dose there was a significant reduction after 4 hours in annoyance and ignore ratings. RsMRI showed decreased connectivity compared to placebo administration between the left hippocampal, right hippocampal, left amygdala and right amygdala regions, and between the right posterior parahippocampal cortex and the left amygdala after two hours of 70 mg MDMA administration. Increased connectivity compared to placebo administration was found post MDMA between the right post-central gyrus and right posterior and superior temporal gyrus, and between the thalamus and frontoparietal network.


CONCLUSIONS
Following 70 mg of MDMA two tinnitus rating scales significantly improved. There was, however, a placebo effect. Compared to placebo the rsMRI following the MDMA showed reductions in connectivity between the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus.

254,Gürsel Çalışkan,"Introduction: Phytoestrogens are non-steroidal estrogen analogues and are found primarily in soy products. They have received increasing attention as dietary supplements for estrogen deficiency and as modulators of endogenous estrogen functions, including cognition and emotion. In addition to modifying the levels of circulating sex hormones, phytoestrogens also exert direct effects on estrogen and androgen receptors in the brain and thus effectively modulate the neural circuit functions.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of low phytoestrogen intake (∼6 weeks) on the hippocampal plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory formation in the adult C57BL/6 male mice.Methods and Results: In comparison to mice on a diet with normal phytoestrogen content, mice on low phytoestrogen diet showed a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of NR2B subunit, a molecular correlate of plasticity in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse. We observed a profound decrease in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the ventral hippocampus, whereas no effect on plasticity was evident in its dorsal portion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that acute perfusion of slices with an estrogen analogue equol, an isoflovane metabolized from daidzein produced by the bacterial flora in the gut, was able to rescue the observed LTP deficit. Examining potential behavioral correlates of the plasticity attenuation, we found that mice on phytoestrogen-free diet display decreased contextual fear memory at remote but not at recent time points after training.Conclusions: Our data suggests that nutritional phytoestrogens have profound effects on the plasticity in the ventral hippocampus and ventral hippocampus-dependent memory.",Syed Ahsan Raza;Yunus E Demiray;Emre Kul;Kiran V Sandhu;Oliver Stork

Investigation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is somewhat dependent on addressing main core features of ASD. But it is not clear which kind of investigation can effect on more difficulties features. So, this study examines the effect of the visuomotor, motor, and computer-based training programs on social behavior, motor skills, and repetitive behaviors of children with ASD.


Patients and methods
Sixty children with ASD aged 6-12 years were recruited and assigned to one of the three experimental groups and the control group (each group n=15). Training was provided in 30 sessions, scheduled 3 times a week. Social behavior and repetitive behaviors were determined objectively using the observation method, and motor skills were evaluated by the Test of Gross Motor Development-2.


Results
Our results suggested that children in the visuomotor group showed a significant reduction in the repetitive behaviors and an increase in gross motor skill scores in the post-test and follow-up. Also, the results exhibited that motor training group significantly improved in social behavior either in the post-test or follow-up. Although the post-test illustrated a considerable improvement of gross motor skills, this difference was not significant in follow-up. Similarly, no significant change was observed in visual training and control groups in relation to study variables.


Conclusion
Given the improvement of repetitive behaviors and gross motor skills in post-test and follow-up, it seems that this investigation had a positive effect with a good retention effect on two core features of children with ASD. But according to group-based training protocol in motor training group and improvement in social communication, and mutual effect on gross motor skills, it seems that group-based practice can also be used to achieve the benefits of social communication in the investigations.",Alireza Saberi Kakhki;Mehdi Sohrabi;Sakineh Soltani Kouhbanani;Mehdi Jabbari Nooghabi
256,Davide Palumbo,"Introduction
The Computerized Interactive Remediation of Cognition - Training for Schizophrenia (CIRCuiTS) is a form of cognitive remediation therapy developed to target neurocognitive and metacognitive deficits of people with schizophrenia, which have a detrimental impact on real-life functioning. The English version of CIRCuiTS demonstrated good acceptability and feasibility. A recent randomized controlled trial provided evidence that the program improves memory and functioning, and that the impact on functional outcome is mediated by metacognition. The next steps in the development of CIRCuiTS include both: 1) the translation and adaptation of the program in different cultural settings; and 2) the demonstration of feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of a standardized method to administer CIRCuiTS remotely.


Purpose
To implement the CIRCuiTS Italian version and to assess acceptability, feasibility and efficacy of a standardized method to administer CIRCuiTS remotely.


Methods
Participants were assessed at baseline and received up to 40 CIRCuiTS therapy sessions, three times a week, for about 1 hr over a three-month period. Participants were reassessed post-treatment.


Results
The program demonstrated good feasibility and high acceptability when assessed by the number of dropouts and evaluation of patients' satisfaction. Participants improved in learning, speed of processing, working memory and executive control. They showed a reduction in disorganization and improvement in self-esteem, functional capacity, and real-life functioning.


Conclusion
In this study, a standardized protocol for using CIRCuiTS from home was implemented. The first set of data showed in the paper is encouraging.

257,Qiong Wu,"Purpose
Clinical trials have illustrated that Shenmayizhi decoction (SMYZ) could improve the cognitive functions in patients with dementia. However, the mechanism needs to be explored.


Methods
Fifty adult male rats (Wistar strain) were divided into five groups equally and randomly, including control, model, and SMYZ of low dose, medium dose and high dose. Rats in each group received a daily gavage of respective treatment. Rats in control and model group were administrated by the same volume of distilled water. Memory impairment was induced by intraperitoneal administration of scopolamine (0.7 mg/kg) for 5 continuous days. Four weeks later, Morris water maze (MWM) was performed to evaluate the spatial memory in all rats. Then, rats were sacrificed and the hippocampus was removed for further tests. Furthermore, Western blot analysis was employed to assess the levels of acetylcholine M1 receptor (M1), acetylcholine M2 receptor (M2), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT). AChE and ChAT activities were determined.


Results
The SMYZ decoction significantly improved behavioral performance of rats in high dose. The SMYZ decoction in three doses exhibited anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. In addition, a high dose of SMYZ promoted ChAT activity. Moreover, a high dose of SMYZ increased the level of ChAT and declined the level of AChE assessed by Western blotting. Besides, an increased level of M1 receptor was found after treatment.


Conclusion
Shenmayizhi decoction could mitigate scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits through the preventative effect on cholinergic system dysfunction.",Yu Cao;Meixia Liu;Fang Liu;Adelheid H Brantner;Yang Yang;Yun Wei;Yu Zhou;Zhiyong Wang;Lina Ma;Feixue Wang;Hui Pei;Hao Li

The associations between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and dementias are as yet to be studied in Taiwan. The aim of this study is to clarify as to whether HIV infections are associated with the risk of dementia.


Methods
A total of 1,261 HIV-infected patients and 3,783 controls (1:3) matched for age and sex were selected between January 1 and December 31, 2000 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Fine and Gray's survival analysis (competing with mortality) analyzed the risk of dementias during the 15-year follow up. The association between the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and dementia was analyzed by stratifying the HAART status among the HIV subjects.


Results
During the follow-up period, 25 in the HIV group (N= 1,261) and 227 in the control group (N= 3,783) developed dementia (656.25 vs 913.15 per 100,000 person-years). Fine and Gray's survival analysis revealed that the HIV patients were not associated with an increased risk of dementia, with the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) as 0.852 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.189-2.886, p=0.415) after adjusting for sex, age, comorbidities, geographical region, and the urbanization level of residence. There was no significant difference between the two groups of HIV-infected patients with or without HAART in the risk of dementia.


Conclusion
This study found that HIV infections, either with or without HAART, were not associated with increased diagnoses of neurodegenerative dementias in patients older than 50 in Taiwan.",Wu-Chien Chien;Chi-Hsiang Chung;Yia-Ping Liu;Chin-Bin Yeh;Kuang-Huei Chen;Szu-Nian Yang;Hsin-An Chang;Yu-Chen Kao;Wan-Chun Lu;Nian-Sheng Tzeng
259,Abbas Ebadi,"Background and aim
Memory impairment in the elderly has a high prevalence and can affect their performance, interactions and quality of life. A valid and reliable questionnaire is required to investigate the changes in the memory of the elderly. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Memory Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) in the elderly.


Methods
In this methodological study, 361 elderly people (181 people for exploratory factor analysis and 180 people for confirmatory factor analysis) were selected via convenience sampling. This questionnaire was translated based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines. Construct validities were assessed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Its reliability was also assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient.


Results
In the exploratory factor analysis, three factors of lifestyle restrictions, positive coping, and negative emotion were extracted that were able to explain 54.04% of the total variance of the impact of memory change in the elderly. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the goodness of fit of the three-factor model of MIQ (RMSEA: 0.083; GFI: 0.97; NFI: 0.94; IFI: 0.97; PNFI: 0.86; AGFI: 0.75). The reliability of the ""lifestyle restrictions"", ""negative emotion"" and ""positive coping"" factors was found to be 0.89, 0.74, and 0.67, respectively, using Cronbach's alpha coefficient.


Conclusion
The Persian version of the MIQ is simple and practical and has acceptable reliability and validity that can be used to measure memory changes in the Iranian elderly.",Fariba Ebtekar;Naser Parizad;Abdorrahim Afkhamzadeh;Sahar Dalvand;Reza Ghanei Gheshlagh
260,Ye Wang,"Mammalian brains respond to new concepts via a type of neural coding termed ""concept coding."" During concept coding, the dentate gyrus (DG) plays a vital role in pattern separation and pattern integration of concepts because it is a brain region with substantial neurogenesis in adult mammals. Although concept coding properties of the brain have been extensively studied by experimental work, modeling of the process to guide both further experimental studies and applications such as natural language processing is scarce. To model brain-like concept coding, we built a spiking neural network inspired by adulthood neurogenesis in the DG. Our model suggests that neurogenesis may facilitate integration of closely related concepts and separation of less relevant concepts. Such pattern agrees with the previous experimental observations in classification tasks and place cells in the hippocampus. Therefore, our simulation provides insight for future experimental studies on the neural coding difference between perception and cognition. By presenting 14 contexts each containing 4 concepts to the network, we found that neural responses of the DG changed dynamically as the context repetition time increased and were eventually consistent with the category organization of humans. Thus, our work provides a new framework of word representation for the construction of brain-like knowledge map.",Yan Gao;Yaling Deng;Lei Yang
261,Wan-Li Xiang,"Artificial bee colony (ABC) has a good exploration ability against its exploitation ability. For enhancing its comprehensive performance, we proposed a multistrategy artificial bee colony (ABCVNS for short) based on the variable neighborhood search method. First, a search strategy candidate pool composed of two search strategies, i.e., ABC/best/1 and ABC/rand/1, is proposed and employed in the employed bee phase and onlooker bee phase. Second, we present another search strategy candidate pool which consists of the original random search strategy and the opposition-based learning method. Then, it is used to further balance the exploration and exploitation abilities in the scout bee phase. Last but not least, motivated by the scheme of neighborhood change of variable neighborhood search, a simple yet efficient choice mechanism of search strategies is presented. Subsequently, the effectiveness of ABCVNS is carried out on two test suites composed of fifty-eight problems. Furthermore, comparisons among ABCVNS and several famous methods are also carried out.

262,Jiangfan Feng,"The performance of convolutional neural network- (CNN-) based object detection has achieved incredible success. Howbeit, existing CNN-based algorithms suffer from a problem that small-scale objects are difficult to detect because it may have lost its response when the feature map has reached a certain depth, and it is common that the scale of objects (such as cars, buses, and pedestrians) contained in traffic images and videos varies greatly. In this paper, we present a 32-layer multibranch convolutional neural network named MBNet for fast detecting objects in traffic scenes. Our model utilizes three detection branches, in which feature maps with a size of 16 × 16, 32 × 32, and 64 × 64 are used, respectively, to optimize the detection for large-, medium-, and small-scale objects. By means of a multitask loss function, our model can be trained end-to-end. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of precision and recall rate, and the detection speed (up to 33 fps) is fast, which can meet the real-time requirements of industry.",Fanjie Wang;Siqin Feng;Yongrong Peng
263,Wubalem Fekadu,"Introduction
Most people with epilepsy suffer from a dual burden. In one hand, they struggle with the symptoms and disabilities on the other hand from misconceptions and stigma associated with it. But there are no recent studies which assess the community's perception and attitude.


Objective
To assess the perception and attitude of the community towards people with epilepsy and identify associated factors.


Methods
A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in South Ethiopia from a total of 701 participants. Data were collected with face to face interview using a structured questionnaire developed based on the Health Belief Model (HBM). Data were presented with frequencies, tables, and figures. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was done to identify significantly important variables. The presence of association was presented by odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Ethical clearance was obtained from Wolaita Sodo University.


Results
The most frequently mentioned perceived causes for epilepsy were stress (91%), substance use (61.8%), and bad spirit (49.8%) while loss of consciousness and falling (80.7%) and sleep problems (78%) were considered symptoms of epilepsy. Only 13.1% of the participants think that they may be susceptible for epilepsy. Six hundred sixty (94.2%) participants will not employ a person with epilepsy while only 47 (6.7%) of the participants will allow a family member to marry a person with epilepsy. In multivariable analysis, understanding the illness as a medical problem was associated with perceived susceptibility and perceived benefit of modern treatment was significantly associated with having a current medical problem.


Conclusions
The knowledge about the cause, possible susceptibility, better treatment options, and attitude of the participants were similar to other low-income settings. The negative attitude was high and multidimensional. All stakeholders must work to increase awareness about the cause, symptoms, and treatment options for epilepsy and to decrease the negative attitude of the community.",Tesfa Mekonen;Shemelash Bitew;Tefera Chanie Mekonnen;Melak Menberu;Seble Shewangizaw
264,Jiyeon Lee,"Syntactic alignment in dialogue is pervasive and enduring in unimpaired speakers, facilitating language processing and learning. Recent work suggests that syntactic alignment extends to the level of event-semantic properties (syntactic entrainment). Two experiments examined whether syntactic entrainment can ameliorate impaired message-structure mapping in persons with aphasia (PWA). In Experiment 1, participants first heard twelve picture descriptions, each using one of two suitable syntactic structures, prior to describing the same twelve pictures themselves. In Experiment 2, participants also repeated the heard picture descriptions, thereby increasing the depth of encoding for prime sentences. PWA showed a robust tendency to re-use previously encountered syntactic structures in their own production only in Experiment 2. They produced fewer 'mapping' errors (e.g., thematic role reversals) in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1. Syntactic entrainment remains resilient in aphasia, strengthening their event-semantic-to-syntax mappings, at least when active encoding of prior message-syntax associations is ensured.",Grace Man;Victor Ferreira;Nicholas Gruberg
265,G R I Barker,"Remembering the sequence, in which stimuli are encountered or events have occurred, is a key process in episodic memory and can also facilitate recognition memory. Rodents, when presented with a sequence of objects, will explore the object encountered first; yet, whether this behaviour is because the rodents spontaneously encode the order of stimuli presentation or because of relative familiarity or temporal decay is unknown. Here, we tested sequence memory in rats using a series of spontaneous preference tasks. Experiment 1 demonstrated that when rats are presented with a sequence of four objects, with an inter-sample interval of 5 min or 1 h, they preferentially explored the object presented earlier in the list irrespective of the inter-sample interval. We then demonstrated that such memory for order was not affected by increasing or decreasing the inter-sample interval between the middle objects (Experiment 2). Finally, we showed that memory for order is not a function of absolute object familiarity, as animals showed clear discrimination between the objects presented in the sample phases and a novel object, independent of the sample objects' position in the sequence (Experiment 3). These results show that animals are able to encode the order of objects presented in a sequence, and as such temporal order memory is not achieved using the process of relative or absolute familiarity or temporal decay.",O Evuarherhe;E C Warburton
266,Ting Lei,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors of class C GPCRs exist as constitutive dimers, which play important roles in activating excitatory synapses of the central nerve system. However, the activation mechanism induced by agonists has not been clarified on experiments. To address the problem, we used microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation couple with protein structure network (PSN) to explore the glutamate-induced activation for the mGluR1 homodimer. The results indicate that the glutamate binding stabilizes not only the closure of venus flytrap domains but also the polar interaction of LB2-LB2, in turn keeping the extracelluar domain in the active state. The activation of the excelluar domain drives transmembrane domains (TMDs) of the two protomers closer and induces aymmetric activation for the TMD domains of the two protomers. One protomer with lower binding affinity to the agonist is activated while the other protomer with higher binding energy is still in the inactive state. The PSN analysis identifies the allostrical regulation-pathway from the ligand-binding pocket in the extracellur domain to the G-protein binding site in the intracellur TMD region, and further reveals that the asymmetric activation is attributed to be a combination of trans-pathway and cis-pathway regulations from the two glumatates, rather than a single activation pathway. These observations could provide valuable molecular information for understanding of the structure and the implication in drug efficacy for the class C GPCR dimers.",Zhenxin Hu;Ruolin Ding;Jianfang Chen;Shiqi Li;Fuhui Zhang;XueMei Pu;Nanrong Zhao

268,Churl-Su Kwon,"Introduction: As deep brain stimulation revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders in the late 80s, neuromodulation in the treatment of epilepsy will undoubtedly undergo transformative changes in the years to come with the exponential growth of technological development moving into mainstream practice; the appearance of companies such as Facebook, Google, Neuralink within the realm of brain-computer interfaces points to this trend.Areas covered: This perspective piece will talk about the history of brain stimulation in epilepsy, current-approved treatments, technical developments and the future of neurostimulation.Expert opinion: Further understanding of the brain alongside machine learning and innovative technology will be the future of neuromodulation for the treatment of epilepsy. All of these innovations and advances should pave the way toward overcoming the vexing underutilization of surgery in the therapeutic armamentarium against medically refractory seizures, given the implicit advantage of a neuromodulatory rather than neurodestructive approach.",Nathalie Jetté;Saadi Ghatan
269,Shao-Hua Su,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies reported that URB597 (URB) had therapeutic potential for treating chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced neuroinflammation and autophagy dysfunction. However, the interaction mechanisms underlying the CCH-induced abnormal excessive autophagy and neuroinflammation remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the roles of impaired autophagy in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing (NLRP) 3 inflammasome activation in the rat hippocampus and the underlying mechanisms under the condition of induced CCH as well as the effect of URB treatment.


METHODS
The CCH rat model was established by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo), and rats were randomly divided into 11 groups as follows: (1) sham-operated, (2) BCCAo; (3) BCCAo+autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), (4) BCCAo+lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ), (5) BCCAo+microglial activation inhibitor minocycline, (6) BCCAo+ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC), (7) BCCAo+URB, (8) BCCAo+URB+3-MA, (9) BCCAo+URB+CQ, (10) BCCAo+URB+minocycline, (11) BCCAo+URB+NAC. The cell localizations of LC3, p62, LAMP1, TOM20 and NLRP3 were assessed by immunofluorescence staining. The levels of autophagy-related proteins (LC3, p62, LAMP1, BNIP3 and parkin), NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins (NLRP3, CASP1 and IL-1β), microglial marker (OX-42) and proinflammatory cytokines (iNOS and COX-2) were evaluated by western blotting, and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-a) were determined by ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed by dihydroethidium staining. The mitochondrial ultrastructural changes were examined by electron microscopy.


RESULTS
CCH induced microglial overactivation and ROS accumulation, promoting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of IL-1β. Blocked autophagy and mitophagy flux enhanced the activation of the NLRP3-CASP1 inflammasome pathway. However, URB alleviated impaired autophagy and mitophagy by decreasing mitochondrial ROS and microglial overactivation as well as restoring lysosomal function, which would further inhibit the activation of the NLRP3-CASP1 inflammasome pathway.


CONCLUSION
These findings extended previous studies indicating the function of URB in the mitigation of chronic ischemic injury of the brain.",Yi-Fang Wu;Qi Lin;Da-Peng Wang;Jian Hai
270,Maria Martinez-Lage,"Recent work has highlighted the tumor microenvironment as a central player in cancer. In particular, interactions between tumor and immune cells may help drive the development of brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Despite significant research into the molecular classification of glioblastoma, few studies have characterized in a comprehensive manner the immune infiltrate in situ and within different GBM subtypes.In this study, we use an unbiased, automated immunohistochemistry-based approach to determine the immune phenotype of the four GBM subtypes (classical, mesenchymal, neural and proneural) in a cohort of 98 patients. Tissue Micro Arrays (TMA) were stained for CD20 (B lymphocytes), CD5, CD3, CD4, CD8 (T lymphocytes), CD68 (microglia), and CD163 (bone marrow derived macrophages) antibodies. Using automated image analysis, the percentage of each immune population was calculated with respect to the total tumor cells. Mesenchymal GBMs displayed the highest percentage of microglia, macrophage, and lymphocyte infiltration. CD68+ and CD163+ cells were the most abundant cell populations in all four GBM subtypes, and a higher percentage of CD163+ cells was associated with a worse prognosis. We also compared our results to the relative composition of immune cell type infiltration (using RNA-seq data) across TCGA GBM tumors and validated our results obtained with immunohistochemistry with an external cohort and a different method. The results of this study offer a comprehensive analysis of the distribution and the infiltration of the immune components across the four commonly described GBM subgroups, setting the basis for a more detailed patient classification and new insights that may be used to better apply or design immunotherapies for GBM.",Timothy M Lynch;Yingtao Bi;Carolina Cocito;Gregory P Way;Sharmistha Pal;Josephine Haller;Rachel E Yan;Amy Ziober;Aivi Nguyen;Manoj Kandpal;Donald M O'Rourke;Jeffrey P Greenfield;Casey S Greene;Ramana V Davuluri;Nadia Dahmane
271,Enrico Faldini,"Many mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit impairments in hippocampal long-term-potentiation (LTP), seemingly corroborating the strong correlation between synaptic loss and cognitive decline reported in human studies. In other AD mouse models LTP is unaffected, but other defects in synaptic plasticity may still be present. We recently reported that THY-Tau22 transgenic mice, that overexpress human Tau protein carrying P301S and G272 V mutations and show normal LTP upon high-frequency-stimulation (HFS), develop severe changes in NMDAR mediated long-term-depression (LTD), the physiological counterpart of LTP. In the present study, we focused on putative effects of AD-related pathologies on depotentiation (DP), another form of synaptic plasticity. Using a novel protocol to induce DP in the CA1-region, we found in 11-15 months old male THY-Tau22 and APPPS1-21 transgenic mice that DP was not deteriorated by Aß pathology while significantly compromised by Tau pathology. Our findings advocate DP as a complementary form of synaptic plasticity that may help in elucidating synaptic pathomechanisms associated with different types of dementia.",Tariq Ahmed;Luc Bueé;David Blum;Detlef Balschun
272,Xiong Zhang,"BACKGROUND
Glaucoma, the number one cause of irreversible blindness, is characterized by the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which do not regenerate in humans or mammals after cell death. Cell transplantation provides an opportunity to restore vision in glaucoma, or other optic neuropathies. Since transplanting primary RGCs from deceased donor tissues may not be feasible, stem cell-derived RGCs could provide a plausible alternative source of donor cells for transplant.


OBJECTIVE
We define a robust chemically defined protocol to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into RGC-like neurons.


METHODS
Human embryonic stem cell lines (H7-A81 and H9) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) were used for RGC differentiation. RGC immaturity was measured by calcium imaging against muscimol. Cell markers were detected by immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR. RGC-like cells were intravitreally injected to rat eye, and co-stained with RBPMS and human nuclei markers. All experiments were conducted at least three times independently. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey's test with P value of <0.05 considered statistically significant.


RESULTS
We detected retinal progenitor markers Rx and Pax6 after 15 days of differentiation, and the expression of markers for RGC-specific differentiation (Brn3a and Brn3b), maturation (synaptophysin) and neurite growth (β-III-tubulin) after an additional 15 days. We further examined the physiologic differentiation of these hESC-derived RGC-like progeny to those differentiated in vitro from primary rodent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) with calcium imaging, and found that both populations demonstrate the immature RGC-like response to muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist. By one week after transplant to the adult rat eye by intravitreal injection, the human RGC-like cells successfully migrated into the ganglion cell layer.


CONCLUSIONS
Our protocol provides a novel, short, and cost-effective approach for RGC differentiation from hESCs, and may broaden the scope for cell replacement therapy in RGC-related optic neuropathies such as glaucoma.",Kevin Tenerelli;Suqian Wu;Xin Xia;Satoshi Yokota;Catalina Sun;Joana Galvao;Praseeda Venugopalan;Chenyi Li;Ankush Madaan;Jeffrey L Goldberg;Kun-Che Chang
273,Eman M Khedr,"BACKGROUND
The exact mechanism of cognitive impairment in PD is not known. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed as a possible treatment for cognitive impairment and to treat the motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) where its effects seem additive to those of dopaminergic medications.


OBJECTIVE
In this pilot study we investigated whether repeated sessions of rTMS have an effect on measures of cognitive impairment in patients with PD dementia.


METHODS
33 patients with PD dementia were randomly assigned sham or real rTMS (2000 pulses; 20 Hz; 90% RMT; 10 trains of 10 s with 25 s between each train) over the hand area of each motor cortex (5 min between hemispheres) for 10 days (5 days/week) followed by 5 booster sessions every month for 3 months. Assessments included the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR); Memory and Executive Screening (MES) and Instrumental activity of Daily Living (IADL). Event related potentials (P300) and cortical excitability were measured before treatment and after the last session.


RESULTS
There were no significant differences in the effects of rTMS between groups. Although rTMS improved motor function in the active group it had only a minor effect on two of the dementia rating scores (the MMSE and MoCA) but not the others (CDR and MES). There was also a reduction in the latency of the P300 in the active group.


CONCLUSIONS
rTMS over M1 is useful for motor function and may have a small positive effect on cognition. However, better approaches for the latter are necessary, may be require multisite rTMS to target both motor and frontal cortical region.",Khaled O Mohamed;Anwar M Ali;Asmaa M Hasan

We aimed to characterize parkinsonian features and gait performance of psychiatric patients on neuroleptics (PPN) and to compare them to Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls (HC).


METHODS
Hospitalized PPN (n = 27) were recruited, examined, and rated for parkinsonian signs according to the motor part of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and performed a 10-m ""timed-up-and-go"" (TUG) test with a smartphone-based motion capture system attached to their sternum. Gait parameters and mUPDRS scores were compared to those of consecutive age-matched PD patients (n = 18) and HC (n = 27).


RESULTS
Psychiatric patients on neuroleptics exhibited parkinsonism (mUPDRS score range: 8-44) but less than that of PD patients (18.2 ± 9.2 vs 29.8 ± 10.3, P = 0.001). TUG times were slower for PPN and PD versus HC (total: 30.6 ± 7.6 seconds vs 30.0 ± 7.3 seconds vs 20.0 ± 3.2 seconds, straight walking: 10.6 ± 2.7 seconds vs 10.6 ± 2.4 seconds vs 6.8 ± 1.2 seconds) (P < 0.001), and cadence and step length were similar among PPN and PD and different from HC as well. Although their gait speed was slower than HC but similar to PD, PPN had lower mediolateral sway (4.3 ± 1.1 cm vs 6.7 ± 2.9 cm vs 6.9 ± 2.9 cm, respectively, P < 0.001) than both.


CONCLUSIONS
Parkinsonism is very common in hospitalized PPN, but usually milder than that of PD.

275,Nicola D Fearn,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA) is one of the most common causes of arterial ischaemic stroke in a previously healthy child. Distinguishing between different subtypes of arteriopathy is challenging and has significant management implications.


RECENT FINDINGS
Recent studies have helped to define the subtypes of focal cerebral arteriopathies and improved understanding of their clinical and radiological features. In addition, they have reported new evidence for the association between viral infection and inflammation in the pathogenesis of FCA and proposed new radiological, serum and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers to guide diagnosis and management. There is limited evidence to guide treatment of FCA but a role for steroids and antiviral therapies have been reported.


SUMMARY
Despite the recent advances there is a limited knowledge of the pathophysiology and outcomes following FCA. Research priorities include the identification of biomarkers to improve accuracy of initial diagnosis and predict progression, and interventional trials to determine best treatments to reduce stroke recurrence risk.",Mark T Mackay

Achieving complete reperfusion is a key determinant of good outcome in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT). However, data on treatments geared toward improving reperfusion after incomplete MT are sparse.


Objective
To determine whether administration of intra-arterial urokinase is safe and improves reperfusion after failed or incomplete MT.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This observational cohort study included a consecutive sample of patients treated with second-generation MT from January 1, 2010, through August 4, 2017. Data were collected from the prospective registry of a tertiary care stroke center. Of 1274 patients screened, 69 refused to participate, and 993 met the observational studies inclusion criteria of a large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through September 20, 2019.


Intervention
One hundred patients received intra-arterial urokinase after failed or incomplete MT using manual microcatheter injections.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Primary safety outcome was the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) according to the Prolyse in Acute Cerebral Thromboembolism II criteria. Secondary end points included 90-day mortality and 90-day functional independence (defined as modified Rankin Scale score of ≤2). Efficacy was evaluated angiographically, applying the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale.


Results
After exclusion of patients with posterior circulation strokes and those treated with intra-arterial thrombolytics only, 993 patients were included in the final analyses (median age, 74.6 [interquartile range, 62.6-82.2] years; 505 [50.9%] women). Additional intra-arterial urokinase was administered in 100 patients (10.1%). The most common reason for administering intra-arterial urokinase was incomplete reperfusion (TICI<3) after MT (53 [53.0%]). After adjusting for baseline characteristics underlying case selection, intra-arterial urokinase was not associated with an increased risk of sICH (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.31-2.13) or 90-day mortality (aOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.43-1.40). Among 53 cases of partial or near-complete reperfusion and treated with intra-arterial urokinase, 32 (60.4%) had early reperfusion improvement, and 18 of 53 (34.0%) had an improvement in TICI grade. Correspondingly, patients treated with intra-arterial urokinase had higher rates of functional independence after adjusting for the selection bias favoring a priori poor TICI grades in the intra-arterial urokinase group (aOR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.11-3.37).

Multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses may be increased in the postpartum period, and whether breastfeeding is associated with reduction in the risk of postpartum relapses remains controversial.


Objective
To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether breastfeeding is associated with reduction in postpartum MS relapses compared with not breastfeeding.


Data Sources
PubMed and Embase were searched for studies assessing the association between breastfeeding and MS disease activity published between January 1, 1980, and July 11, 2018, as well as reference lists of selected articles.


Study Selection
All study designs assessing the association between breastfeeding and postpartum relapses in MS relative to a comparator group were included.


Data Extraction and Synthesis
Study eligibility assessment and extraction of study characteristics, methods, and outcomes, were performed independently by 2 reviewers following PRISMA guidelines. Risk of bias was evaluated by 2 independent reviewers with the ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized, interventional studies. Findings from studies with data available for the number of women with postpartum relapses in the breastfeeding and nonbreastfeeding groups were combined with a random-effects model.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Postpartum MS relapse.


Results
The search identified 462 unique citations, and 24 (2974 women) satisfied eligibility criteria and were included, of which 16 were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. The pooled summary odds ratio for the association of breastfeeding with postpartum relapses was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.45-0.88; P = .006) compared with a reference of nonbreastfeeding. Pooled adjusted hazard ratio across 4 studies that reported this finding was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.38-0.85; P = .006). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 48%), which was explained by variable prepregnancy relapse rate, postpartum follow-up duration, and the publication year. A stronger association was seen in studies of exclusive rather than nonexclusive breastfeeding, although both demonstrated an association. Studies were rated at moderate and serious risk of bias, with concern for residual confounding, although sensitivity analysis including only moderate quality studies was consistent with a protective outcome of breastfeeding.


Conclusions and Relevance
These findings suggest that breastfeeding is protective against postpartum relapses in MS, although high-quality prospective studies to date are limited and well-designed observational studies that aim to emulate a randomized trial would be of benefit.",Alice Rutatangwa;Jennifer Graves;Ann Lazar;Emmanuelle Waubant
278,Tomoyuki Taguchi,"Parkinson's disease is one of the most common movement disorders and is characterized by dopaminergic cell loss and the accumulation of pathological α-synuclein, but its precise pathogenetic mechanisms remain elusive. To develop disease-modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease, an animal model that recapitulates the pathology and symptoms of the disease, especially in the prodromal stage, is indispensable. As subjects with α-synuclein gene (SNCA) multiplication as well as point mutations develop familial Parkinson's disease and a genome-wide association study in Parkinson's disease has identified SNCA as a risk gene for Parkinson's disease, the increased expression of α-synuclein is closely associated with the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. In this study we generated bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice harbouring SNCA and its gene expression regulatory regions in order to maintain the native expression pattern of α-synuclein. Furthermore, to enhance the pathological properties of α-synuclein, we inserted into SNCA an A53T mutation, two single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in a genome-wide association study in Parkinson's disease and a Rep1 polymorphism, all of which are causal of familial Parkinson's disease or increase the risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease. These A53T SNCA bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice showed an expression pattern of human α-synuclein very similar to that of endogenous mouse α-synuclein. They expressed truncated, oligomeric and proteinase K-resistant phosphorylated forms of α-synuclein in the regions that are specifically affected in Parkinson's disease and/or dementia with Lewy bodies, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, striatum and substantia nigra. Surprisingly, these mice exhibited rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia, which is a key feature of REM sleep behaviour disorder, at as early as 5 months of age. Consistent with this observation, the REM sleep-regulating neuronal populations in the lower brainstem, including the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus, nuclei in the ventromedial medullary reticular formation and the pedunculopontine nuclei, expressed phosphorylated α-synuclein. In addition, they also showed hyposmia at 9 months of age, which is consistent with the significant accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein in the olfactory bulb. The dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta degenerated, and their number was decreased in an age-dependent manner by up to 17.1% at 18 months of age compared to wild-type, although the mice did not show any related locomotor dysfunction. In conclusion, we created a novel mouse model of prodromal Parkinson's disease that showed RBD-like behaviour and hyposmia without motor symptoms.",Masashi Ikuno;Mari Hondo;Laxmi Kumar Parajuli;Katsutoshi Taguchi;Jun Ueda;Masanori Sawamura;Shinya Okuda;Etsuro Nakanishi;Junko Hara;Norihito Uemura;Yusuke Hatanaka;Takashi Ayaki;Shuichi Matsuzawa;Masaki Tanaka;Omar M A El-Agnaf;Masato Koike;Masashi Yanagisawa;Maiko T Uemura;Hodaka Yamakado;Ryosuke Takahashi

Adults with pelvic floor disorders commonly present with overlapping bladder and bowel symptoms; however, the relationship between urinary and defecatory dysfunction is not well understood. Our aim was to compare and determine if overlapping brain regions are activated during bladder filling and rectal distention in healthy adults.


METHODS
We conducted separate Pubmed searches for neuroimaging studies investigating the effects of rectal distention and bladder filling on brain activation in healthy subjects. Coordinates of activated regions were extracted with cluster-level threshold P < .05 and compared using the activation likelihood estimate approach. Results from the various studies were pooled and a contrast analysis was performed to identify any common areas of activation between bladder filling and rectal distension.


RESULTS
We identified 96 foci of activation from 14 neuroimaging studies on bladder filling and 182 foci from 17 studies on rectal distension in healthy adults. Regions activated during bladder filling included right insula, right and left thalamus, and right periaqueductal grey. Regions activated during rectal distention included right and left insula, right and left thalamus, left postcentral gyrus, and right inferior parietal lobule. Contrast analysis revealed common activation of the right insula with both rectal distention and bladder filling.


CONCLUSION
Bladder filling and rectal distention activate several separate areas of the brain involved in sensory processing in healthy adults. The common activation of the insula, the region responsible for interoception, in these two conditions may offer an explanation for the coexistence of bladder and defecatory symptoms in pelvic floor disorders.",Uduak U Andy;Hengyi Rao;Lily A Arya
280,Milos Veleminsky,"The development of attachment during the perinatal and/or postnatal periods between a child their mother, father and family as whole can be observed. This attachment provides the child with the safety and security feelings and may provide satisfaction to the mother and other family members. In children with physical and mental developmental disability, attachment may be challenged immediately after birth. It is typically recovered after a certain period. The authors describe the development of attachment of family members to children with somatic, mental or social disability based on an analysis of nine case reports. They conclude that the attachment of parents/mothers to their child with a disability is typically established after a certain period of time only. In the first period, there is a caregiving attitude of the mother even though the period of the origination of this tie takes place later. The mother is most frequently the person establishing attachment. However, this is not always the rule. In our cases, there were two fathers, who made the attachment earlier than respective mothers. Attachment was also evident in some grandparents and siblings. The parents, mostly the fathers, can lose the attachment established. Analysis of the degree of attachment to the child by parents may be complicated due to difficulty in assessing the extent and degree of the attachment of children with severe disabilities to their parents.",Milos Veleminsky;Peter Fedor-Freybergh;Aneta Witzanyová;Ingrid Šťastná
281,Bingjie Zhao,"We reported a case of carotid artery stenosis with stroke symptoms detected in a patient with lung cancer after radiotherapy. The patient was a 58-year-old male with a complaint of \""a single episode of temporary amaurosis in the right eye for 10 minutes"". The clinical diagnosis at admission, after consideration of the patient's age, medical history, and auxiliary examination results, was as follows: lung cancer; right common carotid artery stenosis; left common carotid artery stenosis; left vertebral artery stenosis; and right subclavian artery occlusion with right subclavian steal syndrome (Grade 3). Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) were subsequently performed. During the 6-month follow-up, we observed no episode of temporary vision loss or other signs of stroke. Clinicians should pay great attention to delayed radiation-induced carotid stenosis. It is recommended that patients with a history of radiotherapy should undergo regular color Doppler ultrasound examination of the cervical region to diagnose, prevent, and treat RICS in an expedient fashion.

282,Milos Slepecky,"OBJECTIVE
Young schema questionnaire - short form (YSQ-S3) represents a useful method for the identification of early maladaptive schemas in clinical and non-clinical samples. The study aimed to examine the internal consistency and factorial structure of the recently adapted Slovak version of YSQ-S3 in a non-clinical sample.


METHODS
The sample consisted of 302 healthy participants from the general population in Slovakia. Slovak version of YSQ-S3 was used. Reliability analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed.


RESULTS
The results suggest an acceptable internal consistency of early maladaptive schemas (EMSs). The Cronbach's alpha coefficients of YSQ-S3 subscales ranged from 0.54 to 0.85. Confirmatory factor analysis supports the factor structures of 18 unifactorial EMSs. The results partially support Young's theoretical schema clusters and fail to support the second-order factor model.


CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the Slovak version of the YSQ-S3 is a psychometrically sound questionnaire that can be utilized for assessing EMS, both for research and clinical purposes.",Antonia Kotianova;Tomáš Sollár;Marie Ociskova;Jana Turzakova;Marta Zatkova;Marta Popelkova;Jan Prasko;Andrea Solgajová;Martina Romanova;Peter Trizna

284,Monika Sivakova,"OBJECTIVES
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) typically affecting young adults. Although the pathogenesis of MS is not fully understood, there is evidence to suggest that inflammation-induced oxidative stress can play a role in demyelination and axonal damage. Oxidative stress also participates in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. Data from large epidemiological studies showed a higher risk of vascular events in MS patients. The aim of our study was to analyse the presence of oxidative stress and its association with the parameters of subclinical atherosclerosis in the early stages of MS.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
We compared 13 newly diagnosed MS patients with a group of 13 healthy age- and BMI-matched controls. Blood samples were measured for total antioxidant activity using TEAC assay. Endothelial function, expressed as reperfusion hyperaemia index (RHI) and arterial stiffness, expressed as augmentation index standardized to a pulse of 75/min (AI@75) were assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry.


RESULTS
MS patients had significantly lower TEAC compared to controls [0.8 (0.4-2.4) vs. 1.2 (0.6-3.8) mmol/l; p=0.004]. The frequency of increased arterial stiffness (61.6% vs. 30.8%) and endothelial dysfunction (46.2% vs. 38.5%) was comparable in MS patients and in controls. There was no significant association between TEAC, increased arterial stiffness or endothelial dysfunction in patients and controls.


CONCLUSION
Our study showed decreased antioxidant capacity in newly diagnosed MS patients compared to controls. We failed to find association of subclinical atherosclerosis with oxidative stress in newly diagnosed MS.",Pavel Siarnik;Pavol Filippi;Miroslav Vlcek;Richard Imrich;Peter Turcani;Ingrid Zitnanova;Adela Penesova;Zofia Radikova;Branislav Kollar

The study aimed to detect factors predicting a successful pharmacological induction of first-trimester miscarriage.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
A prospective, cohort research was conducted at the 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Warsaw, between years 2011-2015. 642 women diagnosed with first trimester miscarriage qualified for pharmacological induction with misoprostol were included in the study. Each patient underwent repeatable doses of 800mcg misoprostol vaginally. The endpoint was complete excretion of all tissues, with no need to perform surgical curettage. Type of miscarriage, gravidity, parity, number of doses, time of drug administration and side effects were analysed as possible factors influencing the results. The statistical analysis was performed with STATISTICA 10.0 software.


RESULTS
The percentage of successful miscarriage induction was 83.6%. Two main factors corresponded with successful pharmacological treatment in regression analysis: number of administered doses (adjusted OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.18-2.29) and week of gestation (aOR 1.22; 95%CI 1.03-1.44). The success of the pharmacological induction of miscarriage was significantly decreased if the woman had a history of caesarean section (aOR 0.34; 95% CI 0.2-0.57). 2.2% of patients experienced benign side effects of the therapy.


CONCLUSIONS
Pharmacological induction is an effective and safe treatment method of first trimester abortion in the majority of cases. The knowledge of factors influencing the efficacy of misoprostol may help clinicians in proper counselling and individualisation of therapy.",Iwona Szymusik;Magdalena Zgliczynska;Katarzyna Szarla;Natalia Kopylowska;Szymon Piatek;Katarzyna Kosinska-Kaczynska;Miroslaw Wielgos
286,Kristina Melkersson,"OBJECTIVES
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), resulting from an immune-associated destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells, has been reported in a few earlier studies to be inversely associated with schizophrenia, but not with schizophrenia-like psychoses. The aim of this study was to verify this finding by carrying out a Swedish register study.


METHODS
Data from the Total Population- and Medical Birth-Registers were used to create a cohort of all individuals born in Sweden 1987-2004. The cohort individuals were linked with the Inpatient- and Outpatient-Registers and followed from birth to 2017 to identify onset of T1DM, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess the association between T1DM and risk of developing schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder during a follow-up from age 13.


RESULTS
The study population included 1 745 977 individuals and the length of follow-up was maximally 18.0 (median 9.7) years. During the follow-up, 1 280 individuals developed schizophrenia and 649 individuals schizoaffective disorder. The risk of developing schizophrenia was significantly lower among individuals with, than among individuals without, a diagnosis of T1DM, whereas the risk of developing schizoaffective disorder did not differ among individuals with or without a T1DM diagnosis [adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval); schizophrenia: 0.29 (0.09-0.91), p=0.0338, schizoaffective disorder: 1.50 (0.71-3.16), p=0.2909].


CONCLUSIONS
This study, in line with previous studies, shows that a diagnosis of T1DM is associated with a decreased risk of schizophrenia. This finding of an inverse association between T1DM and schizophrenia may bring an interesting piece, related to autoimmunity, into the schizophrenia-aetiology puzzle.",Mona-Lisa Wernroth
287,Abhishek Singh,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease mainly associated with cognition impairment. Studies in last more than six decades have suggested that the disease pathology primarily includes the depleted cholinergic neurons, accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and hyper phosphorylation of tau proteins. However, the disease etiology remains enigmatic and no therapy is available to modify the disease status. Studies in experimental models and in post mortem brain of AD patients have suggested the involvement of oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, unfolded protein responses and apoptosis in disease pathology, yet the information is deficit to develop the disease modifying therapeutics. Owing to the need of novel effective treatment, chronic consumption of medicines with minimum side effects, recently the researchers turned towards the traditional medicines. This review is mainly focusing on the traditional herbs which have been suggested to contain disease related antidote activities and may be utilized for the effective treatment of AD patients.",Sindhu Agarwal;Sarika Singh
288,Abha Gupta,"Molecular chaperones have a role to stabilize proteins or assist them in reaching their native fold. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of molecular chaperons that protect proteins from cellular stress during the assembly of protein complexes and also prevent the proteins from aggregation and disassembly. The immediate increase of HSPs is crucial for cellular adaptation to environmental changes and protection of other proteins from denaturation, thereby maintaining the cellular homeostasis and increasing the longevity of an organism. HSP70 and HSP90 are the most studied HSPs in this very large HSP family. Notably, HSP90 also stabilizes the disease-related proteins in neurodegenerative disorders.

289,Che Chuan Wang,"Excitotoxicity induced by excessive glutamate has been implicated in many brain disorders. Xanthohumol is a natural product derived from hops (Humulus lupulus L.), which is reported to have glutamate release-inhibiting activity. However, it is unknown whether xanthohumol has protective effects against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. This study investigated the potential action of xanthohumol in a rat model of excitotoxicity induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA). Xanthohumol (10 or 50 mg/kg) administrated intraperitoneally 30 min prior to KA (15 mg/kg) considerably ameliorated KA-induced seizures, glutamate concentration elevation, and CA3 neuron death. The decrease of mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn-2 and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression in hippocampal tissues following KA injection were reversed by xanthohumol. Moreover, apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) expression and caspase-3 activation in the hippocampus were inhibited by xanthohumol. These results suggest that xanthohumol up-regulates Mfn-2 and Bcl-2 to preserve mitochondrial function and suppress Apaf-1 and caspase-3 activation, thereby increasing neuron survival in rats after KA treatment. Therefore, xanthohumol has great potential for development into a therapeutic agent for improving glutamate-related nervous system diseases.",Yu Hsuan Ho;Chi Feng Hung;Jinn Rung Kuo;Su Jane Wang
290,Syed Suhail Andrabi,"Stroke is characterized by an initial ischemia followed by a reperfusion that promotes cascade of damage referred to as primary injury. The loss of mitochondrial function after ischemia, which is characterized by oxidative stress and activation of apoptotic factors is considered to play a crucial role in the proliferation of secondary injury and subsequent brain neuronal cell death. Dopamine D2 receptor agonist, Ropinirole, has been found to promote neuroprotection in Parkinson´s disease and restless leg syndrome. The current study was designed to test its efficacy in preclinical model of stroke. Previously it has been demonstrated that Ropinirole mediates its neuroprotection via mitochondrial pathways. Assuming this, we investigated the effect of Ropinirole on mitochondrial dysfunction, we have shown the positive effect of Ropinirole administration on behavioral deficits and mitochondrial health in an ischemic stroke injury model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Male Wistar rats underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and then received the Ropinirole (10 mg and 20 mg/kg b.w.) at 6 h, 12 and 18 h post occlusion. Behavioral assessment for functional deficits included grip strength, motor coordination and gait analysis. Our findings revealed a significant improvement with Ropinirole treatment in tMCAO animals. Staining of isolated brain slices from Ropinirole-treated rats with 2, 3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) showed a reduction in the infarct area in comparison to the vehicle group, indicating the presence of an increased number of viable mitochondria. Ropinirole treatment was also able to attenuate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as block the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), in the tMCAO injury model. In addition, it was also able to ameliorate the altered mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration ratio in the ischemic animals, thereby suggesting that Ropinirole has a positive effect on mitochondrial bioenergetics. Ropinirole inhibited the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol reduces the downstream apoptotic processes. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that Ropinirole treatment is beneficial in preserving the mitochondrial functions that are altered in cerebral ischemic injury and thus can help in defining better therapies.",Heena Tabassum;Sabiha Parveen;Suhel Parvez
291,M M J van den Berg,"Circulating microRNAs (cimiRNAs) are a class of non-encoding RNAs found in bodily fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tears. CimiRNAs have been implicated as promising biomarkers for central nervous system (CNS) disorders because they are actively secreted as messengers and are profoundly involved in fine-tuning of developmental and differentiation processes. Furthermore, they are attractive biomarkers because they are extremely stable, tissue enriched and can be determined in a quantitative manner. This review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment on the current progress regarding the potential value of cimiRNAs as CNS biomarkers. Within this framework five CNS disorders are explored which share a common pathological hallmark namely cognitive impairment. The CNS disorders include Major depression disorder (MDD), Bipolar disorder (BD), Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The similarities and differences between altered cimiRNAs in the different disorders are described. The miR-29 family, miR-34a-5p and miR-132-3p are discussed as common dysregulated cimiRNAs found in the CNS disorders.

292,Jasmine T Ho,"As a continual source of sensory input and fundamental component of self-referential processing, the body holds an integral modulatory role in cognition. In a healthy state, predictive coding of multisensory integration promotes the construction of a coherent self. However, several psychiatric disorders comprise aberrant perceptions of the bodily self that are purported to involve discrepancies in the integration and updating of multisensory systems. Changes in functional connectivity of somatomotor and high-level association networks in these disorders could be successfully remediated through 5-HT2A receptor agonism via psychedelics. Reported alterations of bodily self-awareness during psychedelic experiences allude to a potentially central role of the bodily self. In this article, we bridge the domains of (aberrant) bodily self-awareness and psychedelics by discussing the predictive coding mechanisms underlying the bodily self and psychedelics. Furthermore, we propose that psychedelically-induced desynchronization of predictive coding might involve modulation of somatomotor, sensorimotor, and high-level association networks that could remediate aberrant perceptions of the bodily self.",Katrin H Preller;Bigna Lenggenhager
293,Oula Puonti,"Comparing electric field simulations from individualized head models against in-vivo intra-cranial recordings is considered the gold standard for direct validation of computational field modeling for transcranial brain stimulation and brain mapping techniques such as electro- and magnetoencephalography. The measurements also help to improve simulation accuracy by pinning down the factors having the largest influence on the simulations. Here we compare field simulations from four different automated pipelines against intracranial voltage recordings in an existing dataset of 14 epilepsy patients. We show that modeling differences in the pipelines lead to notable differences in the simulated electric field distributions that are often large enough to change the conclusions regarding the dose distribution and strength in the brain. Specifically, differences in the automatic segmentations of the head anatomy from structural magnetic resonance images are a major factor contributing to the observed field differences. However, the differences in the simulated fields are not reflected in the comparison between the simulations and intra-cranial measurements. This apparent mismatch is partly explained by the noisiness of the intra-cranial measurements, which renders comparisons between the methods inconclusive. We further demonstrate that a standard regression analysis, which ignores uncertainties in the simulations, leads to a strong bias in the estimated linear relationship between simulated and measured fields. Ignoring this bias leads to the incorrect conclusion that the models systematically misestimate the field strength in the brain. We propose a new Bayesian regression analysis of the data that yields unbiased parameter estimates, along with their uncertainties, and gives further insights to the fit between simulations and measurements. Specifically, the unbiased results give only weak support for systematic misestimations of the fields by the models.",Guilherme B Saturnino;Kristoffer H Madsen;Axel Thielscher
294,Davide Tabarelli,"Successfully interpreting and navigating our natural visual environment requires us to track its dynamics constantly. Additionally, we focus our attention on behaviorally relevant stimuli to enhance their neural processing. Little is known, however, about how sustained attention affects the ongoing tracking of stimuli with rich natural temporal dynamics. Here, we used MRI-informed source reconstructions of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to map to what extent various cortical areas track concurrent continuous quasi-rhythmic visual stimulation. Further, we tested how top-down visuo-spatial attention influences this tracking process. Our bilaterally presented quasi-rhythmic stimuli covered a dynamic range of 4-20 Hz, subdivided into three distinct bands. As an experimental control, we also included strictly rhythmic stimulation (10 vs 12 Hz). Using a spectral measure of brain-stimulus coupling, we were able to track the neural processing of left vs. right stimuli independently, even while fluctuating within the same frequency range. The fidelity of neural tracking depended on the stimulation frequencies, decreasing for higher frequency bands. Both attended and non-attended stimuli were tracked beyond early visual cortices, in ventral and dorsal streams depending on the stimulus frequency. In general, tracking improved with the deployment of visuo-spatial attention to the stimulus location. Our results provide new insights into how human visual cortices process concurrent dynamic stimuli and provide a potential mechanism - namely increasing the temporal precision of tracking - for boosting the neural representation of attended input.",Christian Keitel;Joachim Gross;Daniel Baldauf
295,Hannes Almgren,"The influence of global BOLD fluctuations on resting state functional connectivity in fMRI data remains a topic of debate, with little consensus. In this study, we assessed the effects of global signal regression (GSR) on effective connectivity within and between resting state networks (RSNs) - as estimated with dynamic causal modelling (DCM) for resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). DCM incorporates a forward (generative) model that quantifies the contribution of different types of noise (including global measurement noise), effective connectivity, and (neuro)vascular processes to functional connectivity measurements. DCM analyses were applied to two different designs; namely, longitudinal and cross-sectional designs. In the modelling of longitudinal designs, we considered four extensive longitudinal resting state fMRI datasets with a total number of 20 subjects. In the analysis of cross-sectional designs, we used rsfMRI data from 361 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. We hypothesized that (1) GSR would have no discernible impact on effective connectivity estimated with DCM, and (2) GSR would be reflected in the parameters representing global measurement noise. Additionally, we performed comparative analyses of information gain with and without GSR. Our results showed negligible to small effects of GSR on effective connectivity within small (separately estimated) RSNs. However, although the effect sizes were small, there was substantial to conclusive evidence for an effect of GSR on connectivity parameters. For between-network connectivity, we found two important effects: the effect of GSR on between-network effective connectivity (averaged over all connections) was negligible to small, while the effect of GSR on individual connections was non-negligible. In the cross-sectional (but not in the longitudinal) data, some connections showed substantial to conclusive evidence for an effect of GSR. Contrary to our expectations, we found either no effect (in the longitudinal designs) or a non-specific (cross-sectional design) effect of GSR on parameters characterising (global) measurement noise. Data without GSR were found to be more informative than data with GSR; however, in small resting state networks the precision of posterior estimates was greater after GSR. In conclusion, GSR is a minor concern in DCM studies; however, quantitative interpretation of between-network connections (as opposed to average between-network connectivity) and noise parameters should be treated with some caution. The Kullback-Leibler divergence of the posterior from the prior (i.e., information gain) - together with the precision of posterior estimates - might offer a useful measure to assess the appropriateness of GSR in resting state fMRI.",Frederik Van de Steen;Adeel Razi;Karl Friston;Daniele Marinazzo
296,Jun Wu,"BACKGROUND
Surgical decompression and conservative treatment are routinely used in the treatment of patients with malignant infarction of middle cerebral artery (MIMCA). However, efficacy and safety were controversial. The purpose of the present study was to systematically compare the clinical outcomes between surgical decompression and conservative treatment in patients with MIMCA.


METHOD
This study retrieved available academic randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studies comparing the clinical outcomes between surgical decompression and conservative treatment in patients with MIMCA from the database of ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed. The references of previous reviews and related clinical studies were manually checked to retrieve potential literature that was not involved in our electronic search results.


RESULTS
A total of seven RCTs studies were included in the study. The overall participants of surgical decompression group were 165, whereas it was 173 in the conservative treatment group. The results revealed that surgical decompression group was related to a lower incidence of one-year death (OR= 0.192; 95% CI, 0.119 to 0.309; P<0.001), one-year death in patients over 60 years old (OR=0.202, 95%CI, 0.097 to 0.421, P<0.001), one-year death in patients less than 60 years old (OR=0.145, 95%CI, 0.069 to 0.301, P<0.001), one-year death in patients who are treated within 48 h of stroke onset (OR= 0.159, 95%CI 0.090 to 0.282, P<0.001), and modified Rankin Scale (mRS)≤3 (OR=2.082, 95% CI= 1.185 to 3.658, P<0.001).

Based on current evidence, for patients with MIMCA, decompressive surgery not only is a life-saving therapy but also reduces the incidence of mortality without increasing risk of severe disability.",Wei Wei;Yue-Hua Gao;Fang-Te Liang;Yun-Long Gao;Hai-Guang Yu;Qing-Liang Huang;Xin-Quan Long;Yu-Fan Zhou
297,Svetlana Kvint,"In this report, we describe an extremely rare case of a giant pseudoaneurysm of the internal iliac artery causing marked destructive changes at a disc space and mimicking discitis-osteomyelitis. Only two other cases of pseudoaneurysms extending into the disc space have been reported, and those arose from the aorta and were relatively straightforward to diagnose. Our case is unique because the pseudoaneurysm arose from the internal iliac artery, an artery that is not usually included in the field of view of lumbar MRIs or CT. However, the pseudoaneurysm was so large that it extended to the lumbosacral junction, where it eroded a disc space and caused findings of discitis-osteomyelitis. Complex paraspinal fluid collections causing osseous erosions should raise the possibility of an aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm. CT or conventional angiography should be considered if the question of a vascular mass/collection cannot be answered on conventional cross sectional imaging, as inadvertent biopsy of a pseudoaneurysm can cause catastrophic bleeding.",Neil R Malhotra;Mougnyan Cox;Jeffrey I Mondschein;Bryan A Pukenas;Linda J Bagley
298,Omid Nikoubashman,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies imply an association between aneurysm wall enhancement on contrast enhanced MRI and aneurysm rupture. We investigated the prevalence and clinical significance of aneurysm wall enhancement and enhancement within the aneurysm in coiled aneurysms.


METHODS
We assessed the frequency of aneurysm wall enhancement and enhancement within the aneurysm (inner enhancement) after coil embolization on postinterventional MRI (<6 weeks) in 30 consecutive patients with 33 aneurysms and elucidated the association between enhancement and subsequent aneurysm recurrence or hemorrhage.


RESULTS
aneurysm wall enhancement and inner enhancement occurred in 97% and 36% of cases, respectively. There was no re-hemorrhage and there was no significant association between subsequent reperfusion and aneurysm wall enhancement (p=.200) or inner enhancement (p=.148) during a median follow-up period of 19 months. The greatest share of inner enhancement (8/12) was found in incompletely coiled aneurysms with small remnants (p=.001).

aneurysm wall enhancement after coil embolization cannot serve for recurrence-risk-stratification, due to its high prevalence. Inner enhancement is likely to represent contrast inflow in the coiled aneurysm.",Carolin Molavi Tabrizi;Malte Münstermann;Gerrit Alexander Schubert;Arno Reich;Martin Wiesmann;Marguerite Müller
299,Lester Lee,"INTRODUCTION
Posterior fossa surgery is the established treatment for large cerebellar strokes with brainstem compression. Despite this, there is a paucity of data for long-term outcomes.


METHODS
A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent posterior fossa surgery for cerebellar haemorrhages and infarcts was performed to compare their difference in 6-month outcomes and to identify factors which affect outcomes. Patients were dichotomised into groups with good outcomes (mRS 0-3) or poor outcomes (mRS 4-6). Sex, age, pre-operative GCS, Charleston comorbidity index, time to surgery, intraventricular haemorrhage, surgical complications, length of ICU and hospital stay, shunt dependence and tracheostomy rates were analysed.


RESULTS
126 patients were recruited: 76 in haemorrhage group and 50 in infarct group. There was a higher mortality in the haemorrhage group (p = 0.0730). At 6 months, more patients in the haemorrhage group had poor outcomes (p = 0.0074, OR 3.04) and higher mortality (p = 0.0730, OR 2.20). More patients in the haemorrhage group required a tracheostomy (p = 0.0245). Factors predictive of poor outcome include older age (p = 0.0108), GCS ≤ 8 (p = 0.0011) and tracheostomy (p = 0.0269). 69.2% of patients had improvements in mRS at 6 months. Shorter length of stay (p = 0.0003) and discharge to a rehabilitation hospital (p = 0.0001) were predictive of functional improvement.


CONCLUSION
Patients who underwent posterior fossa surgery for cerebellar haemorrhages had worse outcomes compared to patients with cerebellar infarcts and were more likely to require a tracheostomy. Rehabilitation helped to improved outcomes.",Daniel Loh;Nicolas Kon Kam King

301,Arash Fassihi,"In natural environments, choices frequently must be made on the basis of complex and ambiguous streams of sensory input. There are advantages inherent to rapid decision making. Choices are better grounded, however, if information is acquired and accumulated over time. In primate visual motion perception, sensory evidence is accumulated up to a limit, at which point the brain commits to a choice. Recalling the models evoked for primate visual perception, recent studies in the rat vibrissal sensorimotor system, using a number of behavioral paradigms, show that perceptual decision making is characterized by the integration of sensory evidence over time. In this integrative process, vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (vS1 and vS2) act not as the integrator, but as the distributor of sensory information to downstream regions.",Yangfang Zuo;Mathew E Diamond

To study the role of 18FDG- PET (Flourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) in a) determining the extent of cranial and extra-cranial disease and b) diagnosis as well as prognosis of CNS TB (central nervous system tuberculosis) including TBM (tuberculous meningitis).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
This prospective observational study (n = 70) was carried out at a tertiary care institute in Northern India from 1.1.2017 to 30.6.2018. Diagnosis of TBM was made according to modified Ahuja's criteria. All patients were evaluated in detail and treated as per standard guidelines. All patients underwent 18FDG-PET scanning of brain and whole body at baseline.


RESULTS
Mean age was 35.2 ± 14.8 years. There were 37 men. Majority of patients (n = 47; 67.1%) were below 40 years of age. 43 (61.4%) patients were in stage II TBM. The mean duration of illness was 77 ± 101.9 days. Majority of patients presented with fever (94.3%), headache (90%) and vomiting (84.3%). MRI was abnormal at baseline in 67 (95.7%) of patients, most common abnormalities being meningeal enhancement (68.6%) and tuberculomas (57.1%). PET was abnormal in 66 (95.7%) of patients. All these patients had either lung lesions (n = 62, 88.6%) or lymphadenopathy (n = 61; 87.1%). 18FDG-PET revealed evidence of brain lesions in 52 (74.3%) patients. It revealed vertebral involvement in 19 (27.1%) and genitourinary lesions in 9 (12.9%) patients. PET evidence of lymphadenopathy correlated significantly (p = .04) with good outcome in CNS TB. Conclusion 18FDG-PET does seem to have a promising role in initial evaluation of patients with CNS TB.",Manoj K Goyal;Bhagwant R Mittal;Apurva Sood;Harmandeep Singh;Sameer Vyas;Kusum Sharma;Navneet Sharma;Rajendra Kumar;Alex Rebello;Dhawal Narang;Naresh Tandyala;Nandita Prabhat;Shelly Dutta;Manish Modi;Vivek Lal
304,Natalie Frederick,"In the past five years, the surrounding of the brain, that is the meninges (singular meninx) have evolved from being a physical barrier that protects the brain parenchyma to becoming a central player for both the maintenance of normal brain function and the modulation of neurological disorders. Indeed, the meninges are an immunologically active compartment that communicates with the periphery via the (re)discovered meningeal lymphatic system. From its ties to both the periphery and the central nervous system, the meninges are becoming a prevalent organ to understand and modulate brain homeostasis. Here we will focus on current advances in our understanding of the meningeal compartment with an emphasis on the meningeal lymphatic network as a key regulator.",Antoine Louveau

307,Urvashi Singh,"Background: Malignant otitis externa or skull base osteomyelitis arises as a complication of otological infection in immunocompromised individuals, especially elderly diabetics. With increasing awareness of the disease and better diagnostic modalities, there has been an increased reporting of atypical osteomyelitis of skull base (AOSB). Atypical osteomyelitis of skull base is a relatively rare yet an emerging clinical entity that also occurs in immunocompromised elderly individuals, however, in the absence of a pre-existing otological or rhinological infection. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical presentation and treatment protocol followed in patients diagnosed with atypical skull base osteomyelitis.Methods: A retrospective audit of medical records of patients diagnosed with AOSB between 2014 and 2018 was done. Clinical presentation and radiological assessment done prior to intervention was noted. All patients underwent transnasal endoscopic biopsy of tissue from clivus. Histopathological and microbiological profiling of biopsied tissue and treatment protocol followed was noted.Results: A total of 10 patients were included in the study out of which eight were male and two female. Eight patients were known diabetics and one patient had been on chronic oral steroid use. Majority presented with a vague dull aching headache and with one or more cranial nerve (CN) palsy(s). Radiological imaging showed clival involvement for all. All were managed conservatively with appropriate antibiotics. Disease resolution was defined as either complete resolution of symptoms and/or no residual lesion noted on follow-up MRI of skull base.Conclusions: Individuals presenting with non-specific symptoms of headache with CN palsy(s) with no obvious otological/rhinological infections, should raise suspicion of atypical skull base osteomyelitis. Histopathological diagnosis and microbiological assessment are an essential aid in conservative management with higher antibiotics. Patient compliance and long-term follow-up is essential for adequate and complete resolution of disease.",Shruti Venkitachalam;Rayappa Chinnusamy

The safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for CM-related acute cerebral embolism are not clear. Methods: We report a case of a 55-year-old woman who suffered a CM-related acute cerebral embolism presented with pure pontine infarcts and achieved a favorable prognosis by IVT with urokinase. We summarized the clinical data of this entity and performed a literature review of 21 previous reports of patients with CM-related acute cerebral embolism who were treated with IVT. Results: In combination with previous reports, we found that the majority of patients (81.8%) obtained improvements in symptoms after IVT, including 63.6% in remarkable clinical improvement. The total rate of IVT-induced intracerebral hemorrhage was 22.7% and all occurred within 36 h, including hemorrhagic infarction type 1 (4.5%) and parenchymal hematoma type 2 (18.2%). Most of the cases had relatively good outcomes and no case died due to IVT. Conclusion: Taken together, our findings support the use of IVT as an effective and safe tool for the ultra-early treatment of CM-related acute phase ischemic stroke.",Yusong Ge;Jinwei Li;Kailei Fu;Liyang Zhang;Weiyu Teng;Li Tian

310,Helia Mahzoun Alzakerin,"BACKGROUND
Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, neurological disorder that results in both cognitive and physical impairments. These impairments affect an individual's gait and, as the disease progresses, it significantly alters one's stability. Previous research found that changes in stride time patterns can help delineate between healthy and pathological gait. Autoregressive (AR) modeling is a statistical technique that models the underlying temporal patterns in data. Here the AR models assessed differences in gait stride time pattern stability between the controls and individuals with HD. Differences in stride time pattern stability were determined based on the AR model coefficients and their placement on a stationarity triangle that provides a visual representation of how the patterns mean, variance and autocorrelation change with time. Thus, individuals who exhibit similar stride time pattern stability will reside in the same region of the stationarity triangle. It was hypothesized that individuals with HD would exhibit a more altered stride time pattern stability than the controls based on the AR model coefficients and their location in the stationarity triangle.


METHODS
Sixteen control and twenty individuals with HD performed a five-minute walking protocol. Time series' were constructed from consecutive stride times extracted during the protocol and a second order AR model was fit to the stride time series data. A two-sample t-test was performed on the stride time pattern data to identify differences between the control and HD groups.


RESULTS
The individuals with HD exhibited significantly altered stride time pattern stability than the controls based on their AR model coefficients (AR1 p < 0.001; AR2 p < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
The AR coefficients successfully delineated between the controls and individuals with HD. Individuals with HD resided closer to and within the oscillatory region of the stationarity triangle, which could be reflective of the oscillatory neuronal activity commonly observed in this population. The ability to quantitatively and visually detect differences in stride time behavior highlights the potential of this approach for identifying gait impairment in individuals with HD.",Yannis Halkiadakis;Kristin D Morgan
311,Miguel Quintas-Neves,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Recently, primary age-related tauopathy (PART) has been described as a new anatomopathological disorder where NFTs are the main feature in the absence of neuritic plaques. However, since PART has mainly been studied in post-mortem patient brains, not much is known about the clinical or neuroimaging characteristics of PART. Here, we studied the clinical brain imaging characteristics of PART focusing on neuroanatomical vulnerability by applying a previously validated multiregion visual atrophy scale. We analysed 26 cases with confirmed PART with paired clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. In this selected cohort we found that upon correcting for the effect of age, there is increased atrophy in the medial temporal region with increasing Braak staging (r = 0.3937, p = 0.0466). Upon controlling for Braak staging effect, predominantly two regions, anterior temporal (r = 0.3638, p = 0.0677) and medial temporal (r = 0.3836, p = 0.053), show a trend for increased atrophy with increasing age. Moreover, anterior temporal lobe atrophy was associated with decreased semantic memory/language (r = - 0.5823, p = 0.0056; and r = - 0.6371, p = 0.0019, respectively), as was medial temporal lobe atrophy (r = - 0.4445, p = 0.0435). Overall, these findings support that PART is associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy and predominantly affects semantic memory/language. These findings highlight that other factors associated with aging and beyond NFTs could be involved in PART pathophysiology.",Merilee A Teylan;Lilah Besser;João Soares-Fernandes;Charles N Mock;Walter A Kukull;John F Crary;Tiago Gil Oliveira
312,Kuo-Hsuan Chang,"Previous genome-wide association studies in Caucasians suggest genetic loci of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR region may be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these gene-disease associations were limitedly reported in Asian populations. Herein, we investigated the effects of 5 top PD-associated genetic variants within HLA-DR region in Caucasians, including rs4248166, rs9268515, rs2395163, rs75855844, and rs660895, by genotyping 486 Taiwanese patients with PD and 473 age-matched control subjects. Although the association between rs2395163 C allele and patients with PD demonstrated marginal significance (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99, p = 0.045). The frequency of rs2395163 C allele (8.65%) in male patients with PD was significantly lower than in male control subjects (14.02%; OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.39-0.88, p = 0.009). The genetic associations between patients with PD and other tested genetic variants were negative. Although strong linkage disequilibrium (rs4248166-rs9626515-s2395163 and rs9626515-rs660895) were observed, the haplotype analysis did not find any significant risk-associated allelic combinations.

313,Tsai-Wei Liu,"Several genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses on Parkinson's disease (PD)-related genes have identified several risk foci in Ras-related genes, particularly among Caucasian individuals. However, the corresponding results have been controversial among Asian individuals. We investigated whether 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of Ras-related genes, RIT2 (rs12456492) and RAB7L1 (rs823118), are associated with PD risk in Taiwanese individuals. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of all studies related to rs12456492 in Asian populations to resolve inconsistency in this locus. In total, 1103 Taiwanese individuals (588 patients with PD and 515 controls) and 1111 Taiwanese individuals (594 patients with PD and 517 controls) were genotyped for rs12456492 and rs823118. However, we could not confirm the association of rs12456492 and rs823118 with PD. Our current meta-analysis involving the rs12456492(A/G) variant demonstrated that the GG + GA genotypes, GG genotypes, and G allele may be risk factors for PD. RIT2 may increase PD risk in Asian individuals. The discrepancies between Caucasian and Asian populations may be due to differences in geographic region-specific genetic backgrounds and gene-environmental interactions.",Yih-Ru Wu;Yi-Chun Chen;Hon Chung Fung;Chiung-Mei Chen
314,Dilek Cebeci,"Ictal pouting (Chapeau de gendarme sign) can be described as an inverted smile. It consists of a turned down mouth with the contraction of the chin, wrinkling of the lips and symmetrical lowering of the labial commissures. This shape resembles the gendarme's hat during Napoléon I's time. Chapeau de gendarme sign is frequently seen in frontal and temporal lobe seizures. Focal cortical dysplasias are intrinsically epileptogenic foci and are frequently seen in patients with ictal pouting in seizure semiology. In this report, we analyzed clinical data, video EEG recordings and brain imagings of three children presenting with ictal pouting semiology in whom patients' magnetic resonans images (MRIs) or positron emission tomographies (PETs) were positive or doubtful for FCD in all. In case 1 and 2 the epileptogenic zones were temporal or temporoinsular. In these patients, with involvement of temporal lobe, dystonia and automatisms were seen in the seizure semiology after chapeau de gendarme sign. In case 3 with frontal lobe origin, hypermotor movements were seen after ictal pouting. In the patients 1 and 2, the cortical dysplasias were in temporal lobe. In patient 3, PET demonstrated hypometabolism on left inferior frontal gyrus but we couldn't verify this finding with MRIs. Ictal pouting (Chapeau de gendarme sign) is a distinct seizure semiology that can often be overlooked and coexist with focal cortical thickening. We suggest that focal cortical dysplasias should be searched in patients with ictal pouting particularly in those with refractory focal seizures.",Ebru Arhan;Tugba Hirfanoglu;Zeynep Selen Karalok;Hakan Ercelebi;Özge Dedeoğlu;Lutfiye Ozlem Atay;Murat Ucar;Ayse Serdaroğlu
315,Giovanni Assenza,"OBJECTIVES
Imaging and neurophysiological data shows that the cortical disfunction caused by focal epilepsy is not limited to the epileptic focus, thus raising the modern vision of focal epilepsy as a network disorder. The involvement of deep thalamo-cortical projections in temporal lobe epilepsy is a clear example. We aimed at demonstrating the interictal functional impairment of thalamo-cortical network in drug-naïve TLE patients through the study of high frequency oscillations of somatosensory evoked potentials (HF-SEP).


METHODS
Twelve healthy controls (HC; 8 females, 52.2 ± 17.3 years-old) and 12 drug-naïve TLE patients (8 females, 55.5 ± 21.5 years-old) underwent bilateral median HF-SEP, recorded by scalp electrodes. Cp3'-Fz and Cp4'-Fz traces were filtered (400-800 Hz) to evidence HF-SEP.


RESULTS
HF-SEP duration in the affected hemisphere was significantly longer when compared to that of both the unaffected hemisphere and HC hemispheres. No significant inter-hemispheric differences were found in areas, powers and latencies of HF-SEP wavelets.


CONCLUSION
Our results demonstrate that TLE induces early interictal functional impairments of the thalamo-cortical network.

316,Mario Stampanoni Bassi,"OBJECTIVES
Skill acquisition after motor training involves synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in primary motor cortex (M1). In multiple sclerosis (MS), LTP failure ensuing from neuroinflammation could contribute to worsen clinical recovery. We therefore addressed whether practice-dependent plasticity is altered in MS.


METHODS
Eighteen relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS patients and eighteen healthy controls performed 600 fast abductions of index finger in 30 blocks of 20 movements. Before and after practice, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered over the hot spot of the trained first dorsal interosseous muscle. Movements kinematics, measures of cortical excitability, and the input/output curves of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were assessed.


RESULTS
Kinematic variables of movement improved with practice in patients and controls to a similar extent, although patients showed lower MEPs amplitude increase after practice. Practice did not change the difference in resting motor threshold values observed between patients and controls, nor did modulate short-interval intracortical inhibition. Clinical/radiological characteristics were not associated to practice-dependent effects.


CONCLUSIONS
Practice-induced reorganization of M1 is altered in non-disabled RR-MS patients, as shown by impaired MEPs modulation after motor learning.


SIGNIFICANCE
These findings suggest that in RR-MS physiological mechanisms of practice-dependent plasticity are altered.",Fabio Buttari;Pierpaolo Maffei;Nicla De Paolis;Andrea Sancesario;Luana Gilio;Luigi Pavone;Gabriele Pasqua;Ilaria Simonelli;Francesco Sica;Roberta Fantozzi;Paolo Bellantonio;Diego Centonze;Ennio Iezzi
317,C Warren Olanow,"BACKGROUND
Many patients with Parkinson's disease have potentially disabling off episodes that are not predictably responsive to levodopa. In this study, we assessed the safety and efficacy of apomorphine sublingual film as an on-demand therapy for off episodes in patients with Parkinson's disease.


METHODS
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was done by movement disorder specialists at 32 sites in the USA and one in Canada. Patients with Parkinson's disease who had 2 h or more of off time per day with predictable morning off periods, were responsive to levodopa, and were on stable doses of anti-parkinsonian medication were eligible. In an open-label titration phase, increasing doses of apomorphine sublingual film (10-35 mg) were administered until a tolerable full on response was achieved. Patients were then randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive web-response system to receive the effective dose of apomorphine sublingual film or matching placebo in a 12-week, double-blind maintenance phase. Randomisation was not stratified, and the block size was four. All patients and study personnel were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was the in-clinic change from predose to 30 min post-dose in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part 3 (motor) score at week 12, analysed on a modified intention-to-treat population by use of a mixed-effect model for repeated measures. Safety analyses were done on all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02469090.


FINDINGS
Between June 18, 2015, and Dec 11, 2017, 109 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive apomorphine sublingual film (n=54) or placebo (n=55). All patients received the assigned study treatment, and 34 (63%) of 54 patients receiving apomorphine sublingual film and 46 (84%) of 55 receiving placebo completed the study. Least squares mean (SE) change from predose to 30 min post-dose in MDS-UPDRS part 3 score at week 12 was -11·1 (SE 1·46, 95% CI -14·0 to -8·2) with apomorphine sublingual film and -3·5 (1·29, -6·1 to -0·9) with placebo (difference -7·6, SE 1·96, 95% CI -11·5 to -3·7; p=0·0002). Mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal events were the most common side-effect, reported in 17 (31%) of 54 patients receiving apomorphine sublingual film and in four (7%) of 55 patients receiving placebo, leading to treatment discontinuation in nine (17%) patients treated with apomorphine and in one (2%) patient treated with placebo. Other treatment-emergent adverse events were transient nausea (in 15 [28%] patients receiving apomorphine sublingual film), somnolence (seven [13%]), and dizziness (five [9%]). Orthostatic hypotension, syncope, dyskinesia, hallucinations, prolongation of the QT interval, and impulse control disorders were infrequent (prevalence ≤2% of all patients) or did not occur. One patient treated with apomorphine sublingual film (with known cardiac risk factors) had a fatal cardiac arrest.


INTERPRETATION
Although nearly a third of patients discontinued treatment primarily because of oropharyngeal side-effects, apomorphine sublingual film provided an efficacious, on-demand treatment for off episodes for most patients with Parkinson's disease in this trial. The long-term safety and efficacy of apomorphine sublingual film are currently being investigated.

318,Pin Kwang Tan,"Despite the discovery of gene variants linked to memory performance, understanding the genetic basis of adult human memory remains a challenge. Here, we devised an unsupervised framework that relies on spatial correlations between human transcriptome data and functional neuroimaging maps to uncover the genetic signatures of memory in functionally-defined cortical and subcortical memory regions. Results were validated with animal literature and showed that our framework is highly effective in identifying memory-related processes and genes compared to a control cognitive function. Genes preferentially expressed in cortical memory regions are linked to memory-related processes such as immune and epigenetic regulation. Genes expressed in subcortical memory regions are associated with neurogenesis and glial cell differentiation. Genes expressed in both cortical and subcortical memory areas are involved in the regulation of transcription, synaptic plasticity and glutamate receptor signalling. Furthermore, distinct memory-associated genes such as PRKCD and CDK5 are linked to cortical and subcortical regions respectively. Thus, cortical and subcortical memory regions exhibit distinct genetic signatures that potentially reflect functional differences in health and disease, and nominates gene candidates for future experimental investigations.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The anatomical and functional aspects of human memory are well characterized, but its biological mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, to uncover genetic signatures associated with human memory function, we analyzed spatial correlations between micro-scale gene expression and macro-scale neuroimaging maps to derive memory-related biological processes and genes in an unsupervised manner. We found the gene signatures of cortical and subcortical memory to be largely distinct and are associated with memory. We identified less characterized memory-associated genes as well. Furthermore, our framework demonstrated effectiveness and precision in identifying gene signatures related to memory versus another function as a control. Overall, our work provides a human-centric approach to understanding the genetics of cognition, and identifies potential gene candidates for future experimental investigations.",Egor Ananyev;Po-Jang Brown Hsieh
319,Sara Teller,"Damage in biological neuronal networks triggers a complex functional reorganization whose mechanisms are still poorly understood. To delineate this reorganization process, here we investigate the functional alterations of in vitro rat cortical circuits following localized laser ablation. The analysis of the functional network configuration before and after ablation allowed us to quantify the extent of functional alterations and the characteristic spatial and temporal scales along recovery. We observed that damage precipitated a fast rerouting of information flow that restored network's communicability in about 15 min. Functional restoration was led by the immediate neighbors around trauma but was orchestrated by the entire network. Our in vitro setup exposes the ability of neuronal circuits to articulate fast responses to acute damage, and may serve as a proxy to devise recovery strategies in actual brain circuits. Moreover, this biological setup can become a benchmark to empirically test network theories about the spontaneous recovery in dynamical networks.Significance Statement Given the sheer size of the brain, in vitro models in the form of neuronal cultures have emerged as a promising tool to investigate dynamic and network alterations in detail upon physical damage. Here we present a new experimental paradigm based on the combination of laser microsurgery and calcium fluorescence imaging to analyze network functional alterations after a focal lesion. We show that the network is not only able to cope with damage but that the regions around the lesion core actively participate in recovery, restoring the initial network activity levels in just 15 min. Our approach offers interesting perspectives for modeling network functional loss and recovery in a number of damage actions, from stroke to degenerative disorders.",Estefanía Estévez-Priego;Clara Granell;Daniel Tornero;Jordi Andilla;Omar E Olarte;Pablo Loza-Alvarez;Alex Arenas;Jordi Soriano

To test the hypothesis that the inflammatory marker plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) associates with incident dementia and related endophenotypes in 2 community-based cohorts.


METHODS
Our samples included the prospective community-based Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) cohorts. Plasma sCD14 was measured at baseline and related to the incidence of dementia, domains of cognitive function, and MRI-defined brain volumes. Follow-up for dementia occurred over a mean of 10 years (SD 4) in the FHS and a mean of 6 years (SD 3) in the CHS.


RESULTS
We studied 1,588 participants from the FHS (mean age 69 ± 6 years, 47% male, 131 incident events) and 3,129 participants from the CHS (mean age 72 ± 5 years, 41% male, 724 incident events) for the risk of incident dementia. Meta-analysis across the 2 cohorts showed that each SD unit increase in sCD14 was associated with a 12% increase in the risk of incident dementia (95% confidence interval 1.03-1.23; p = 0.01) following adjustments for age, sex, APOE ε4 status, and vascular risk factors. Higher levels of sCD14 were associated with various cognitive and MRI markers of accelerated brain aging in both cohorts and with a greater progression of brain atrophy and a decline in executive function in the FHS.

Occlusions of the primary venous outlets likely resulted in engorgement of the deep venous system. The segmental anatomy of the shunting basal vein is critical to the clinical presentation and may range from basal ganglia or brainstem oedema/infarctions to uniquely, as in our case, isolated intraventricular haemorrhage secondary to variceal rupture.

This study retrospectively analyzed the risk factors, management strategies, and complications of incomplete stent apposition (ISA) of low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS) stents after initial deployment in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms.


METHODS
The clinical characteristics of ISA or wall apposition (WA) of LVIS stent after initial deployment were analyzed. The risk factors of ISA were identified using univariate logistic regression analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The clinical characteristics of ISA following different management strategies were also shown.


RESULTS
The retrospective study enrolled 303 patients with 315 LVIS stent-assisted aneurysms. Fifty-nine patients with 59 stents showed ISA after initial deployment. At the end of the study, the presence of ISA was only observed in eight patients (2.5%). The stent-subtended arc angle (>90) and the aneurysm of the internal carotid artery (ICA) were associated with ISA. The stent-subtended arc angle (>90) and stent size (4.5*20 mm) were independent risk factors of ISA. The incidence of thromboembolic events in the ISA group was significantly higher than that in the WA group. After the treatment of ISA, there was no significant difference in good outcomes between patients with ISA and those with WA after initial deployment.


CONCLUSIONS
ISA is more likely to occur at tortuous vessels. The stent-subtended arc angle (>90) and LVIS size (4.5*20 mm) were independent risk factors of ISA. ISA led to significantly increased incidence of thromboembolic events. However, ISA after initial deployment did not affect the patient's prognosis.",Xiaoping Gao;Hui Liang;Yi Ren

The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used measure of ischemic change on non-contrast CT. Although predictive of long-term outcome, ASPECTS is limited by its modest interobserver agreement. One potential solution to this is the use of machine learning strategies, such as e-ASPECTS, to detect ischemia. Here, we compared e-ASPECTS with manual scoring by experienced neuroradiologists for all 10 individual ASPECTS regions.

We retrospectively reviewed 178 baseline non-contrast CT scans from patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular thrombectomy. All scans were reviewed by two independent neuroradiologists with a third reader arbitrating disagreements for a consensus read. Each ASPECTS region was scored individually. All scans were then evaluated using a machine learning-based software package (e-ASPECTS, Brainomix). Interobserver agreement between readers and the software for each region was calculated with a kappa statistic.


RESULTS
The median ASPECTS was 9 for manual scoring and 8.5 for e-ASPECTS, with an overall agreement of κ=0.248. Regional agreement varied from κ=0.094 (M1) to κ=0.555 (lentiform), with better performance in subcortical regions. When corrected for the low number of infarcts in any given region, prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa ranged from 0.483 (insula) to 0.888 (M3), with greater agreement for cortical areas. Intraclass correlation coefficients were between 0.09 (M1) and 0.556 (lentiform).


CONCLUSION
Manual scoring and e-ASPECTS had fair agreement in our dataset on a per-region basis. This warrants further investigation using follow-up scans or MRI as the gold standard measure of true ASPECTS.",Seyed Mohammad Seyedsaadat;David Mihal;John Benson;Ian Mark;David F Kallmes;Waleed Brinjikji
325,Anne-Laure Kaminsky,"INTRODUCTION
While telestroke allows early intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for ischemic strokes in spoke centers, mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for large vessel occlusion (LVO) is mainly performed at comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs). We aimed to compare 3 month outcome in patients with LVO after admission to a spoke center using telestroke compared with first CSC admission in our large regional stroke network, irrespective of final treatment decision.


METHODS
All consecutive LVO patients who were admitted to one of six spoke centers or to the regional CSC within 6 hours of symptom onset were prospectively included from September 1, 2015 to August 31, 2017. All patients admitted to spoke centers were assessed on site with cerebral and vessel imaging. Primary outcome was 3 month favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2).


RESULTS
Distances between spoke centers and CSC ranged from 36 to 77 miles. Among 207 included patients, 132 (63.8%) were first admitted to CSCs and 75 (36.2%) to spoke centers. IVT was administered more in spoke centers (81.3% vs 53.8%, p<0.0001) while MT was performed less (26.7% vs 49.2%, p=0.001) and with a longer time from onset (303 vs 200 min, p<0.0001). No difference was found in 3 month favorable outcome between spoke centers compared with CSCs (32.0% and 35.1%, respectively; OR=0.68; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.10; p=0.12).


CONCLUSIONS
Despite different distribution of reperfusion therapies for LVO patients managed by telemedicine, we could not demonstrate a difference in functional outcome according to admission location in a large area with long distances between centers.",Gioia Mione;Yacoubou Omorou;Lisa Humbertjean;Mathieu Bonnerot;Jean Christophe Lacour;Nolwenn Riou-Comte;Mohammad Anadani;Benjamin Gory;Sébastien Richard
326,Aiwu Cheng,"Impaired mitochondrial function and aberrant neuronal network activity are believed to be early events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how mitochondrial alterations contribute to aberrant activity in neuronal circuits is unknown. In this study, we examined the function of mitochondrial protein deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in the pathogenesis of AD. Compared to AppPs1 mice, Sirt3-haploinsufficient AppPs1 mice (Sirt3+/-AppPs1) exhibit early epileptiform EEG activity and Seizure. Both male and female Sirt3+/-AppPs1 mice were observed to die prematurely before five months of age. When comparing male mice among different genotypes, Sirt3 haploinsufficiency renders GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex vulnerable to degeneration and associated neuronal network hyperexcitability. Feeding Sirt3+/-AppPs1 AD mice with a ketone ester-rich diet increases SIRT3 expression and prevents seizure-related death and the degeneration of GABAergic neurons, indicating that the aggravated GABAergic neuron loss and neuronal network hyperexcitability in Sirt3+/-AppPs1 mice are caused by SIRT3 reduction and can be rescued by increase of SIRT3 expression. Consistent with a protective role in AD, SIRT3 levels are reduced in association with cerebral cortical Aβ pathology in AD patients. In summary, SIRT3 preserves GABAergic interneurons and protects cerebral circuits against hyperexcitability, and this neuroprotective mechanism can be bolstered by dietary ketone esters.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGABAergic neurons provide the main inhibitory control of neuronal activity in the brain. By preserving mitochondrial function, SIRT3 protects parvalbumin and calretinin interneurons against Aβ-associated dysfunction and degeneration in AppPs1 AD mice, thus restraining neuronal network hyperactivity. The neuronal network dysfunction that occurs in AD can be partially reversed by physiological, dietary, and pharmacological interventions to increase SIRT3 expression and enhance the functionality of GABAergic interneurons.",Jing Wang;Nathaniel Ghena;Qijin Zhao;Isabella Perone;M Todd King;Richard L Veech;Myriam Gorospe;Ruiqian Wan;Mark P Mattson
327,Federico Pedraja,"Perception and motor control traditionally are studied separately. However, motor activity can serve as a scaffold to shape the sensory flow. This tight link between motor actions and sensing is particularly evident in active sensory systems. Here, we investigate how the weakly electric mormyrid fish Gnathonemus petersii of undetermined sex structure their sensing and motor behavior while learning a perceptual task. We find systematic adjustments of the motor behavior that correlate with an increased performance. Using a model to compute the electrosensory input, we show that these behavioural adjustments improve the sensory input. As we find low neuronal detection thresholds at the level of medullary electrosensory neurons, it seems that the behavior-driven improvements of the sensory input are highly suitable to overcome the sensory limitations, thereby increasing the sensory range. Our results show that motor control is an active component of sensory learning, demonstrating that a detailed understanding of contribution of motor actions to sensing is needed to understand even seemingly simple behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMotor-guided sensation and perception are intertwined, with motor behavior serving as a scaffold to shape the sensory input. We characterized how the weakly electric mormyrid fish G. petersii, as it learns a perceptual task, restructures its sensorimotor behavior. We find that systematic adjustments of the motor behavior correlate with increased performance and a shift of the animal's sensory attention. Analyzing the afferent electrosensory input shows that a significant gain in information results from these sensorimotor adjustments. Our results show that motor control can be an active component of sensory learning. Researching the sensory corollaries of motor control thus can be crucial to understand sensory sensation and perception under naturalistic conditions.",Volker Hofmann;Julie Goulet;Jacob Engelmann
328,Jennifer Bialecki,"The impact of pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels on synaptic transmission is poorly understood. Here, we show that selective block of Panx1 in single postsynaptic hippocampal CA1 neurons from male rat or mouse brain slices causes intermittent, seconds long increases in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) following Schaffer collateral stimulation. The increase in sEPSC frequency occurred without an effect on evoked neurotransmission. Consistent with a pre-synaptic origin of the augmented glutamate release, the increased sEPSC frequency was prevented by bath applied EGTA-AM or tetrodotoxin. Manipulation of a previously described metabotropic NMDAR pathway (i.e. by preventing ligand binding to NMDARs with competitive antagonists or blocking downstream Src kinase) also increased sEPSC frequency similar to that seen when Panx1 was blocked. This facilitated glutamate release was absent in TRPV1 knockout mice and prevented by the TRPV1 antagonist, capsazapine, suggesting it required presynaptic TRPV1. We show presynaptic expression of TRPV1 by immunoelectron microscopy and link TRPV1 to Panx1 because Panx1 block increases tissue levels of the endovanilloid, anandamide. Together, these findings demonstrate an unexpected role for metabotropic NMDARs and postsynaptic Panx1 in suppression of facilitated glutamate neurotransmission.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe postsynaptic ion and metabolite channel, pannexin-1 is regulated by metabotropic NMDAR signalling through Src kinase. This pathway suppresses facilitated release of presynaptic glutamate during synaptic activity by regulating tissue levels of the TRPV1 agonist anandamide.",Allison Werner;Nicholas L Weilinger;Catharine M Tucker;Haley A Vecchiarelli;Jon Egaña;Juan Mendizabal-Zubiaga;Pedro Grandes;Matthew N Hill;Roger J Thompson
329,Asheeta A Prasad,"The ventral pallidum (VP) is a key node in the neural circuits controlling relapse to drug seeking. How this role relates to different VP cell types and their projections is poorly understood. Using male rats, we show how different forms of relapse to alcohol-seeking are assembled from VP cell types and their projections to lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using RNAScope in situ hybridization to characterize activity of different VP cell types during relapse to alcohol-seeking provoked by renewal (context-induced reinstatement), we found that VP Gad1 and parvalbumin (PV), but not vGlut2, neurons show relapse-associated changes in c-Fos expression. Next, we used retrograde tracing, chemogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches to study the roles of VPGad1 and VPPV neurons in relapse. We show that VPGad1 neurons contribute to contextual control over relapse (renewal), but not to relapse during reacquisition, via projections to LH, where they converge with ventral striatal inputs onto LHGad1 neurons. This convergence of striatopallidal inputs at the level of individual LHGad1 neurons may be critical to balancing propensity for relapse versus abstinence. In contrast, VPPV neurons contribute to relapse during both renewal and reacquisition via projections to VTA. These findings identify a double dissociation in the roles for different VP cell types and their projections in relapse. VPGad1 neurons control relapse during renewal via projections to LH. VPPV neurons control relapse during both renewal and reacquisition via projections to VTA. Targeting these different pathways may provide tailored interventions for different forms of relapse.",Caroline Xie;Chanchanok Chaichim;Jennifer H Nguyen;Hannah E McClusky;Simon Killcross;John M Power;Gavan P McNally
330,Sebastian M Frank,"Previous studies in human subjects reported that the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), a core area of the vestibular cortex, is inhibited when visual processing is prioritized. However, it has remained unclear, which networks in the brain modulate this inhibition of PIVC. Based on previous results showing that the inhibition of PIVC is strongly influenced by visual attention, we here examined whether attention networks in the parietooccipital cortex modulate the inhibition of PIVC. Using diffusion weighted and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a group of female and male subjects we found structural and functional connections between PIVC and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a major brain region of the cortical attention network. We then temporarily inhibited PPC by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and hypothesized that the modulatory influence of PPC over PIVC would be reduced and, as a result, PIVC would be less inhibited. Subjects performed a visual attentional tracking task immediately after rTMS and the inhibition of PIVC during attentive tracking was measured with functional MRI. The results showed that the inhibition of PIVC during attentive tracking was less pronounced compared with sham rTMS. We also examined the effects of inhibitory rTMS over the occipital cortex (OC) and found that the visual-vestibular posterior insular cortex area (PIC) was less activated during attentive tracking compared with sham rTMS or rTMS over PPC. Taken together, these results suggest that attention networks in the parietooccipital cortex modulate activity in core areas of the vestibular cortex during attentive visual processing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAlthough multisensory integration is generally considered beneficial, it can become detrimental when cues from different senses are in conflict. The occurrence of such multisensory conflicts can be minimized by inhibiting core cortical areas of the subordinate sensory system (e.g., vestibular), thus reducing potential conflict with on-going processing of the prevailing sensory (e.g., visual) cues. However, it has remained unclear which networks in the brain modulate the magnitude of inhibition of the subordinate sensory system. Here, by investigating the inhibition of the vestibular sensory system when visual processing is prioritized, we show that attention networks in the parietooccipital cortex modulate the magnitude of inhibition of the vestibular cortex.",Maja Pawellek;Lisa Forster;Berthold Langguth;Martin Schecklmann;Mark W Greenlee
331,Francesca Grassivaro,"Differently, from other myeloid cells, microglia derive exclusively from precursors originating within the yolk sac (YS) and migrating to the central nervous system (CNS) under development, without any contribution from fetal liver or postnatal hematopoiesis. Consistent with their unique ontology, microglia may express specific physiological markers, which have been partly described in recent years. Here we wondered whether profiles distinguishing microglia from peripheral macrophages vary with age and under pathology. To this goal, we profiled transcriptomes of microglia throughout the lifespan and included a parallel comparison with peripheral macrophages under physiological and neuroinflammatory settings using age and sex-matched wild type and bone marrow chimera mouse models. This comprehensive approach demonstrated that the phenotypic differentiation between microglia and peripheral macrophages is age-dependent and that peripheral macrophages do express some of the most commonly described microglia-specific markers early during development, such as Fcrls, P2ry12, Tmem119, and Trem2. Further, during chronic neuroinflammation CNS-infiltrating macrophages and not peripheral myeloid cells acquire microglial markers, indicating that the CNS niche may instruct peripheral myeloid cells to gain the phenotype and, presumably, the function of the microglia cell. In conclusion, our data provide further evidence about the plasticity of the myeloid cell and suggest caution in the strict definition and application of microglia-specific markers.Significant StatementUnderstanding the respective role of microglia and infiltrating monocytes in neuroinflammatory conditions has recently seemed possible by the identification of a specific microglia signature. Here instead we provide evidence that peripheral macrophages may express some of the most commonly described microglia markers at some developmental stages or pathological conditions, in particular during chronic neuroinflammation. Further, our data support the hypothesis about phenotypic plasticity and convergence among distinct myeloid cells so that they may act as a functional unit rather than as different entities, boosting their mutual functions in different phases of disease. This holds relevant implications in the view of the growing use of myeloid cell therapies to treat brain disease in humans.",Ramesh Menon;Massimo Acquaviva;Linda Ottoboni;Francesca Ruffini;Andrea Bergamaschi;Luca Muzio;Cinthia Farina;Gianvito Martino
332,Tae Young Yeo,"Purpose
The ability to convert scores between cognitive measurements would facilitate the longitudinal assessment of cognition in clinical practice and the comparison and synthesis of cognitive data from international, multicenter, or longitudinal studies. The primary aim of this study was to apply a simple and reliable method for converting scores from the Korean Dementia Screening Questionnaire (KDSQ) to those of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE).


Patients and methods
A total of 627 participants, with and without cognitive dysfunction, received both the KDSQ and the IQCODE at the same visit. The scores of both tools were calculated, and equipercentile equating was used to create a method for converting scores from the KDSQ to the IQCODE.


Results
KDSQ scores were highly correlated with IQCODE scores (Pearson r = 0.905, P < 0.01). We developed scores for converting the KDSQ to the IQCODE using equipercentile equating and log-linear smoothing. We provide an easy-to-use table that enables the conversion of KDSQ scores to IQCODE scores.


Conclusion
We delivered a simple and reliable method for converting scores from the KDSQ to the IQCODE. The conversion score table reported here enables direct and easy comparison of these cognitive measurements in older adults.",Keonyeup Kim;Moon Ho Park

Emerging evidence has suggested that green vegetables may prevent cognitive decline.


Methods
We examined the cross-sectional association between green vegetables intake and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using data from 525 participants aged 55 years and above from the China Longitudinal Aging Study (CLAS) in Shanghai.


Results
Compared with participants who did not eat green vegetables every day, those who had consumed green vegetables every day had a significantly lower risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (OR = 0.218, 95% CI, 0.116-0.411, p < 0.001), and this association was independent of age, education, having hobbies, surfing the Internet, sleep time per night (youth), long-term residency and consumption of specific red food, such as meat, bread, bean curd, and ginger.


Conclusion
In summary, using community-based data in Shanghai, we found out that subjects who eat green vegetables every day have significantly lower odds of MCI than those who do not eat every day. Based on current evidence, we propose that eating green vegetables every day might be a potential preventive measure to slow cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in the elderly.",Lin Sun;Ling Yue;Guanjun Li;Shifu Xiao
334,Weiwei Liang,"Background
Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by molecular and anatomical abnormalities of multiple brain regions. Our recent study showed that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota contributes to the onset of schizophrenia-relevant behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.


Purpose
This study aimed to investigate how gut microbiota shapes metabolic signatures in multiple brain regions of schizophrenia microbiota recipient mice.


Methods
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were used to compare the metabolic signatures in the cortex, cerebellum and striatum of schizophrenia microbiota and healthy microbiota recipient mice. Enrichment analysis was further conducted to uncover the crucial metabolic pathways related to schizophrenia-relevant behaviors.


Results
We found that the metabolic phenotypes of these three regions were substantially different in schizophrenia microbiota recipient mice from those in healthy microbiota recipient mice. In total, we identified 499 differential metabolites that could discriminate the two groups in the three brain regions. These differential metabolites were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid and fatty acyl metabolism. Moreover, we found four of fatty acyl metabolites that were consistently altered in the three brain regions.


Conclusion
Taken together, our study suggests that alterations of glycerophospholipid and fatty acyl metabolism are implicated in the onset of schizophrenia-relevant behaviors, which may provide a new understanding of the etiology of schizophrenia.",Yu Huang;Xunmin Tan;Jing Wu;Jiajia Duan;Hanping Zhang;Bangmin Yin;Yifan Li;Peng Zheng;Hong Wei;Peng Xie
335,Linghong Guo,"Purpose
Alcohol dependence (AD) is a relapsing mental disorder, typically occurring with concurrent tobacco misuse. Studies have reported disruption of the structural connectivity between hemispheres in the brain of individuals with AD. However, alterations in interhemispheric interactions and the specificity of frequency bands in individuals with AD remain unknown. Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) allows examination of functional interactions between mirrored interhemispheric voxels. Here, we use VMHC to investigate homotopic connectivity in AD and alcohol and nicotine co-dependence (AND) subjects.


Patients and methods
VMHC and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) in 24 AD, 30 AND, and 35 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy control (HC) subjects were calculated for different frequency bands (slow-5, slow-4, and typical bands).


Results
Individuals with AD demonstrated significantly reduced VMHC in bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL) and increased VMHC in bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) compared to that in HCs in the typical and slow-4 bands; higher VMHC in the MFG was positively correlated with the dependence-severity score. In all bands of the VMHC analysis, no significant differences were found between the AND and other groups. Subsequent seed-based FC analysis demonstrated all regions with abnormal VMHC exhibited altered FC with its counterpart in the contralateral hemisphere in the typical and slow-4 frequency bands. The FC value between bilateral CPL within AD subjects negatively correlated with alcohol intake.


Conclusion
Our findings provide further evidence of the role of disruptions within the brain circuitry supporting cognitive control in the development of AD. Alterations in neural activities in the CPL and MFG might be a biomarker of dependence severity in AD patients as assessed using clinical questionnaire and features. Because of the frequency specificity in VMHC, we must consider frequency effects in future AD functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.",Fuqing Zhou;Ning Zhang;Hongmei Kuang;Zhen Feng
336,Krzysztof Kucia,"Objective
One year observation and evaluation of the VNS (vagus nerve stimulation) efficacy and safety for patients with treatment resistant depression in Polish conditions.


Methods
An open label, uncontrolled and one center retrospective study of VNS therapy was implemented with stable pharmacotherapy in 6 patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). For the first 3 months, only VNS parameters were altered but the pharmacological treatment was unchanged and in the following 9 months, medication and VNS dosing parameters were altered according to the clinical state of the patients.


Results
The baseline 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24) score averaged 24. Both response (>50% reduction in baseline scores) and remission rates after 3 months of treatment were only 40%. After 1 year of VNS therapy, the response rates increased to 86%. Most frequent side-effects were voice alteration (86% at 3 months of stimulation) and headaches (40%).


Conclusion
VNS treatment was safe and effective in TRD patients and its efficacy increased with time. Efficacy ratings are similar to the previously reported studies using a congenial protocol.",Wojciech Merk;Krzysztof Zapalowicz;Tomasz Medrala
337,Paula Askalsky,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent condition associated with high rates of disability, as well as suicidal ideation and behavior. Current treatments for MDD have significant limitations in efficacy and side effect burden. FDA-approved devices for MDD are burdensome (due to repeated in-office procedures) and are most suitable for severely ill subjects. There is a critical need for device-based treatments in MDD that are efficacious, well-tolerated, and easy to use. In this paper, we review a novel neuromodulation strategy, transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) with near-infrared light (NIR). The scope of our review includes the known biological mechanisms of t-PBM, as well as its efficacy in animal models of depression and in patients with MDD. Theoretically, t-PBM penetrates into the cerebral cortex, stimulating the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and also significantly increases cerebral blood flow. Animal and human studies, using a variety of t-PBM settings and experimental models, suggest that t-PBM may have significant efficacy and good tolerability in MDD. In aggregate, these data support the need for large confirmatory studies for t-PBM as a novel, likely safe, and easy-to-administer antidepressant treatment.",Dan V Iosifescu
338,Jyotindra Narayan Goswami,"Drug-refractory epilepsy is a commonly prevalent pediatric neurological illness of global significance. Ketogenic diet (KD) is a time-tested therapeutic modality for refractory epilepsy, which has reemerged as a robust alternative to anti-epileptic pharmacotherapy. There is a growing body of evidence which supports the anti-seizure efficacy, safety profile and feasibility of KD use in childhood epilepsy. In addition, this modality has been recognized to reduce anti-epileptic exposure, improve cognition and behavioral profile of patients as well as improve the quality-of-life of care-givers. Current indications of KD include refractory epilepsy syndromes, selected metabolic disorders (such as pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency) and a host of varied neurological entities. KD research has broadened the knowledge-base about its mechanisms of action. Four types of KD are in vogue currently with varying nutritional constitution, palatability, administration protocols and comparable efficacy. KD initiation and maintenance are the result of concerted effort of a team of pediatric neurologist/epileptologist, nutritionist and patient's primary care-giver. Consensus is being formulated about various practical aspects of KD such as patient-selection, parental counseling, baseline work-up, dietary prescription, nutritional supplementation, concurrent anti-epileptic drug administration, follow-up and treatment-duration. Novel applications of KD include its use in neonatal epilepsy and super-refractory status epilepticus and tailor-made formulations such as cooking oil-based KD in predominantly rice-fed populations. Increasing body of clinical experience, improved nutritional designs and translational research are promoting KD as a major therapeutic modality. Currently, KD forms a core essence in the armamentarium against refractory epilepsy.

Empathy, in its affective and cognitive components, is a crucial interpersonal ability. It is broadly studied in the field of psychopathology, whereas its study in the neurodegenerative diseases is relatively recent. Existing literature, though, focused on a reduced subset of considered diseases, which often found a compromise in empathy abilities. Organized knowledge about a more comprehensive set of diseases is lacking.


Method
The present PRISMA systematic review was aimed at collecting the current available literature concerning empathic alterations in adult patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases. It considered the different empathy components, evaluated existing patterns, the impact on patients' lives, and treatment considerations.


Results
Overall, the 32 retrieved studies describe a spread deterioration of empathic abilities in patients, with each disease displaying its own pattern of empathy functioning. Literature in this field is fragmented and of heterogeneous quality, and further studies are warranted to increase evidence of many preliminary results.


Discussion
In conclusion, we highlight the crucial importance of acknowledging empathy deficits in these diseases, showing their repercussion on both patients' and caregivers' quality of life, the establishment of a functional doctor-patient relationship, and the development of efficacious psychological intervention. These clinical approaches can be enriched by the knowledge of the spared abilities of patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases.",Johann R Kleinbub;Stefania Mannarini;Arianna Palmieri

To determine the clinical characteristics and course of severe avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) in hospitalized children and adolescents and compare them with those of patients with restricting-type anorexia nervosa (R-AN).


Patients and methods
We conducted a retrospective chart review of inpatients diagnosed with ARFID or R-AN based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, at Jichi Children's Medical Center Tochigi between April 1, 2007 and March 31, 2017. We compared the characteristics of the ARFID and R-AN patients at admission, during hospitalization, and after discharge.


Results
Both the ARFID (n=13) and R-AN (n=79) patients required hospitalization for their medically unstable state. The features of ARFID group included concern about the aversive consequences of eating and avoidance of eating due to sensory concerns. Significant differences were found at admission between ARFID and R-AN groups in age (10.7 vs 12.7 years), family history of mental disorders (46.2% vs 17.7%), comorbid developmental disorders (6 vs 3 cases), and the time from onset to admission (3.9 vs 6.3 months). The body weight status, % ideal body weight (%IBW), % expected body weight (%EBW), <75% IBW rate, and <75% EBW rate did not differ significantly between the two groups at admission or discharge. The duration of post-discharge outpatient follow-up treatment did not differ significantly between ARFID and R-AN groups (15.3 vs 18.4 months); however, ARFID group recovery rate was significantly higher than that of R-AN group (77% vs 43%). The reasons that the patients with ARFID had significantly better outcomes than the R-AN patients remain unclear. Compared to those in previous studies, the present patients were younger and demonstrated better outcomes. Our results indicate that the body weight status is similar between ARFID and R-AN patients, but the ARFID patients achieved better outcomes.


Conclusion
These findings suggest that early onset in childhood, early disease recognition, and early intervention are important factors for achieving better outcomes for patients with ARFID.",Katsutoshi Shioda;Takaaki Abe;Rika Kato;Shizukiyo Ishikawa;Shiro Suda
341,David W Morris,"An approach viewing anxiety and depression as extensions of normal adaptive biologic drives is discussed. Anxiety is viewed as the result of an underlying biological drive to preserve and maintain our wellbeing. At the extremes, if unresolved, this drive can be maladaptive, particularly if activated over prolonged periods of time. This paper proposes that depression is the result of a biological drive that mediates the effects of maladaptive levels of anxiety. These two processes are thought to be acting simultaneously. When operating in the normal range, these drives are helpful; in the extremes, they are associated with impairment. Over time, if unresolved, symptoms of anxiety will begin to become associated with increasing levels of depression.",

Ischemic stroke often induces profound white matter lesions, resulting in poor neurological outcomes and impaired post-stroke recovery. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of cornel iridoid glycoside (CIG), a major active component extracted from Cornus officinalis, on the white matter injury induced by ischemic stroke and further investigate its neuroprotective mechanisms.


Methods
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery for 2 h, followed by reperfusion. Rats were intragastrically administered CIG (60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg) beginning 6 h afters reperfusion, once daily for seven days. A series of behavioral tests (modified neurological severity scores test, object recognition test, adhesive removal test, and beam walking test) were performed to evaluate the neurological functioning in MCAO rats. Histology of the white matter was studied using luxol fast blue staining and transmission electron microscopy. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess myelin loss, oligodendrocyte maturation, and glial activation. Activation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/neuregulin-1 (NRG1) pathway was evaluated by Western blotting.


Results
CIG treatment remarkably decreased the neurological deficit score, accelerated the recovery of somatosensory and motor functions, and ameliorated the memory deficit in MCAO rats. Furthermore, CIG alleviated white matter lesions and demyelination, increased myelin basic protein expression and the number of mature oligodendrocytes, and decreased the number of activated microglia and astrocytes in the corpus callosum of MCAO rats. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated that CIG increased the expression of BDNF/p-TrkB, NRG1/ErbB4 proteins, which further elevated PI3K p110α/p-Akt/p-mTOR signaling in the corpus callosum of MCAO rats.


Conclusion
We demonstrated that CIG protects against white matter lesions induced by cerebral ischemia partially by decreasing the number of activated microglia and astrocytes, increasing BDNF level, and activating NRG1/ErbB4 and its downstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways in the white matter. CIG might be used as a potential neuroprotective agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke.",Xuesi Hua;Hongmei Niu;Zhengyu Sun;Li Zhang;Yali Li;Lan Zhang;Lin Li
343,Koji Takeda,"Purpose
Employment is important for forensic psychiatric patients with psychotic disorders, in terms of reduction in symptoms, improving the quality of life, and preventing re-offenses. However, few detailed studies on employment status in such patients exist. We aimed to determine the employment rate among forensic psychiatric outpatients with psychotic disorders and identify the factors associated with employment.


Patients and methods
The study population comprised 406 patients with psychotic disorders who completed a forensic outpatient treatment order, were aged <65 years at discharge from a forensic psychiatric ward and provided written informed consent. Psychotic disorders were defined as psychiatric disorders classified into F2 in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition. Demographic data were collected from the medical records of the inpatient treatment period. Prognostic data during the outpatient treatment order period was provided by the reintegration coordinators responsible for coordinating the patients' social environment during this period. Exploratory univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses identified the factors associated with employment.


Results
The mean age at discharge was 44.4±10.8 years. The mean follow-up period was 2.69±1.01 years. There were 4.6 times more men (n=334) than women (n=72). During the outpatient treatment order period, 56 of 406 participants achieved employment (13.8%). Participants who committed serious crime, including homicide, arson, robbery, and sexual assault, had a lower employment rate compared to participants who committed bodily injury crimes (multivariable odds ratio, 0.421; 95% confidence interval, 0.220-0.807). History of substance use and living with family after discharge from a forensic psychiatric ward positively contributed to employment.


Conclusion
The employment rate among forensic psychiatric outpatients with psychotic disorders was low and was similar to that reported in previous studies on general psychiatric patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, serious criminal behavior negatively impacted employment.",Norio Sugawara;Yuji Yamada;Takako Nagata;Hiroko Kashiwagi;Toshiaki Kono;Naotsugu Hirabayashi;Takayuki Okada

This study results reveal that multivariate linear analysis, cord BaP-DNA adduct level was inversely associated with developmental quotient score in the adaptive domain [β = -0.08; 95% CI: (-0.16, -0.003); p = 0.04], gross motor domain [β = -0.10; 95% CI: (-0.20, -0.01); p = 0.02], fine motor domain [β = -0.15; 95% CI: (-0.25, -0.05); p = 0.01], language domain [β = -0.12; 95% CI: (-0.21, -0.03); p = 0.02], and personal-social domain [β = -0.13; 95% CI: (-0.22, -0.04); p<0.01]. Further, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed increased cord BaP-DNA adduct levels associated with increased odds of delayed in language domain.


Conclusion
In conclusion, the study suggested that prenatal PAH exposure monitored by umbilical cord blood BaP-DNA adducts may adversely affect the neurodevelopment of the infants at 12 months of age.",Yuehua Yang;Qian Zhang;Jing Cui;Abdul Rahaman;Xiao-Rong Huang;Ya Su;Ruqin Gao;Bingling Wang;Zulqarnain Baloch
345,Marge Kartau,"Cases of PML should be evaluated according to predisposing factors, as these subgroups differ by incidence rate, clinical course, and prognosis. The three most significant groups at risk of PML are patients with hematological malignancies mostly previously treated with immunotherapies but also untreated, patients with HIV infection, and patients using monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments. Epidemiological data is scarce and partly conflicting, but the distribution of the subgroups appears to have changed. While there is no specific anti-JCPyV treatment, restoration of the immune function is the most effective approach to PML treatment. Research is warranted to determine whether immune checkpoint inhibitors could benefit certain PML subgroups. There are no systematic national or international records of PML diagnoses or a risk stratification algorithm, except for MS patients receiving natalizumab (NTZ). These are needed to improve PML risk assessment and to tailor better prevention strategies.",Jussi Ot Sipilä;Eeva Auvinen;Maarit Palomäki;Auli Verkkoniemi-Ahola
346,Francesca Morgante,"Sialorrhoea is a frequent symptom of neurological diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, cerebral palsy, and stroke) and is defined as excessive saliva accumulation leading to unintentional loss of saliva from the mouth. Sialorrhoea increases the overall burden on the patient and their caregivers, the impact of which can be both physical and psychosocial. Treatments for sialorrhoea range from lifestyle and behavioural guidance, to medications, surgery or radiation. Nonpharmacological interventions include advice on posture, swallowing control, cough management, dietary changes, eating and drinking techniques, and behavioural modification; however, these conservative measures may be ineffective for people with progressive neurological conditions. The pharmacological treatment of sialorrhoea is challenging because medications licensed for this purpose are limited, but treatments can include anticholinergic drugs and botulinum toxins. Surgical treatment of sialorrhoea is typically reserved as a last resort for patients. IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) is the first botulinum toxin type A to receive US and UK marketing authorization for the symptomatic treatment of chronic sialorrhoea due to neurological disorders in adults. In this review, we discuss and compare the frequency and method of administration, location of treatment delivery, approximate annual costs and main side effects of botulinum toxin and different anticholinergic drugs. Management of patients with chronic neurological conditions requires input from multiple specialist teams and thus a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach is considered fundamental to ensure that care is consistent and tailored to patients' needs. To ensure that adult patients with neurological conditions receive the best care and sialorrhoea is well managed, we suggest a potential clinical care pathway for sialorrhoea with a MDT approach, which healthcare professionals could aspire to.",Ganesh Bavikatte;Fahim Anwar;Biju Mohamed

Postneurosurgical infection (PNSI) is a major problem. Linezolid is a bacteriostatic oxazolidinone antibiotic with a highly activity against Gram-positive cocci resistant to methicillin and a good cerebrospinal fluid penetration. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of linezolid in the treatment of PNSI caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS).


Methods
We conducted an observational study for all patients over 14 years old and diagnosed with MRS PNSI. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory information were collected prospectively.


Results
A total of 10 patients with PNSI (6 meningitis, 2 ventriculitis, and 2 subdural empyema) received linezolid. MRS isolated was Staphylococcus aureus in seven cases and Staphylococcus epidermidis in three cases. All isolated microorganisms were susceptible to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 2 mg/L) and linezolid (MIC = 1). The rate of microbiologic efficacy was 100% for patients with meningitis or ventriculitis. In the case of subdural empyema, focal infection had improved between 14 and 18 days. No adverse effects occurred during this study.


Conclusion
Our results suggest that linezolid as an alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of PNSI caused by MRS with a high rate of efficacy.",Nizar Fitouhi;Mohamed Aziz Daghmouri;Kamel Bahri

Granular cell tumors (GCTs) of the neurohypophysis are parasellar tumors arising from pituicytes in the neurohypophysis and are generally considered benign slow-growing tumors. We present a case of sellar GCT with aggressive features.


Case Description
A 70-year-old female presented with progressive vision impairment found to have bitemporal visual field defects. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 2.9 cm × 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm parasellar mass with extension into the third ventricle and causing optic tract edema (OTE). Right frontotemporal orbital craniotomy was performed and the tumor was partially removed to decompress optic nerves. Pathology identified the tumor as granular tumor of the sellar region. The patient's vision improved minimally after the surgery. Follow-up MRI after 3 months and 11 months showed stable left OTE.


Conclusion
GCTs were thought to be benign tumors with slow growth, but they could potentially possess aggressive features and invade into surrounding structures as described in this case. OTE can be a rare MRI finding of GCTs. Only one case of GCT-related OTE has been reported in literature to our best knowledge.",Matthew Hagen;Norberto Andaluz;Ruchi Bhabhra

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy often affects elderly and fragile patients who are not optimal candidates for major surgical procedures. Here, we report patients previously judged not suitable for cervical surgery, who were successfully treated with minimally invasive (MI) cervical decompressions without complications.


Methods
Retrospectively, we reviewed medically fragile patients (e.g., too many comorbidities), previously deemed unsuitable for surgery who successfully tolerated MI cervical decompressions. The accompanying preoperative comorbidities, surgical risks, complications, and neurological outcomes were assessed.


Results
Three male patients, with a mean age of 73 years, exhibited an average preoperative modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score of 8. The preoperative Charlson comorbidity indices, the Elixhauser comorbidity indices (respectively averaging 5.7 and 5.7 points, the preoperative Edmonton fragility index (average 12 points), and national surgical quality improvement program risks were calculated. Surgical times averaged 185 min and patients were followed for an average of 11.3 months. No patient had any immediate or delayed postoperative complications. The length of hospital stay was 1 day for each patient. The postoperative mJOA scores averaged 11, which was clinically significant. Further, the postoperative magnetic resonance imaging obtained approximately 3 months postoperative demonstrated adequate cord decompression.

Giant thrombosed vertebral artery aneurysms (GTVAs) are difficult disease to treat. Here, we are reporting a case of GTVA successfully treated with excluding the pathological segment and restoring the anterograde blood flow of the parent artery, highlighting the reliable surgical procedure.


Case Description
A 55-year-old man with a left GTVA complained of right hemiparesis (manual muscle testing 4/5) represented by hand clumsiness and gait disturbance, in addition to severe left-sided dysesthesia, was referred to our hospital. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) was incorporated into the GTVA segment, and the contralateral vertebral artery showed atherosclerotic change. Thus, we decided to treat the aneurysm with aneurysm trapping and thrombectomy, in conjunction with V3-radial artery graft (RAG)-V4 bypass and occipital artery (OA)-PICA bypass through a suboccipital transcondylar approach. The distal end of the dilated segment was meandering and deflecting outwardly to the vicinity of the internal auditory canal and was stretched in an axial direction. Thus, the V4 stump can be transposed to the triangle space made by the medulla, lower cranial nerves, and sigmoid sinus, and we could perform a safe and reliable anastomosis through the corridor. After the surgery, the compression of the brain stem was released, and right hemiparesis was improved completely after rehabilitation. The patient was discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score of 1.


Conclusion
Trapping of the aneurysm and thrombectomy are the most radical treatment for GTVA, and if possible, reconstruction of anterograde blood flow with V3-RAG-V4 bypass and OA-PICA bypass is desirable.",Tomohiro Inoue;Kazuaki Naemura;Atsuya Akabane

Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (EES) is the gold standard for pituitary adenoma (PA) resection. The sphenoid sinus (SS), a highly variable anatomic structure, is located in the center of the cranial base. It has previously been reported that poor pneumatization of the lateral recess of the SS (LRSS) increases the difficulty level of the surgery and the risk of neural and vascular injury. However, to date no studies have evaluated the association between LRSS volume and PAs removal rate by EES.


Methods
The present study analyzed 23 consecutive patients with new-onset PAs categorized as Knosp Grades 3 and 4 who underwent EES. A retrospective radiographic analysis was conducted on patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging and high-resolution computed tomography scans.


Results
Among PA cases categorized as Knosp 3 and 4, no significant association was found between the whole tumor's resection rate and LRSS volume (R = 0.08, P = 0.70). However, a significant association was found between cavernous sinus (CS) tumors' removal rate and LRSS volume (R = 0.52, P = 0.011). The same results were achieved in PAs with a Knosp Grade 4, with a stronger correlation (R = 0.60, P = 0.014).


Conclusion
The development of LRSS pneumatization affects the removal rate of CS tumors in PAs. Preoperative analysis of LRSS development should be considered when planning EES against PA with CS invasion.",Ryota Tamura;Taro Mase;Haruka Tamura;Masahiro Jinzaki;Kazunari Yoshida;Masahiro Toda

Following spine surgery, different types of inhalational anesthetic agents can result in postoperative delirium (POD) that can increase perioperative/postoperative morbidity. Here, we compared the incidence of POD in adults undergoing spine surgery anesthetized with isoflurane versus desflurane.


Methods
A prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial for patients undergoing spinal surgery was performed in 60 adults (aged 18-65 years); they were randomized to receive isoflurane or desflurane. On postoperative days 1 and 3, the diagnosis and severity of POD utilized 3D-Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM-severity delirium severity scores to assess patients' status. Multiple other variables which may have influenced the frequency/severity of POD were also studied.


Results
For the two groups, the incidence of POD utilizing isoflurane and desflurane was similar on postoperative days 1 (10% vs. 13.3%, P > 0.05) and 3 (6.6% vs. 0%, P > 0.05). The severity scores of POD for both anesthetic agents were also similar on postoperative days 1 (1.5 vs. 1) and 3 (0.5 vs. 0.5). In addition, there was no significant association of POD with other perioperative factors.

The choice of surgical approaches and options for the microsurgical vertebral artery (VA) and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms repair remains controversial.


Methods
A retrospective analysis of the clinical, surgical, and angiographic data of 80 patients with VA and PICA aneurysms treated from 2012 to 2018 was performed.


Results
The aneurysms were saccular in 50 cases (62.5%) and fusiform in 30 cases (37.5%). The median suboccipital craniotomy was the most common approach (73.8%). Retrosigmoid craniotomy was performed in 25% of patients. There were the following types of microsurgical operations: neck clipping (61.25%), clipping with the artery lumen formation (13.75%), trapping (10%), proximal clipping (5%), and deconstruction with anastomosis (10%). Fifty-seven (71.3%) patients were discharged without worsening of the clinical signs after surgery. The most common postoperative neurological disorder was palsy of IX and X cranial nerve revealed in 14 (17.5%) patients. No fatal outcomes or patients in vegetative state were identified. The complete occlusion of PICA and VA aneurysms according angiography was in 77 (96.3%) cases.


Conclusion
Microsurgical treatment is an effective method for VA and PICA aneurysms. The majority of VA and PICA aneurysms do not require complex basal approaches. A thorough preoperative planning, reconstructive clipping techniques, and anastomoses creation, as well as patient selection based on the established algorithms and consultations with endovascular surgeons, may reduce the number of complications and increase the rate of complete microsurgical occlusion in VA and PICA aneurysms.",Shalva Eliava;Dmitry Okishev;Elena Okisheva;Andronikos Spyrou

Cavernous sinus meningioma (CSM) causes gradual ophthalmoplegia and may eventually cause compression of the chiasma. The tumor is often histologically benign, slow growing, and seldom life threatening. Besides visual limitation, ophthalmoplegia causes emotional stress and disability. The tumor is commonly treated by operation, radiation, or both. While effective in varied degrees, the treatments, especially radical operation, are associated with unacceptable mortality and morbidity. The question remains as to what treatment approach is most conducive to longest survival with minimum disability.


Methods
In five patients, operation, radiotherapy, or both were based on presenting symptoms or delayed based on a doctor-patient decision, seeking the most desirable and suitable option that potentially offers longer life with less disability.


Results
Five patients were followed from over 2 to almost 5 decades: two patients are still alive, 25 and 28 years after craniotomy and radiation. One was treated conservatively for 15 years before requiring craniotomy and radiation. One was followed for 45 years without needing craniotomy or radiation, despite enlargement of the tumor. One was followed for 36 years after craniotomy. Patient did not have radiation. Craniotomy consisted of removing enough tumor to diminish symptoms without causing complications. There were no mortalities or complications.


Conclusion
The patient number is not large enough to make a broad conclusion. However, the individualized treatments and long follow-ups, together with detailed literature review, suggest that CSM requires individualized staged treatments based on each patient's condition. A period of ""wait and see"" before starting with either surgery or radiation treatment can benefit the patient.",

In Parkinson's disease (PD), the onset of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) is difficult to predict. This study examines whether dopamine transporter (DAT)-specific SPECT imaging in de novo PD relates to later development of LIDs.


Methods
42 de novo unilateral PD participants received DAT-specific SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT at time of diagnosis. At five years post-diagnosis, all PD patients were clinically evaluated and divided into two groups based on whether they had or had not developed LIDs. Fourteen gender- and age-matched healthy volunteers undertook 123I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging and were included as controls. A semi-quantification approach was used for the 123I-FP-CIT data using the occipital cortex as the reference region. We calculated specific binding ratios (SBR) for the caudate and putamen (posterior and anterior putaminal subregions). In parallel, we analysed our 123I-FP-CIT dataset with a voxel-based analysis approach.


Results
PD patients had significantly lower striatal 123I-FP-CIT SBR values in comparison to controls (p<0.001). After five years, dyskinetic patients (N=10) were taking higher daily doses of dopaminergic medication (p<0.001) and had more severe disease (difference in Hoehn & Yahr staging scores p<0.05) as compared to the non-dyskinetic group (N=32). At the time of diagnosis, 123I-FP-CIT SBR values were not statistically different between the two groups for all striatal regions (p>0.05). SPM voxel-based analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p>0.05).


Conclusion
123I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging, performed at diagnosis in de novo early-stage PD could not differentiate patients who will develop LIDs within five years from those who will not.",Marta Gennaro;Nicholas P Lao-Kaim;David Towey;Paola Piccini

Up to now, only a few genes/loci have been identified, but these genes have not been replicated in other essential tremor families or cohorts. Here we report a genetic study in a cohort of 197 Chinese pedigrees clinically diagnosed with essential tremor. Using a comprehensive strategy combining linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, long-read whole-genome sequencing, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and GC-rich polymerase chain reaction, we identified an abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5' region of the NOTCH2NLC gene that co-segregated with disease in 11 essential tremor families (5.58%) from our cohort. Clinically, probands that had an abnormal GGC repeat expansion were found to have more severe tremor phenotypes, lower activities of daily living ability. Obvious genetic anticipation was also detected in these 11 essential tremor-positive families.

362,Allison M Martin,"To evaluate a potential relationship between BRAF V600E mutation and PD-L1 expression, we examined the expression of PD-L1 in pediatric high- and low-grade glioma cell lines as well as a cohort of pediatric low-grade glioma patient samples. Half of the tumors in our patient cohort were V600-wildtype and half were V600E mutant. All tumors expressed PD-L1. In most tumors, PD-L1 expression was low (<5%), but in some cases over 50% of cells were positive. Extent of PD-L1 expression and immune cell infiltration was independent of BRAF V600E mutational status. All cell lines evaluated, including a BRAF V600E mutant xenograft, expressed PD-L1. Transient transfection of cell lines with a plasmid expressing mutant BRAF V600E had minimal effect on PD-L1 expression. These findings suggest that the PD-1 pathway is active in subsets of pediatric low-grade glioma as a mechanism of immune evasion independent of BRAF V600E mutational status. Low-grade gliomas that are unresectable and refractory to traditional therapy are associated with significant morbidity and continue to pose a treatment challenge. PD-1 pathway inhibitors may offer an alternative treatment approach. Clinical trials will be critical in determining whether PD-L1 expression indicates likely therapeutic benefit with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",W Robert Bell;Ming Yuan;Lauren Harris;Bradley Poore;Antje Arnold;Elizabeth L Engle;Laura Asnaghi;Michael Lim;Eric H Raabe;Charles G Eberhart
363,Antoine Yrondi,"INTRODUCTION
Antidepressant drugs are effective therapies for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD); however, they are frequently associated with side effects. Although there is some evidence for a relationship between genetic variation and side effects, little is known regarding the role of dynamic molecular factors as moderators of side effect. The aim of this study is to assess microRNA (miRNA) changes associated with side effects during escitalopram treatment, and their downstream effects on target gene expression.


METHODS
160 patients with MDD from the CAN-BIND -1 cohort were included. Side effects were assessed with the Toronto Side Effect Scale after 2 weeks of treatment with escitalopram. We assessed the relationship between side effects and changes in peripheral expression of miRNAs between baseline and week 2. For miRNAs whose expression changed, we used target prediction algorithms to identify putative messenger RNA (mRNA) targets and assessed their expression.


RESULTS
Nausea was experienced by 42.5% of patients. We identified 45 miRNAs whose expression changed upon initiation of escitalopram treatment, of which 10 displayed a negative association with intensity of nausea (miR15b-5p, miR17-5p, miR20a-5p, miR20b-5p, miR103a-3p, miR103b, miR106a-5p, miR182-5p, miR185-5p and miR660-5p). Additionally, we found negative associations between 4 miRNAs (miR20a-5p, miR106a-5p, miR185-5p, miR660-5p) and mRNA targets. The expression of the miR185-5p target, CAMK2δ was significantly decreased [log 2 mean= -0.048 (0.233)] between weeks 0 and 2 (p=0.01)].


CONCLUSIONS
We identified an overexpression of miR185-5p during escitalopram treatment of MDD, which was negatively associated with intensity of nausea, and identified a potential mRNA target which may mediate this effect.",Laura M Fiori;Benicio N Frey;Raymond W Lam;Glenda M MacQueen;Roumen Milev;Daniel J Müller;Jane A Foster;Sidney H Kennedy;Gustavo Turecki
364,Matthew J McGirt,"BACKGROUND
In an effort to improve efficiency of care, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) have emerged as lower-cost options. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is one of the most prevalent spine surgeries performed and rarely requires overnight stays in the hospital, supporting its migration to the ASC. Recent analyses have called into question the safety of outpatient ACDF, potentially slowing its adoption. ASC-ACDF studies have largely been limited to small series, precluding an accurate assessment of safety.


OBJECTIVE
To analyze 2000 ASC-ACDF cases, describe patient selection and perioperative protocol, and report associated safety profile.


METHODS
A total of 2000 patients who underwent 1 to 3 level ACDF in a single ASC from 2006 to 2018 were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients were observed in a 4-h postanesthesia care unit (PACU) with a multimodal pain management regiment. Data were collected on patient demographics, comorbidities, operative details, and 30- and 90-d morbidity.


RESULTS
Of the 2000 patients, 10 (0.5%) required transfer to an inpatient setting within the 4-h observation. Reasons for transfer included hematoma (2), pain control (2), cerebrospinal fluid leak (1), and medical complications (5). Six patients (0.3%) underwent reoperation within 30 d. All-cause 30-d readmission was 1.9%.


CONCLUSION
An analysis of 2000 ACDF patients in an ASC setting with a standardized perioperative protocol demonstrates that surgical complications occur at a low rate (<1%) and can be appropriately diagnosed and managed in a 4-h PACU. In an effort to decrease healthcare costs, surgeons can safely perform ACDFs in an ASC utilizing patient selection criteria and perioperative management protocols similar to those reported here.",Vincent Rossi;David Peters;Hunter Dyer;Domagoj Coric;Anthony L Asher;Deborah Pfortmiller;Tim Adamson

366,Chae Jung Park,"PURPOSE
To evaluate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) radiomics with machine learning improves the prediction of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status of lower-grade gliomas beyond radiomic features from conventional MRI and DTI histogram parameters.


METHODS
A total of 168 patients with pathologically confirmed lower-grade gliomas were retrospectively enrolled. A total of 158 and 253 radiomic features were extracted from DTI (DTI radiomics) and conventional MRI (T1-weighted image with contrast enhancement, T2-weighted image, and FLAIR [conventional radiomics]), respectively. The random forest models for predicting IDH status were trained with variable combinations as follows: (1) DTI radiomics, (2) conventional radiomics, (3) conventional radiomics + DTI radiomics, and (4) conventional radiomics + DTI histogram. The models were validated with nested cross-validation. The predictive performances of those models were compared by using area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operating characteristic analysis, and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated.


RESULTS
Adding DTI radiomics to conventional radiomics significantly improved the accuracy of IDH status subtyping (AUC, 0.900 [95% CI, 0.855-0.945], p = 0.006), whereas adding DTI histogram parameters yielded nonsignificant trend toward improvement (0.869 [95% CI, 0.816-0.922], p = 0.150) compared with the model with conventional radiomics alone (0.835 [95% CI, 0.773-0.896]). The performance of the model consisting of both DTI and conventional radiomics was significantly superior than that of model consisting of both DTI histogram parameters and conventional radiomics (0.900 vs 0.869, p = 0.040).


CONCLUSION
DTI radiomics with machine learning can help improve the subtyping of IDH status beyond conventional radiomics and DTI histogram parameters in patients with lower-grade gliomas.",Yoon Seong Choi;Yae Won Park;Sung Soo Ahn;Seok-Gu Kang;Jong-Hee Chang;Se Hoon Kim;Seung-Koo Lee
367,Eduardo Joaquim Lopes Alho,"PURPOSE
The current assessment of patients with craniofacial asymmetries is accomplished by physical examination, anamnesis and radiological imaging. We propose a semi-automated, computer-assisted craniofacial evaluation (SymMetric v 1.0) based on orthogonal photography of the patient's head in 3 positions. The system is simple, low-cost, no-radiation or special resources needed. Although it does not substitute CT in cases of doubt between craniosynostosis and positional plagiocephaly, multiple numeric evaluations indicate regional deformities and severity of the asymmetry, which can help in the clinical decision of indicating or not the orthosis in positional deformities, determining treatment duration or evaluating surgical outcomes after correction.


METHODS
A Matlab-based tool was developed for digital processing of photographs taken in 3 positions (anterior, superior and lateral). The software guides the user to select visible and reproducible landmarks in each photograph acquisition and calculates multiple indexes and metrics, generating a set of comprehensive plots to offer the user an overview of head and facial symmetry across the orthogonal views. For purposes of demonstration, we evaluated 2 patients (one control and one with non-sinostotic deformity).


RESULTS
The results show a clear differentiation of the control and plagiocephalic patient metrics mainly in the superior view, showing potential for diagnosis of the condition, and also detected the clinical improvement during helmet treatment in the follow-up, 3 and 5 months after orthosis' use.


CONCLUSION

We sought to define the clinical and molecular spectra of PB to inform new treatment approaches for this orphan cancer. Tumor, blood, and clinical data from 91 patients with PB or supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (sPNETs/CNS-PNETs), and 2 pineal parenchymal tumors of intermediate differentiation (PPTIDs) were collected from 29 centres in the Rare Brain Tumor Consortium. We used global DNA methylation profiling to define a core group of PB from 72/93 cases, which were delineated into five molecular sub-groups. Copy number, whole exome and targeted sequencing, and miRNA expression analyses were used to evaluate the clinico-pathologic significance of each sub-group. Tumors designated as group 1 and 2 almost exclusively exhibited deleterious homozygous loss-of-function alterations in miRNA biogenesis genes (DICER1, DROSHA, and DGCR8) in 62 and 100% of group 1 and 2 tumors, respectively. Recurrent alterations of the oncogenic MYC-miR-17/92-RB1 pathway were observed in the RB and MYC sub-group, respectively, characterized by RB1 loss with gain of miR-17/92, and recurrent gain or amplification of MYC. PB sub-groups exhibited distinct clinical features: group 1-3 arose in older children (median ages 5.2-14.0 years) and had intermediate to excellent survival (5-year OS of 68.0-100%), while Group RB and MYC PB patients were much younger (median age 1.3-1.4 years) with dismal survival (5-year OS 37.5% and 28.6%, respectively). We identified age < 3 years at diagnosis, metastatic disease, omission of upfront radiation, and chr 16q loss as significant negative prognostic factors across all PBs. Our findings demonstrate that PB exhibits substantial molecular heterogeneity with sub-group-associated clinical phenotypes and survival.

369,Elena Perenthaler,"Developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of devastating genetic disorders, resulting in early-onset, therapy-resistant seizures and developmental delay. Here we report on 22 individuals from 15 families presenting with a severe form of intractable epilepsy, severe developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, visual disturbance and similar minor dysmorphisms. Whole exome sequencing identified a recurrent, homozygous variant (chr2:64083454A > G) in the essential UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP2) gene in all probands. This rare variant results in a tolerable Met12Val missense change of the longer UGP2 protein isoform but causes a disruption of the start codon of the shorter isoform, which is predominant in brain. We show that the absence of the shorter isoform leads to a reduction of functional UGP2 enzyme in neural stem cells, leading to altered glycogen metabolism, upregulated unfolded protein response and premature neuronal differentiation, as modeled during pluripotent stem cell differentiation in vitro. In contrast, the complete lack of all UGP2 isoforms leads to differentiation defects in multiple lineages in human cells. Reduced expression of Ugp2a/Ugp2b in vivo in zebrafish mimics visual disturbance and mutant animals show a behavioral phenotype. Our study identifies a recurrent start codon mutation in UGP2 as a cause of a novel autosomal recessive DEE syndrome. Importantly, it also shows that isoform-specific start-loss mutations causing expression loss of a tissue-relevant isoform of an essential protein can cause a genetic disease, even when an organism-wide protein absence is incompatible with life.

370,Rafael Martinez-Perez,"Minipterional (MPT) craniotomy has recently been added to the neurosurgical armamentarium as a less invasive alternative to the pterional craniotomy for the treatment of parasellar lesions. However, its clinical applicability in the treatment of certain complex aneurysms, such as those arising in the paraclinoid region, remains unclear. To illustrate the microsurgical anatomy of a modified extradural MPT approach, which combines a classic MPT craniotomy with an extradural anterior clinoidectomy, and to demonstrate its clinical applicability in the treatment of complex paraclinoid aneurysms. A stepwise extradural MPT approach is illustrated in a cadaver study. Clinical outcome data from a series of 19 patients with 20 paraclinoid aneurysms treated surgically using the extradural MPT approach between 2016 and 2018 were retrospectively collected. In 95% of the cases, complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved. No aneurysm recurrences were seen during follow-up with a median length of 21 months. The outcome, according to the modified Rankin Scale, was 0 points in 12 patients (63%), 1 point in 6 patients (32%), and 2 points in 1 patient (5%). Four out of 6 patients (67%) with initial visual symptoms showed improvement following treatment, whereas in two (11%), vision became worse. The extradural MPT approach ensures a sufficiently large exposure of the paraclinoid region that is comparable with conventional approaches with the advantage of being minimally invasive. Our case series demonstrates the feasibility of this approach for the treatment of complex paraclinoid aneurysms.",Holger Joswig;Asterios Tsimpas;Tomas Poblete;Pablo Albiña;Ivan Perales;Jorge M Mura

Spinal percutaneous biportal endoscopic surgery (PBES) is a minimally invasive surgery; however, it is associated with several poor outcomes. This study aimed to analyze unsuccessful PBES outcomes and verify their relationships with patient satisfaction.


METHODS
From May 2015 to June 2018, PBES was performed at several institutions. Unsuccessful outcomes (reoperation and prolonged hospital stay) due to various reasons (hematoma, lesion recurrence, incomplete decompression, dural tear, instability, ascites, and infection) were analyzed. To verify the relationships between surgical experience and unsuccessful outcomes, the first 50 cases and the later cases were compared. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationships between unsuccessful outcomes and patient dissatisfaction.


RESULTS
Among 866 patients, 797 cases with 1-year follow-up and complete data were analyzed. In total, 82 patients with unsuccessful outcomes were identified (10.29%). The incidences of hematoma (p < 0.04), incomplete operation (p < 0.01), and dural tear (p < 0.01) were significantly higher in the first 50 cases than in the later cases. Analyses of the relationship between unsuccessful outcomes and patient dissatisfaction showed that incomplete decompression (odds ratio (OR) 4.06), postoperative instability (OR 3.64), hematoma (OR 3.25), ascite (OR 3.25), dural tear (OR 3.02), and local recurrence (OR 2.45, 95%) contributed significantly.


CONCLUSIONS
Unsuccessful PBES outcomes were mostly associated with hematomas, incomplete decompression, and dural tears; instability, ascites, and infection contributed to a lesser extent. Incomplete decompression, instability, hematoma, ascite, dural tear, and local recurrence were significantly related to patient dissatisfaction. The potential for poor outcomes should be described to the patient and considered prior to surgery.",Seung-Kook Kim;Sang-Soo Kang;Hyun-Jin Park;Sangho Han;Su-Chan Lee
372,Gaifen Li,"Depression, plus the accompanying memory impairment, is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Thus, there is a critical need to develop new drugs based on distinct strategies. FG-4592, an inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase, activates the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway, to produce multiple effects on cell properties. Here, we examined whether FG-4592 has antidepressant effects, using a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) procedure to establish rodent depression models. We found that FG-4592 not only reversed depressive behaviors but also improved CUMS-induced memory impairment. Mechanistically, FG-4592 could play an important role in promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. At the molecular level, FG-4592 was found to activate HIF-1 and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein/brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways in vivo, as well as promote the expression of postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, PSD95 and Homer1. An examination of primary hippocampal neurons showed that FG-4592 promoted dendritic growth. Taken together, our results not only provide an experimental basis for the future application of FG-4592 in clinical treatment of depression but also support the argument that the HIF-1 signaling pathway is a promising target for the treatment of depression.",Ming Zhao;Xiang Cheng;Tong Zhao;Zhenlong Feng;Yongqi Zhao;Ming Fan;Lingling Zhu

A total of 120 patients were originally randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive dalfampridine 10 mg or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Here, we sought to explore the effect of dalfampridine on static balance in single-task and dual-task conditions in a subgroup of 41 patients. They underwent static posturography in quiet standing (single-task) and while performing the Stroop test (dual-task) at randomization (baseline), after 12 weeks and after a 4-week wash-out period. Baseline characteristics of active group (n = 27) did not differ from those of placebo group (n = 14). Dalfampridine treatment was associated with better balance control than placebo in both single-task (F = 4.80, p = 0.034) and dual-task (F = 6.42, p = 0.015) conditions, with small-to-moderate effect sizes (Cohen's f2 = 0.122-0.162). The beneficial effect of dalfampridine was not retained 4 weeks after its discontinuation. The rate of accidental falls per month did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.12). Our preliminary findings suggest that dalfampridine can be considered a potential option to treat balance impairment due to MS. Larger sample sizes are needed to verify if the beneficial effect of dalfampridine on balance can be translated into a reduced risk of accidental falls.",Letizia Castelli;Laura De Giglio;Valeria Bonanno;Claudio Gasperini;Carlo Pozzilli

Herein, we studied histopathological and molecular changes in brain lesions of the Eker rat model carrying germline mutation of the tsc2 gene, predisposed to multiple neoplasias. Predominant subcortical tumors were analyzed, along with a rare form occurring within the pyriform lobe. The uniform composition of lesions supports the histochemical parity of malformations, with immunofluorescence data supporting their neuro-glial origin. Massive depletion of mature neurons and axonal loss were evident within lesions, with occasional necrotic foci implying advanced stage of pathology. Enrichment of mesenchymal-derived cell markers with hallmarks of neurogenesis and active microglia imply enhanced cell proliferation, with local immune response. The depletion of capillaries within the core was complemented by the formation of dense mesh of nascent vessels at the interface of neoplasia with healthy tissue, implying large-scale vascular remodeling.

Treatment-seeking volunteers with MA use disorder were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of IBUD 50 mg twice daily (N = 64) or placebo (N = 61) with medication management counseling. Participants visited the outpatient research clinic twice weekly to provide urine specimens for drug screens and undergo study assessments. The primary outcome was end of treatment MA-abstinence (EOTA) during weeks 11 and 12 of treatment. Serum IBUID levels were measured for IBUD participants during week 3 of treatment. There was no difference in EOTA for IBUD (14%) versus placebo (16%, p > 0.05). There was no correlation between serum IBUD levels and MA use during treatment and mean IBUD levels for participants with (mean = 51.3, SD = 20.3) and without (mean = 54.7, SD = 33.0, p = 0.70) EOTA. IBUD was well tolerated. IBUD did not facilitate MA abstinence in this outpatient trial.

Acute hydrocephalus is a common complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH); however, attempts to predict shunt-dependent chronic hydrocephalus using clinical parameters have been equivocal.


METHODS
Cohort study of aSAH is treated with external ventricular drainage (EVD) placement at our institution, 2001-2016, via logistic regression. EVD-related parameters included mean/total EVD output (days 0-2), EVD days, EVD days ≤ 5 mmHg, and wean/clamp fails. aSAH outcomes assessed included ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement, delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), radiographic infarction (RI), symptomatic vasospasm (SV), age, and aSAH grades.


RESULTS
Two hundred and ten aSAH patients underwent EVD treatment for a median 12 days (range 1-54); 85 required VPS (40%). On univariate analysis, EVD output, total EVD days, EVD days ≤ 5 mmHg, and wean/clamp trial failures were significantly associated with VPS placement (p < 0.01 for all parameters). No EVD output parameter demonstrated a significant association with DCI, RI, or SV. On multivariate analysis, EVD output was a significant predictor of VPS placement, after adjusting for age and clinical and radiological grades; the optimal threshold for predicting VPS placement was mean daily output > 204 ml on days 0-2 (OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.31-5.07). Multiple wean failures were associated with unfavorable functional outcome, after adjusting for age, grade, and VPS placement (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.10-2.47). We developed a score incorporating age, grade and EVD parameters (MAGE) for predicting VPS placement after aSAH.


CONCLUSIONS
EVD output parameters and wean/clamp trial failures predicted shunt dependence in an age- and grade-adjusted multivariable model. Early VPS placement may be warranted in patients with MAGE score ≥ 4, particularly following 2 failed wean trials.",C S Graffeo;G Kleinstern;L P Carlstrom;M J Link;A A Rabinstein
377,Sheena Khan,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Stroke patients are currently monitored for neurological deterioration for 24 h following treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy. This requires low nursing ratios and an intensive-care-like setting. As the half-life of IV tPA is short, many patients may not require such prolonged intensive monitoring and could be downgraded much earlier. We evaluate the frequency of neurological deterioration in the 0-12 and 12-24 h post-treatment windows.


METHODS
Patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke treated with IV tPA and/or thrombectomy at our institution from 2016-2018 were prospectively followed per protocol for 24 h post-therapy (examinations every 15 min for 2 h, every 30 min for 6 h, and hourly thereafter). Neurological deteriorations were recorded along with interventions and complications. Frequency of deterioration within the 0-12 and 12-24 h post-treatment windows was determined, along with factors associated with decline at each time point.


RESULTS
A total of 172 patients were treated (IV:135, IA:65, both:30). Thirty-six (21%) experienced a documented neurologic deterioration [8 due to intracerebral hemorrhage (4.7%)]. Five patients deteriorated in the 12-24 h window; all but one had experienced earlier examination changes. Elevated NIHSS was associated with a higher likelihood of deterioration overall. Early fluctuation was associated with decline after 12 h.


CONCLUSIONS
New onset of neurologic deterioration is rare 12-24 h after treatment of acute stroke. Stable patients with low NIHSS scores and no ICU needs may not require intensive monitoring greater than 12 h post-treatment.",Alexandria Soto;Elisabeth B Marsh

Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG expansion greater than 35 in the IT-15 gene. There is an inverse correlation between the number of pathological CAG and the age of onset. However, CAG repeats between 40 and 42 showed a wider onset variation. We aimed to investigate potential clinical differences between patients with age at onset ≥ 60 years (late onset-HD) and patients with age at onset between 30 and 59 years (common-onset HD) in a cohort of patients with the same CAG expansions (40-42).


METHODS
A retrospective analysis of 66 HD patients with 40-41-42 CAG expansion was performed. Patients were investigated with the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (subitems I-II-III and Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment and Stage of Disease). Data were analysed using χ2, Fisher's test, t test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. GENMOD analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to study the disease progression.


RESULTS
The age of onset ranged from 39 to 59 years in the CO subgroup, whereas the LO subgroup showed an age of onset from 60 to 73 years. No family history was reported in 31% of the late-onset in comparison with 20% in common-onset HD (p = 0.04). No difference emerged in symptoms of onset, in clinical manifestations and in progression of disease between the two groups.


CONCLUSION
There were no clinical differences between CO and LO subgroups with 40-42 CAG expansion. There is a need of further studies on environmental as well genetic variables modifying the age at onset.",Luca Romano;Paola Rebora;Lorenzo Nanetti;Anna Castaldo;Cinzia Gellera;Caterina Mariotti;Antonella Macerollo;M Giuliana Cislaghi

380,Luigi Trojano,"The concept and the term of constructional apraxia have been proposed by Karl Kleist and described in his impressive book ""Gehirnpathologie"", published in 1934. However, the first ever paper under the heading of constructional apraxia was written by Hans Strauss, one of Kleist's pupils, and published in 1924. Nowadays, the term constructional apraxia is still in use to refer to all disorders observed in drawing and assembling activities; its assessment, performed as it was in early studies, is part of common practice in behavioral neurology and neuropsychology. Nonetheless, the concept and the neural underpinnings of constructional apraxia have been deeply revisited with respect to the original proposal. Modern studies demonstrated that drawing and assembling are based on very large and complex brain networks extending in both hemispheres, including the left angular gyrus (as hypothesized by Kleist) but well beyond the original ideas about localization of constructional apraxia. From a clinical point of view, constructional apraxia has poor localizing value but provides valuable diagnostic information for conditions of cognitive impairment.",
381,Peng Huang,"Pediatric medulloblastoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. However, few studies have reported gene expression profiles of pediatric medulloblastoma and the molecular mechanism underlying this disease is unclear. To identify essential genes in pediatric medulloblastoma, we analyzed three microarray data sets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We identified 1798 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the limma package. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that ""entrainment of circadian clock by photoperiod,"" ""regulation of triglyceride biosynthetic process,"" and ""snare complex"" pathway were significantly enriched gene sets that correlated with pediatric medulloblastoma. Enriched Gene Ontology annotations of DEGs mostly included ""ion-gated channel activity,"" ""gated channel activity,"" and ""channel activity."" Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched in ""glutamatergic synapse,"" ""synaptic vesicle cycle,"" and ""GABAergic synapse."" Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis showed that RAB5C, VAMP2, AP2M1, FNBP1, AP2A1, SYT1, SYNJ2, SYT2, HIP1R, UBB, WNT5A, SH3GL2, SYNJ1, EPN1, and DNM1 were hub genes.

382,E V Novosadova,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative pathology resulting from the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) and their receptors are key regulators of the survival, differentiation, and development of neurons. However, the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of PD is still unclear. Here, we analyzed the expression of NTFs and their receptors in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from the fibroblasts of patients with PD and healthy donors (HDs). Four PD-derived iPSC lines with different mutations and three cell lines from HDs at different stages of neuronal differentiation were used for RT-qPCR analysis and ELISA. We found that the mRNA levels of most analyzed genes were altered in PD-derived cells compared with those in HD-derived cells at all stages. Importantly, irrespective of PD-associated mutations, the mRNA levels of the BDNF and GDNF genes were mostly increased or unchanged in predominantly DA terminally differentiated neurons (TDNs) compared with those in HD-derived cells. Strikingly, in contrast to BDNF and GDNF mRNA levels, BDNF and GDNF protein levels were lower in almost all PD-derived TDNs than in HD-derived cells, thus indicating the dysregulation of NTF expression at the post-transcriptional level. We suggest that this dysregulation is one of the important signs of PD development.",V V Nenasheva;I V Makarova;O V Dolotov;L S Inozemtseva;E L Arsenyeva;S V Chernyshenko;R I Sultanov;S N Illarioshkin;I A Grivennikov;V Z Tarantul
383,I Namdar,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered to be the leading cause of disability and death among young people. Up to 30% of mTBI patients report motor impairments, such as altered coordination and impaired balance and gait. The objective of the present study was to characterize motor performance and motor learning changes, in order to achieve a more thorough understanding of the possible motor consequences of mTBI in humans. Mice were exposed to traumatic brain injury using the weight-drop model and subsequently subjected to a battery of behavioral motor tests. Immunohistochemistry was conducted in order to evaluate neuronal survival and synaptic connectivity. TBI mice showed a different walking pattern on the Erasmus ladder task, without any significant impairment in motor performance and motor learning. In the running wheels, mTBI mice showed reduced activity during the second dark phase and increased activity during the second light phase compared to the control mice. There was no difference in the sum of wheel revolutions throughout the experiment. On the Cat-Walk paradigm, the mice showed a wider frontal base of support post mTBI. The same mice spent a significantly greater percent of time standing on three paws post mTBI compared with controls. mTBI mice also showed a decrease in the number of neurons in the temporal cortex compared with the control group. In summary, mTBI mice suffered from mild motor impairments, minor changes in the circadian clock, and neuronal damage.

384,Kanchan Vats,"Studies from our lab demonstrated that 1 × 105 intra-arterial mesenchymal stem cells (IA MSCs) at 6 h following ischemic stroke are efficacious owing to its maximum homing due to elevated stromal derived factor 1 (SDF1) in the tissue. Further, IA MSCs could abate the infarct progression, improve functional outcome, and decrease expression of calcineurin by modifying neuronal Ca2+ channels following ischemic stroke. Since stroke pathology also encompasses acidosis that worsens the condition; hence, the role of acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) in this context could not be overlooked. ASIC1a being the major contributor towards acidosis triggers Ca2+ ions overload which progressively contributes towards exacerbation of neuronal injury following ischemic insult. Inflammasome involvement in ischemic stroke is well reported as activated ASIC1a increases the expression of inflammasome in a pH-dependent manner to trigger inflammatory cascade. Hence, the current study aimed to identify if IA MSCs can decrease the production of inflammasome by attenuating ASIC1a expression to render neuroprotection. Ovariectomized Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 90 min were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 1 × 105 MSCs IA at 6 h to check for the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasome in different groups. Inhibition studies were carried out to explore the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrate that IA MSCs improves functional outcome and oxidative stress parameters, and decreases the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasomes in the cortical brain region after ischemic stroke. This study offers a preliminary evidence of the role of IA MSCs in regulating inflammasome by modulating ASIC1a.",Deepaneeta Sarmah;Aishika Datta;Jackson Saraf;Harpreet Kaur;Kanta Pravalika;Madhuri Wanve;Kiran Kalia;Anupom Borah;Kunjan R Dave;Dileep R Yavagal;Pallab Bhattacharya

Previous work found that traditional cognitive behavioral therapy approaches do not impact the ERN. However, none of these approaches directly target the psychological constructs linked to an increased ERN (e.g., error sensitivity). In the current study, we examine the extent to which a brief, computerized intervention (""Treating the ERN""; i.e., TERN) might impact the ERN by reducing error sensitivity. Results suggest that TERN reduced the ERN and that the impact of the intervention was larger amongst individuals with an increased baseline ERN.

We tested the hypothesis that Acomys would have molecular and immunohistochemical evidence of reduced spinal inflammation and fibrosis following SCI as compared to C57BL/6 mice (Mus), which similar to all mammals studied to date exhibits spinal scarring following SCI. Initial experiments used two pathway-focused RT-PCR gene arrays (""wound healing"" and ""neurogenesis"") to evaluate tissue samples from the C2-C6 spinal cord 3-days after a C3/C4 hemi-crush injury (C3Hc). Based on the gene array results, specific genes were selected for RT-qPCR evaluation using species-specific primers. The results supported our hypothesis by showing increased inflammation and fibrosis related gene expression (Serpine 1, Plau, Timp1) in Mus as compared to Acomys (P<0.05). RT-qPCR also showed enhanced stem cell and axonal guidance related gene expression (Bmp2, GDNF, Shh) in Acomys compared to Mus (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical evaluation of the spinal lesion at 4-wks post-injury indicated reduced collagen IV immunostaining in Acomys (P<0.05). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1(IBA1) immunostaining indicated morphological differences in the appearance of astrocytes and macrophages/microglia in Acomys.

It is indispensable for action-outcome-driven (goal-directed) behavior, consolidating action-outcome relationships and linking contextual information with instrumental behavior. In this brief review, we will discuss the growing list of molecular factors involved in PL function. Ventral to the PL is the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). We will also summarize emerging evidence from rodents (complementing existing literature describing humans) that it too is involved in action-outcome conditioning. We describe experiments using procedures that quantify responding based on reward value, the likelihood of reinforcement, or effort requirements, touching also on experiments assessing food consumption more generally. We synthesize these findings with the argument that the mOFC is essential to goal-directed action when outcome value information is not immediately observable and must be recalled and inferred.",Michelle K Sequeira;Britton R Barbee;Shannon L Gourley
388,Yue Ding,"Over the past decade, many studies have focused on clarifying the roles of different N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits in cerebral ischemia, hoping to develop subunit-selective drugs. Recently, more attention was given to studying the role of GluN2C in ischemia damage, which may lead to the development of new NMDA receptor antagonists for cerebral ischemia. Results showed that GluN2C inhibition or knockout can effectively alleviate the ischemic injury caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion and, contrarily, can aggravate the damage to hippocampal CA1 circuit caused by transient global cerebral ischemia. These results indicate the complicated roles of GluN2C in cerebral ischemia. In this minireview, we focus on these findings, describe the roles of GluN2C from different cell origins in ischemic damage, and explain the above inconsistent experimental results.",Le Wang;Yuexiang Huo;Yanping Sun;Long Wang;Zibin Gao;Yongjun Sun
389,Robert J Shulman,"BACKGROUND
Gut permeability is increased in some children and adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We investigated whether this also is true for children with functional abdominal pain (FAP). We also determined whether sex affected permeability results.


METHODS
Sucrose, lactulose, mannitol, and sucralose were ingested after an overnight fast in well-phenotyped children with IBS (n = 95), FAP (n = 25), and healthy controls (HC) (n = 60). Urine was collected for 24 hours. Percent sucrose recovery was calculated based on the 0- to 3-hour collection; lactulose/mannitol ratio both on the 0- to 3-hour and 0- to 24-hour collections; and percent sucralose recovery on the 0- to 24-hours collection.


KEY RESULTS
Age was similar among the groups (P = .26). The lactulose/mannitol ratio was increased in IBS compared with HC at 0-3 and 0-24 hours (P = .023, P = .05, respectively). Percent sucralose recovery was greater in FAP than in HC (P = .045). No differences were noted among the groups in percent sucrose recovery. Taking sex into account, percent sucrose recovery was greater in girls with IBS vs HC girls (P = .008). The lactulose/mannitol ratio was greater in boys with IBS compared with HC boys at both time points (both P = .02). Percent sucralose recovery was greater in boys with IBS than in FAP or HC (both P < .001).


CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES
Sex is a critically important factor when measuring gut permeability. Boys with IBS have increased lactulose/mannitol ratios and percent sucralose recovery. Girls with IBS have increased percent recovery of sucrose. Children with FAP do not demonstrate abnormal gut 0permeability even taking sex into account.",Sridevi Devaraj;Margaret Heitkemper
390,Thomas R Barber,"OBJECTIVES
Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) patients have a high risk of developing a Parkinsonian disorder, offering an opportunity for neuroprotective intervention. Predicting near-term conversion, however, remains a challenge. Dopamine transporter imaging, while informative, is expensive and not widely available. Here, we investigate the utility of susceptibility-weighted MRI (SWI) to detect abnormalities of the substantia nigra in RBD, and explore their association with striatal dopaminergic deficits.


METHODS
SWI of the substantia nigra was performed in 46 RBD patients, 27 Parkinson's patients, and 32 control subjects. Dorsal nigral hyperintensity (DNH) was scored by two blinded raters, and separately quantified using a semiautomated process. Forty-two RBD patients were also imaged with 123 I-ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography (DaT SPECT/CT).


RESULTS
Consensus visual DNH classification was possible in 87% of participants. 27.5% of RBD patients had lost DNH, compared with 7.7% of control subjects and 96% of Parkinson's patients. RBD patients lacking DNH had significantly lower putamen dopaminergic SPECT/CT activity compared to RBD patients with DNH present (specific uptake ratios 1.89 vs. 2.33, P = 0.002). The mean quantified DNH signal intensity declined in a stepwise pattern, with RBD patients having lower intensity than controls (0.837 vs. 0.877, P = 0.01) but higher than PD patients (0.837 vs. 0.765, P < 0.001).


INTERPRETATION
Over one quarter of RBD patients have abnormal substantia nigra SWI reminiscent of Parkinson's, which is associated with a greater dopaminergic deficit. This modality may help enrich neuroprotective trials with early converters.",Ludovica Griffanti;Kevin M Bradley;Daniel R McGowan;Christine Lo;Clare E Mackay;Michele T Hu;Johannes C Klein
391,Peter Kok,"Recent work suggests that a key function of the hippocampus is to predict the future. This is thought to depend on its ability to bind inputs over time and space and to retrieve upcoming or missing inputs based on partial cues. In line with this, previous research has revealed prediction-related signals in the hippocampus for complex visual objects, such as fractals and abstract shapes. Implicit in such accounts is that these computations in the hippocampus reflect domain-general processes that apply across different types and modalities of stimuli. An alternative is that the hippocampus plays a more domain-specific role in predictive processing, with the type of stimuli being predicted determining its involvement. To investigate this, we compared hippocampal responses to auditory cues predicting abstract shapes (Experiment 1) versus oriented gratings (Experiment 2). We measured brain activity in male and female human participants using high-resolution fMRI, in combination with inverted encoding models to reconstruct shape and orientation information. Our results revealed that expectations about shape and orientation evoked distinct representations in the hippocampus. For complex shapes, the hippocampus represented which shape was expected, potentially serving as a source of top-down predictions. In contrast, for simple gratings, the hippocampus represented only unexpected orientations, more reminiscent of a prediction error. We discuss several potential explanations for this content-based dissociation in hippocampal function, concluding that the computational role of the hippocampus in predictive processing may depend on the nature and complexity of stimuli.",Lindsay I Rait;Nicholas B Turk-Browne
392,Sarah M Carpentier,"Understanding how the human brain integrates information from the environment with intrinsic brain signals to produce individual perspectives is an essential element of understanding the human mind. Brain signal complexity, measured with multiscale entropy, has been employed as a measure of information processing in the brain, and we propose that it can also be used to measure the information available from a stimulus. We can directly assess the correspondence between brain signal complexity and stimulus complexity as an indication of how well the brain reflects the content of the environment in an analysis that we term ""complexity matching."" Music is an ideal stimulus because it is a multidimensional signal with a rich temporal evolution and because of its emotion- and reward-inducing potential. When participants focused on acoustic features of music, we found that EEG complexity was lower and more closely resembled the musical complexity compared to an emotional task that asked them to monitor how the music made them feel. Music-derived reward scores on the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire correlated with less complexity matching but higher EEG complexity. Compared to perceptual-level processing, emotional and reward responses are associated with additional internal information processes above and beyond those linked to the external stimulus. In other words, the brain adds something when judging the emotional valence of music.",Andrea R McCulloch;Tanya M Brown;Sarah E M Faber;Petra Ritter;Zheng Wang;Valorie Salimpoor;Kelly Shen;Anthony R McIntosh
393,Zoë Claire Franklin,"There is evidence that action observation (AO) and the processing of action-related words are associated with increased activity in cortical motor regions. Research has examined the effects of AO and action verb processing on activity in the motor system independently. The aim of this experiment was to investigate, for the first time, the modulation of corticospinal excitability and visual attention during the concurrent processing of action verbs and AO stimuli. Twenty participants took part in an integrated transcranial magnetic stimulation and eye-tracking protocol. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was delivered to the hand representation of the left motor cortex during (i) observation of a static hand, (ii) AO of a hand squeezing a sponge, (iii) AO of the same action with an audio recording of the word ""squeeze,"" and (iv) AO of the same action with an audio recording of the word ""green"". Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis and abductor digiti minimi muscles of the right hand. Eye gaze was recorded throughout the four conditions as a proxy for visual attention. Interviews were conducted to discuss participants' preferences and imagery use for each condition. The AO and action verb condition resulted in significantly increased motor evoked potential amplitudes in the abductor pollicis brevis; participants also made significantly more fixations on the sponge and reported wanting to move their hand. The inclusion of auditory action verbs, alongside AO stimuli, in movement simulation interventions could have implications for the delivery of AO interventions for motor (re)learning.",David James Wright;Paul Stewart Holmes
394,Ying Joey Zhou,"Perceptual expectations can change how a visual stimulus is perceived. Recent studies have shown mixed results in terms of whether expectations modulate sensory representations. Here, we used a statistical learning paradigm to study the temporal characteristics of perceptual expectations. We presented participants with pairs of object images organized in a predictive manner and then recorded their brain activity with magnetoencephalography while they viewed expected and unexpected image pairs on the subsequent day. We observed stronger alpha-band (7-14 Hz) activity in response to unexpected compared with expected object images. Specifically, the alpha-band modulation occurred as early as the onset of the stimuli and was most pronounced in left occipito-temporal cortex. Given that the differential response to expected versus unexpected stimuli occurred in sensory regions early in time, our results suggest that expectations modulate perceptual decision-making by changing the sensory response elicited by the stimuli.",Alexis Pérez-Bellido;Saskia Haegens;Floris P de Lange
395,Chiara Ferrari,"Visual processing of human movements is critical for adaptive social behavior. Cerebellar activations have been observed during biological motion discrimination in prior neuroimaging studies and cerebellar lesions may be detrimental for this task. However, whether the cerebellum plays a causal role in biological motion discrimination has never been tested. Here, we addressed this issue in three different experiments by interfering with the posterior cerebellar lobe using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during a biological discrimination task. In Experiment 1 and 2 we found that TMS delivered at onset of the visual stimuli over the vermis (vermal lobule VI), but not over the left cerebellar hemisphere (left lobule VI/Crus I), interfered with participants' ability to distinguish biological from scrambled motion compared to stimulation of a control site (vertex). Interestingly, when stimulation was delivered at a later time point (300 ms after stimulus onset), participants performed worse when TMS was delivered over the left cerebellar hemisphere compared to the vermis and the vertex (Experiment 3). Our data show that the posterior cerebellum is causally involved in biological motion discrimination, and suggest that different sectors of the posterior cerebellar lobe may contribute to the task at different time points.",Andrea Ciricugno;Lorella Battelli;Emily D Grossman;Zaira Cattaneo
396,Lucía Magis-Weinberg,"Cognitive control allows the coordination of cognitive processes to achieve goals. Control may be sustained in anticipation of goal-relevant cues (proactive control) or transient in response to the cues themselves (reactive control). Adolescents typically exhibit a more reactive pattern than adults in the absence of incentives. We investigated how reward modulates cognitive control engagement in a letter-array working memory (WM) task in 30 adolescents (12-17 years) and 20 adults (23-30 years) using a mixed block- and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging design. After a Baseline run without rewards, participants performed a Reward run where 50% trials were monetarily rewarded. Accuracy and reaction time (RT) differences between Reward and Baseline runs indicated engagement of proactive control, which was associated with increased sustained activity in the bilateral anterior insula (AI), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right posterior parietal cortex (PPC). RT differences between Reward and No reward trials of the Reward run suggested additional reactive engagement of cognitive control, accompanied with transient activation in bilateral AI, lateral PFC, PPC, supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex, putamen and caudate. Despite behavioural and neural differences during Baseline WM task performance, adolescents and adults showed similar modulations of proactive and reactive control by reward.",Ruud Custers;Iroise Dumontheil
397,Emilia F Cárdenas,"Pregnancy and the transition to parenthood is an important period marked by dramatic neurobiological and psychosocial changes that may have implications for the health of women and offspring. Although human and non-human animal research suggests the brain undergoes alterations during the peripartum period, these changes are poorly understood. Here, we review existing research, particularly human neuroimaging and psychophysiological research, to examine changes in brain structure and function during the peripartum period and discuss potential implications for the health of women and offspring. First, we discuss the potential causes of these changes across pregnancy, including physiological and psychosocial factors. Next, we discuss the evidence for structural and functional changes in the brain during pregnancy and into the postpartum period, noting the need for research conducted prospectively across human pregnancy. Finally, we propose potential models of individual differences in peripartum neurobiological changes (i.e., hypo-response, typical response, hyper-response) and emphasize the need to consider trajectories of change in addition to pre-existing factors that may predict maternal adjustment to parenthood. We suggest that the consideration of individual differences in neurobiological trajectories across pregnancy may contribute to a better understanding of risk for negative health and behavior outcomes for women and offspring.",Autumn Kujawa;Kathryn L Humphreys
398,Patrick Bach,"Opioid dependent patients are highly sensitized to negative social feedback and increased social rejection sensitivity was linked to adverse treatment outcome, but its neurobiological underpinnings have not been understood yet. The present study investigated gray matter (GM) volume differences between 19 opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) patients and 20 healthy controls using magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry. Associations of GM volumes with subjective feelings of exclusion and inclusion during a social ostracism (Cyberball) paradigm, with rejection sensitivity, social interaction anxiety and social phobia were explored. OMT patients displayed smaller GM volume in the bilateral insula and inferior frontal gyri. Psychometric and task data showed that patients reported significantly higher rejection sensitivity, social anxiety and social phobia scores and felt more excluded and less included during the social ostracism paradigm. Smaller GM volume in the insula was associated with higher subjective exclusion, lower subjective inclusion and higher rejection sensitivity, social anxiety and social phobia scores. Findings indicate that structural deficits in emotion- and anxiety-processing brain regions in OMT patients are associated with increased social rejection sensitivity. As social rejection is a potential trigger for relapse, patients might benefit from therapeutic strategies that promote social integration.",Ulrich Frischknecht;Svenja Klinkowski;Melanie Bungert;Damian Karl;Christian Vollmert;Sabine Vollstädt-Klein;Stefanie Lis;Falk Kiefer;Derik Hermann
399,Francesca Starita,"Extensive literature shows that alexithymia, a subclinical trait defined by difficulties in identifying and describing feelings, is characterized by multifaceted impairments in processing emotional stimuli. Nevertheless, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we hypothesize that alexithymia may be characterized by an alteration in learning the emotional value of encountered stimuli and test this by assessing differences between individuals with low (LA) and high (HA) levels of alexithymia in the computation of reward prediction errors (RPE) during Pavlovian appetitive conditioning. As a marker of RPE, amplitude of the feedback related negativity (FRN) event related potential was assessed while participants were presented with two conditioned stimuli (CS) associated with expected or unexpected feedback, indicating delivery of reward or no-reward. No-reward (vs. reward) feedback elicited the FRN both in LA and HA. However, unexpected (vs. expected) feedback enhanced the FRN in LA, but not HA, indicating impaired computation of RPE in HA. Thus, although HA show preserved sensitivity to rewards, they cannot use this response to update the value of CS that predict them. This impairment may hinder the construction of internal representations of emotional stimuli, leaving individuals with alexithymia unable to effectively recognize, respond and regulate their response to emotional stimuli.",Mattia Pietrelli;Caterina Bertini;Giuseppe di Pellegrino
400,Valentina Metsavaht Cará,"We used fMRI to investigate the effects of exposure to violence on early adolescent brain function in an inhibitory control task. We investigated the association among scores on self-reported exposure to violence, performance and brain activation. Thirty-seven early adolescents (ages 10-14) from a Latin-American urban region participated in the study. Results showed that recent and chronic exposure to violence were associated with less activation of a network of frontal regions, including the anterior cingulate gyrus and the superior frontal cortex; recent exposure to violence was also associated with less activation of the superior parietal lobe. Results also showed that less activation correlated with more prominent deterioration in the performance in the inhibitory control task (increased latency with time). The findings suggest that early adolescence exposure to violence is associated with differences in activation of a neural network commonly associated with executive function and control. The results underscore the urgency of addressing exposure to violence in adolescence, a period of high susceptibility to the environment, and are discussed in the light of the evidence of the effects of violence on adolescent brain function.

401,Walker S Pedersen,"Relative to the centromedial amygdala (CM), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) may exhibit more sustained activation toward threat, sensitivity to unpredictability, and activation during anxious anticipation. These factors are often intertwined. For example, greater BNST (vs. CM) activation during a block of aversive stimuli may reflect either more sustained activation to the stimuli, or greater activation due to the anticipation of upcoming stimuli. To further investigate these questions, we had participants (19 females, 9 males) complete a task adapted from Somerville et al. (2013) during high-resolution 7-Tesla fMRI BOLD acquisition. We found a larger response to negative vs. neutral blocks (sustained threat) than to images (transient) in the BNST, but not the CM. However, in an additional analysis, we also found BNST, but not CM, activation to the onset of the anticipation period on negative vs. neutral trials, possibly contributing to BNST activation across negative blocks. Predictability did not affect CM or BNST activation. These results suggest a BNST role in anxious anticipation and highlight the need for further research clarifying the temporal response characteristics of these regions.",L Tugan Muftuler;Christine L Larson
402,Jakub Kraus,"Social touch may modulate emotions, but the neurobehavioral correlates are poorly understood. Here, we investigated neural responses to a picture of a deceased close person and if neural activity and connectivity are modulated by social touch from one's romantic partner. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we found altered reactivity in several brain areas including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior insula in response to the personal picture compared to a picture of an unfamiliar person. Hand holding with the romantic partner, compared to being alone, reduced reactivity in the ACC and cerebellum and provided subjective comfort. To separate physical touch from the emotional effect of partner presence, we evaluated hand holding with the partner relative to a stranger, and found reduced reactivity in the anterior insula. Connectivity between the anterior insula and the ACC was reduced during partner touch, and the connectivity strength were negatively related to attachment security, with higher reported partner security associated with weaker connectivity. Overall, holding hands with one's partner attenuates reactivity in emotional brain areas and reduces between-region connectivity.",Andreas Frick;Robert Roman;Lenka Jurkovičová;Radek Mareček;Michal Mikl;Milan Brázdil;Mats Fredrikson

To determine feasibility, reliability and validity of the shortened version of the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-10 (QOLIE-10) in a population of refractory epilepsy adult patients in the Colombian Caribbean.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Data were collected from 63 adult refractory epilepsy patients. The ten items of QOLIE-10 were derived from the Spanish version of QOLIE-89. We assess feasibility, validity, factorial analysis with communalities, reliability through internal consistency and sensitivity to change.


RESULTS
Clinical and demographic features were determined; quality of life was established through frequencies. Construct validity: through factor analysis communalities there were no items considered irrelevant and were grouped into one single dimension. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin: 0.891. Bartlett's test of sphericity: p < 0.001. Average intraclass correlation coefficient 0.843. The internal consistency reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.98. The QOLIE-10 questionnaire for the assessment of health-related quality of life was validated in Spanish for adult patients with refractory epilepsy with excellent validity, reliability parameters and easy, quick filling.


CONCLUSIONS
The QOLIE-10 questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool for use in adult patients with refractory epilepsy in Colombia.

Subjective memory complaints (SMC) are considered predictor of cognitive impairment, but are also associated with other factors; social and lifestyle have been the least studied.


AIM
To evaluate SMC and their association with epidemiological, health, social and lifestyle variables.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Cross-sectional epidemiological study of the randomly selected population of Madrid. Telephone interview.


TARGET POPULATION
1,775 over 55 years of age. We asked about QSM, social, economic, health and lifestyle aspects. The Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the COOP-Wonca Quality of Life Questionnaire were administered.


RESULTS
We found statistically significant association of SMC with age, temporal orientation, all variables related to mental health (depression), anxiety, sleep, mental health/GHQ, and quality of life. Association was found with all pain variables and with loneliness. There was no association with specific diseases, except chronic allergy and those linked to pain. The predictors of the SMC were temporal orientation, multimorbidity, mental health/GHQ, anxiety, pain and feeling lonely.


CONCLUSIONS
SMC is a multi-caused symptom. They are associated with lower memory performance, but also with variables related to health, social aspects and lifestyle. When faced with a patient with SMC, which may be due to cognitive impairment because of Alzheimer's disease, these associations should be taken into account to assess this risk and know when follow-up is most needed.",M Montenegro-Peña;D Prada;E García-Mulero;A García-Marín;E J Pedrero-Pérez

Virtual reality therapy (VRT) constitutes a powerful and motivating tool for stroke patients to actively participate in the process of neurorehabilitation, providing augmented performance feedback, with the aim of achieving better therapeutic results owing to the enhancing of neuroplasticity mechanisms.


AIM
To report the most relevant data about the applications of VRT in the post-stroke neurorehabilitation.


DEVELOPMENT
We conducted a PubMed search for articles, latest books, leading clinical practice guidelines, and scientific societies, regarding such applications.


CONCLUSIONS
Different performed randomized clinical trials (RCT) show that VRT safely facilitates in a statistically significant way motor and functional recovery of upper limb, gait, balance, quality of life related to health, and activities of daily living, together with conventional therapy, but have no clearly demonstrated overall superiority to conventional therapy. In this regard, underlying specific mechanisms remain elusive at this stage. Future RCT should define the good responder stroke patient profile based on the VRT used in conjunction with conventional therapy, allowing the generation of neurorehabilitation approaches that combine a customized immersive VRT with the clinical experience of the therapists, to maximize the results. It is necessary to carry out well-designed RCT, including larger samples of appropriately selected stroke subjects, to draft a consensus document that allows recommending, with a greater level of evidence and on a widespread basis, the implementation of VRT as add-on therapy in post-stroke neurorehabilitation. As well as to determine if the beneficial effects are maintained in the long term and to clarify the most suitable treatment schedule.",M T Pérez-Nieves;S Arce-Arce;J Benito-León;D Ezpeleta-Echávarri
407,Clare Lm Kennedy,"Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) play a pivotal role in many stress-related biological processes. In the hippocampus, GCs act through mineralocorticoid (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) to modify gene transcription. Involvement of GCs in biological processes has been studied using the corticosterone (CORT)-synthesis blocker metyrapone. How metyrapone affects GC action at the genomic level is however still unclear. Therefore, we studied the effects of this enzyme blocker on plasma CORT levels and hippocampal MR and GR binding to GC responsive elements (GREs) within the GC target genes Fkbp5 (FK506-binding protein 5), Per1 (Period 1) and Sgk1 (Serum- and glucocorticoid-activated kinase 1), as well as transcriptional responses of these genes under control and acute stress conditions in rats. For comparison, we also studied these endpoints in adrenalectomized (ADX) rats. Although metyrapone had no effect on baseline levels of CORT, the drug increased MR and GR to GRE binding within the GC target genes and the transcriptional activity of these genes. As expected, acute forced swim (FS) stress strongly increased plasma CORT levels, hippocampal MR and GR to GRE binding within Fkbp5, Per1 and Sgk1, and transcriptional activity (mainly hnRNA levels) of these genes. Metyrapone attenuated, but not abolished, these effects of stress on plasma CORT and MR and GR to GRE binding. The drug effects on FS-induced transcriptional activity were gene-dependent with a reduction seen in Fkbp5 hnRNA (but not Fkbp5 mRNA), an enhancement in Per1 hnRNA (but not Per1 mRNA), and no effect on both Sgk1 hnRNA and mRNA levels. ADX however completely abrogated the effects of FS on plasma CORT as well as hippocampal MR and GR to GRE binding and transcriptional responses. Thus, in contrast to ADX, metyrapone produced inconsistent effects on GC-sensitive genomic endpoints that question its suitability as a tool in neuroendocrine and other research.",Sylvia D Carter;Karen R Mifsud;Johannes Mhm Reul
408,Xiaoyu Zhuang,"To inhibit the abnormal aggregation of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is regarded as a potential therapeutic strategy of SOD1-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The addition of tandem MS to the study of SOD1-ligand complexes provides further insight into their gas-phase stability. Monitoring the unfolding of SOD1-ligand complexes using IM-MS allows observation of subtle changes in the protein stability upon ligand binding. From the MS/MS and IM-MS measurements, polydatin and THSG were highlighted as the strongest bound compounds¬¬¬ in the gas phase, both of them appear to provide a stabilizing effect on the SOD1 dimer conformation. In addition, the data of fluorescence assays clearly show the ability of the ligands to inhibit apoSOD1 from aggregation, and polydatin was found to have the strongest inhibitory effect.

PATIENTS
Adult patients with unilateral VS, preoperative calorics, vHIT, and dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) score.


INTERVENTIONS
Surgical resection of VS and postoperative surveys.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
PANQOL scores.


RESULTS
Forty-three patients were included (58.1% women) with a median age of 54 years (range, 28-82). Mean tumor size was 14.8 mm (σ=8.6), and 28 (65.1%) were right-sided. Average preoperative vHIT gain was 0.7 (σ = 0.3). Covert and overt saccades were present in 8 (25%) and 14 (42.4%) patients, respectively. Average preoperative unilateral weakness was 47% (σ = 33.2). Translabyrinthine approach was performed in 26 (60.5%) patients. No significant difference of PANQOL scores was noted at baseline or over time between patients with normal (>0.8) or abnormal (<0.8) gain. Patients with more unilateral weakness (>50%) had significantly higher baseline PANQOL scores compared with those with < 25% or 25 to 50% (p = 0.02), but had significant improvement in scores over time (p = 0.01). Higher preoperative DHI preoperatively was significantly associated with worse PANQOL scores at all timepoints (β=0.57, p = 0.0064). No differences in PANQOL scores amongst surgical approaches were observed.

All have limitations, ranging from limited effectiveness to permanent hearing loss. Corticosteroids have long been used to manage MD due to their relative efficacy and tolerability, but the exact mechanism for disease alleviation is uncertain. Until recently, the precise distribution and role that glucocorticoid receptors play in inner ear diseases have remained largely uninvestigated. Several studies propose they influence mechanisms of fluid regulation through ion and water homeostasis.

RESULTS
Of 770 children with PCM, 57.8% had HL, compared to 45.5% of children without PCM (p < 0.001). Severely malnourished children had significantly higher odds of moderate-profound HL (aOR 2.27, 95% CI 1.47-3.43), high-frequency HL (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.21-2.75), and sensorineural or mixed HL (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05-2.41) compared to children without PCM. Severely malnourished children had significantly worse initial (35.0 dB vs 25.0 dB, p < 0.001), and final median PTA (31.3 dB vs 20.0 dB, p < 0.001) compared to children without PCM. Additionally, HL in children who were moderately and severely malnourished was significantly less likely to improve (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.25-0.82 and aOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9) when compared to those without PCM.

Given the greater prevalence and severity of hearing loss, children with PCM should be considered an at-risk group for poor audiological outcomes, and clinical practice should focus on early treatment and intervention for malnourished children. Routine audiological evaluation should be considered in this population.",Charmee H Mehta;Josh van Swol;James R Dornhoffer;Yuan F Liu;Shaun A Nguyen;Theodore R McRackan;Ted A Meyer
412,Elena Navari,"OBJECTIVE
To assess patterns of end-organ involvement in acute unilateral vestibulopathy (AUV) and to define the recovery.


STUDY DESIGN
Retrospective chart review.


SETTING
Tertiary academic referral hospital.


PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS
Fifty-nine patients fulfilling clinical criteria for AUV and evaluated using the caloric vestibular test, video head impulse test, and both cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, up to 10 days from symptoms onset were included.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Vestibular tests and requirements for vestibular rehabilitation were analyzed.


RESULTS
The most affected end-organ was the horizontal canal (97%), followed by the anterior canal (83%), utricle (73%), posterior canal (46%), and saccule (44%). Nineteen (32%) patients exhibited complete receptors lesion, while 13 (22%) exhibited damage to receptors connected with the superior division of the vestibular nerve (VN). The proportion of patients who underwent vestibular rehabilitation was higher in the latter two groups (58% for both). Partial involvement of the receptors innervated by both the division of the VN, rather than by its superior division, was detected in 22 and 24% of patients, respectively. Total or partial damage to receptors innervated by the inferior VN was not found.


CONCLUSION
Deeper understanding of AUV may be achieved through identification of its patterns. Slightly more than one-half of AUV cases seemed to be associated with a nerve lesion, with a worse clinical outcome. The remaining patients exhibited selective involvement of vestibular receptors, more probably consistent with an intralabyrinthine lesion pattern and experienced better spontaneous recovery.",Augusto Pietro Casani

To examine current practices for postoperative imaging surveillance following vestibular schwannoma resection.


STUDY DESIGN
Cross-sectional survey of practicing neurotologists.


SETTING
Tertiary referral centers.


PATIENTS
Not applicable.


INTERVENTION
Two hundred seventy-six members of the American Neurotology Society were invited to participate. Using a web-based format, respondents self-reported demographic and practice details. Case scenarios were presented. For each scenario, both quantitative and qualitative data were recorded.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Timing, frequency, duration, and modality of postoperative imaging.


RESULTS
For all scenarios, responses were widely disparate with respect to timing, frequency, number, and duration of follow-up imaging. Following gross total resection, respondents most commonly (46.5%) obtain the first magnetic resonance imaging 1 year after surgery, with the most common endpoint to discontinue surveillance imaging at 10 years (34.9%). Tumor beds with postoperative enhancement were generally followed longer than those without enhancement, but with wide variability in practice patterns. The majority of neurotologists do not change surveillance patterns regarding tumor size or completeness of initial resection. Lower volume surgeons appear to be more aggressive with initial surveillance postoperatively than higher volume surgeons.


CONCLUSION
Wide variability exists amongst neurotologists concerning postsurgical tumor surveillance imaging. Despite recent data to suggest more standardized protocols, disparate practice patterns persist. Additional research is needed to this end, as the subsequent establishment of such evidence-based protocols could obviate substantial medical, medico-legal, and economic burdens concerning this patient population.",Eric N Appelbaum;Daniel H Coelho
414,Emily Guazzo,"OBJECTIVE
To prospectively evaluate the incidence, risk factors and natural history of postoperative cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (pCVST) in translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma microsurgical resection and propose a potential management paradigm.


STUDY DESIGN
Prospective, single cohort, multicenter study.


SETTING
State-wide academic tertiary referral centers.


PATIENTS
Fifty-four consecutive patients who underwent translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma resection.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Incidence of pCVST on postoperative imaging on Day 7, Day 28, and 12 months postoperatively. Patients and tumor characteristics, risk factors, length of stay, intraoperative parameters, complications, and follow-up were analyzed.


RESULTS
pCVST was demonstrated in 21 patients (38.9%) on postoperative imaging. All patients with pCVST were treated conservatively and remained asymptomatic in the immediate postoperative period and long-term follow-up. There were no instances of venous infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, or neurological deficits. A majority (61.1%) of pCVST recannalised on long-term follow up with conservative management. There was a statistical association with pCVST and surgery on the side of the non-dominant cerebral venous drainage (n = 17, 80.1%, p = 0.034). Patients with pCVST were significantly more likely to have a postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (n = 5, 23.8%, p = 0.017).


CONCLUSION
The incidence of pCVST following translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma resection is much higher than previously recognized. pCVST is more likely to occur when surgery is performed on tumors situated on the side of non-dominant cerebral venous drainage. Despite the high prevalence of this iatrogenic phenomenon, all patients were asymptomatic and a majority resolved, thereby suggesting that conservative management is safe. Correlation between pCVST and increased incidence of CSF leak requires further investigation.",Benedict Panizza;Andrew Lomas;Martin Wood;Damien Amato;Andrew Alalade;Mitesh Gandhi;James Bowman

Cochlear implantation may cause an increase in the number of macrophages in the human cochlea similar to previous findings in the vestibular endorgans.


BACKGROUND
Macrophages play a key role in both an inflammatory response and homeostatic maintenance. Recently, an increase in the prevalence of macrophages was demonstrated in the human vestibular endorgans after implantation. However, the prevalence of macrophages in the cochlea after implantation is unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the distribution and prevalence of macrophages in implanted human cochleae and the contralateral unimplanted ears.


METHODS
The prevalence of macrophages in the cochlea in 10 human subjects who had undergone unilateral cochlear implantation was studied by light microscopy using anti-Iba1 immunostaining. The densities of macrophages in the osseous spiral lamina (OSL) and Rosenthal's canal (RC) in implanted cochleae were compared with the contralateral unimplanted ears. The distribution of macrophage morphology (amoeboid, transitional, and ramified) was also compared.


RESULTS
There were activated and phagocytosing macrophages within the fibrotic sheath surrounding the electrode track and within fibrous tissue with lymphocytic infiltration in implanted ears. The densities of macrophages in OSL and RC in implanted ears were significantly greater than in unimplanted ears in some areas. There was also a difference in the prevalence of macrophage phenotype between the OSL and RC.


CONCLUSION
An increase in the density of macrophages in the cochlea after cochlear implantation was demonstrated. Both phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory activity of macrophages were suggested by the distribution and prevalence of macrophages in the implanted cochlea.",Alicia M Quesnel;Jennifer T O'Malley;Takefumi Kamakura;Joseph B Nadol

To explore the Nijmegen Questionnaire (NQ) and its relationship to vestibular function tests and symptoms in patients with dizziness; to compare patient characteristics between those with a positive Nijmegen score and patients clinically diagnosed with hyperventilation syndrome (HVS).


STUDY DESIGN
Retrospective case series.


SETTING
Tertiary neurotology referral center.


PATIENTS
Patients seen at vestibular assessment were grouped according to positive (≥24) or negative (<24) Nijmegen scores; secondary analysis was performed on patients grouped by a clinical diagnosis of hyperventilation syndrome.


INTERVENTION(S)
NQ, vestibular function tests, hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), vestibular rehabilitation benefit questionnaire (VRBQ).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
Medical records of patients presenting for vestibular assessment from January to December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, self-reported questionnaire results, HVS diagnosis, vestibular test results, and reported symptoms were recorded.


RESULTS
In total, 359 patients presented for vestibular assessment with completed NQ. One hundred thirty nine patients (39%) had a positive (≥24) Nijmegen score. In 34 patients, a diagnosis of hyperventilation syndrome was recorded; 10 of these patients did not have a positive Nijmegen score.There was no significant difference found in either vestibular lesion type or compensation status between patients with positive and negative Nijmegen scores (p > 0.05). Symptoms commonly described by patients with positive Nijmegen scores include ""blurred vision,"" ""tingling,"" ""anxiety,"" ""shortness of breath,"" ""palpitations,"" ""panic,"" ""numbness,"" ""chest pain,"" and ""chest tightness."" In contrast, when grouped by HVS diagnosis, patients with HVS were significantly more likely to have No Lesion detected on vestibular function testing (p = 0.0366). ""Panic,"" ""anxiety,"" and ""tingling"" were the only significant symptoms reported more often in the HVS diagnosis group, while ""nausea/vomiting"" and ""vertigo"" were reported significantly less frequently compared with the non-HVS diagnosis group.


CONCLUSIONS
Hyperventilation is a complex stimulus, with some effects manifesting in neurotology clinics. This study reveals discrepancies in both vestibular assessment findings and symptom profiles between patients with a positive screening score in the NQ and patients clinically diagnosed with hyperventilation syndrome. This data will inform clinicians' interpretation of the NQ in the neurotologic setting.",Robert W K Williams;Richard Knight;Syed Hashmi;Neil Donnelly;Manohar Bance

To evaluate if patients with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine (VM) by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria have meaningful differences in symptomatology and disease characteristics when compared to patients with concurrent vestibular symptoms and migraine that do not meet ICHD criteria.


METHODS
Patients who presented for the evaluation of vertigo were provided a detailed questionnaire about dizziness and migraine symptoms. Patients were assigned to either VM cohort (met ICHD criteria for VM) or migraine headache (MH) cohort (met ICHD criteria for migraine with or without aura but not VM). Disease characteristics, symptomatology, quality of life, and perceived stress score were compared between the cohorts.


RESULTS
The VM cohort demonstrated a shorter duration of vertigo episodes, 11 ± 22 hours versus 84 ± 146 hours in the MH cohort. In the VM cohort, 81% reported experiencing migraine headaches during episodes of vertigo, versus 61% in the MH cohort. All patients in the VM cohort reported a previous diagnosis of migraine headache, whereas 9% of the MH cohort had not been previously diagnosed by another physician. There was no difference in quality of life or perceived stress scores between the cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
A large proportion of vertigo patients with migrainous features do not meet the ICHD criteria for VM. The differences between cohorts represent selection bias rather than meaningful features unique to the cohorts. As such, VM and MH with vestibular symptoms may exist on a spectrum of the same disease process and may warrant the same treatment protocols.",Khodayar Goshtasbi;Omid Moshtaghi;Donald Tan;Harrison W Lin;Hamid R Djalilian

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor plays an important role in the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-induced otitis media.


BACKGROUND
NLRP3 inflammasome and macrophage migration inhibitory factor are critical molecules mediating inflammation. However, the interaction between the NLRP3 inflammasome and macrophage migration inhibitory factor has not been fully examined.


METHODS
Wild-type mice and macrophage migration inhibitory factor gene-deficient (MIF) mice received a transtympanic injection of either lipopolysaccharide or phosphate-buffered saline. The mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the injection. Concentrations of IL-1β, NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain and a pyrin domain), and caspase-1 in the middle ear effusions were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Temporal bones were processed for histologic examination and immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
In the immunohistochemical study using the wild-type mice, positive staining of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 were observed in infiltrating inflammatory cells induced by lipopolysaccharide in the middle ear. The number of inflammatory cells caused by lipopolysaccharide administration decreased remarkably in the MIF mice as compared with the wild-type mice. The concentrations of IL-1β, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 increased in the lipopolysaccharide-treated wild-type mice. The MIF mice with lipopolysaccharide had decreased levels of IL-1β, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 as compared with the wild-type mice.


CONCLUSION
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor has an important role in the production of IL-1β and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Controlling the inflammation by modulating macrophage migration inhibitory factor and the NLRP3 inflammasome may be a novel therapeutic strategy for otitis media.",Mitsuhiro Okano;Pengfei Zhao;Yukihide Maeda;Yuko Kataoka;Takaya Higaki;Seiichiro Makihara;Jun Nishihira;Tomoyasu Tachibana;Kazunori Nishizaki

Severe vertigo with vomiting and left hearing impairment ensued. In addition, high-resolution computed tomography demonstrated an air density within the vestibule.

420,Annick Gilles,"INTRODUCTION
It was previously demonstrated that tinnitus due to profound unilateral hearing loss can be treated by the use of electrical stimulation via a cochlear implant (CI) with long-lasting positive effects. In cases where patients are not suitable for cochlear implantation due to aplasia/hypoplasia, cochlear malformations etc., an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) may be a solution. While auditory performance with ABI is well investigated, it is currently unknown whether stimulation through ABI also renders tinnitus reduction in patients with incapacitating tinnitus. The current case study reports on the subjective tinnitus perception during a 5-year follow-up period. In addition, a first H2O PET imaging study in an ABI patient is carried out revealing underlying neural substrates of tinnitus.


METHODS
A 56-year-old male single-sided deaf patient with incapacitating tinnitus received an ABI after insufficient auditory performances and only minor tinnitus reduction with CI. Audiological follow-up was carried out during a 5-year follow-up period comprising pure-tone audiometry, speech-in-quiet testing, speech-in-noise testing, tinnitus questionnaires (tinnitus questionnaire and numeric rating scale) and the HISQUI19 questionnaire. To investigate the neural substrates of tinnitus in this subject, H2O PET tomography scans were acquired in three different conditions: 1) ABI switched off which was considered as the resting-state measurement rendering the loudest possible tinnitus for the patient (ABI OFF); 2) ABI switched on causing a small suppression of tinnitus due to electrical stimulation (ABI ON); 3) ABI switched on and 70 dB SPL white noise presented directly to the external audio processor through a direct audio cable providing the maximum tinnitus suppression for the patient (NOISE).


RESULTS
Subjectively the patient reported a significant tinnitus reduction after implantation which remained stable over time with a decrease in tinnitus questionnaire from grade 4 to grade 2 and a 50% reduction in the numeric rating scale (from 8 to 4) during the 5-year period. Comparing the ABI OFF and ABI ON conditions, significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was observed in brain areas involved in the salience network showing already suppression of tinnitus only by electrical stimulation in the absence of auditory stimuli. The NOISE condition showed relatively decreased rCBF in the insula (as well as in the orbitofrontal cortex) as compared with the ABI OFF condition. Abnormally activated areas comprising the salience network may have been significantly suppressed by the NOISE condition both by acoustic and electrical stimulations of the auditory pathway. Moreover, the NOISE condition showed significantly decreased rCBF in the parahippocampus as compared with the ABI OFF condition. This finding supports the idea of distinct tinnitus generators depending on the amount of hearing loss.


CONCLUSION
The reduction of tinnitus in the current ABI subject may be attributable to partial peripheral reafferentation-induced deactivation of the parahippocampus-based tinnitus generator as well as the salience network. Further validation is required by the use of a follow-up study with a larger number of subjects.",Jae-Jin Song;Anouk Hofkens-Van den Brandt;Griet Mertens;Cordula Matthies;Steven Staelens;Sigrid Stroobants;Olivier Vanderveken;Vedat Topsakal;Paul Van de Heyning;Vincent Van Rompaey
421,Matthew Ryan,"HYPOTHESIS
Round window velocity measurements should correlate closely with vibration measurements taken at proximal points along an intact chain over a set frequency range. These round window vibration measurements should be similar to the vibration measurements taken of the ossicles if mechanical energy is conserved through the vestibular organ.


BACKGROUND
To date there has not been a study which compares vibratory velocity measurements through an intact ossicular chain to the level of the round window. This study attempted to quantify the degree of mechanical energy transmission and suspected dissipation through the ossicular chain and vestibular organ through incus, stapes, and round window velocity measurements in response to sound stimulus.


METHODS
Five thawed human temporal bones with intact ossicular chain and tympanic membrane underwent complete mastoidectomy and a facial recess approach. A laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) was mounted on the operating microscope to measure vibration of incus, stapes, and round window in response to a sound stimulus within the external auditory canal. Sound stimulus frequencies ranged from 0.5 to 4 kHz at 90 dB SPL.


RESULTS
Vibration velocity was measured across the frequency range for each incus, stapes, and round window. Vibration velocity curves obtained over the frequency range were similar for each of the bones with a notable resonant frequency around 2 kHz. The incus and stapes curve amplitudes were nearly identical with similar maximum velocity and frequency at which this maximal velocity was noted. Round window vibration velocity demonstrated a unique peak velocity. Transfer function measurements of the stapes and round window demonstrated markedly similar curves. The variation in velocity between temporal bones in response to the standardized stimulus was more dramatic in the round window measurements when compared with the incus and stapes.


CONCLUSIONS
This study supports the concept that round window transfer function is equivalent to stapes footplate transfer function when subjected to the same acoustic stimuli. This study also demonstrates that the round window is a much more difficult target to measure when using LDV technology and improvements in experimental design are required to better understand round window physiology in relation to transfer of acoustic vibratory stimulus transferred throughout the middle ear. A complete and thorough understanding of the biophysical properties of the middle and inner ear are critical for optimal ossiculoplasty outcomes and the development of future ossicular prosthetics.",John Lally;Jason K Adams;Sophie Higgins;Mostafa Ahmed;James Aden;Carlos Esquivel;Samuel A Spear

Describe long-term trends and stability of hearing outcomes for patients undergoing primary congenital aural atresia (CAA) repair.


STUDY DESIGN
Retrospective chart review.


SETTING
Single academic, tertiary referral center.


PATIENTS
Children and adults who underwent primary CAA repair between 1980 and 2017.


INTERVENTION
CAA repair.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Long-term (> 1 yr) postoperative three-tone (500, 1000, 2000 Hz) air conduction pure-tone average (AC PTA) compared with the immediate (within 90 d of surgery) postoperative audiogram.


RESULTS
The mean preoperative AC PTA was 59.6 dB HL. CAA repair improved hearing an average of 30.5 dB, but hearing declined by 8.2 dB over the long-term follow-up period (mean 4.4 yr; range 1-15.7 yr), leaving a final mean improvement of 22.2 dB (final mean AC PTA 37.3 dB HL). Two-thirds (92 of 138 ears) had an AC PTA ≤ 30 dB HL recorded in the first year after surgery. At the last follow-up test, 64% had ""stable"" hearing defined as no more than a 10 dB decline in AC PTA compared with the immediate postoperative audiogram; 21% had a 10 to 20 dB decline, 8% a 20 to 30 dB decline, and 7% declined > 30 dB.


CONCLUSIONS
All patients enjoyed improvement in AC PTA after surgery (preoperative minus the best postoperative PTA, mean = 34 dB, range = 3.3-52 dB). Hearing declined by an average 8.2 dB over the long-term leaving a final average AC PTA of 37.4 dB HL. Sixty-four percent of patients exhibited stable (< 10 dB loss) hearing over time; 36% lost 10 dB or more over the long-term follow-up period. Hearing results typically stabilize over time with most of the change occurring in the first 3 years after CAA repair.

During skull base tumor surgery, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dissection is commonly performed. The impact of this procedure on patients' postoperative diet and TMJ function is a matter of concern to surgeons.


METHODS
We reviewed the Craniomandibular Index (CMI) for 32 patients (15 men and 17 women) who underwent TMJ dissection during surgery for skull base tumors between August 2015 and May 2018.


RESULTS
Fifteen patients underwent removal of the mandibular condyle, and 17 had the condyle preserved. Twenty-one patients mainly underwent infratemporal fossa approach, and 11 underwent extended temporal bone resection. No significant difference between pre- and postoperative diet was observed in any group. Significant differences in CMI index were seen in all groups. The highest score was 0.115 of Dysfunction Index, observed postoperatively in the group that underwent condyle removal.

For skull base tumor surgery, TMJ dissection has no significant impact on postoperative diet. Patients who underwent removal of the mandibular condyle have significantly worse postoperative TMJ function.",Zhiqiang Gao;Tao Zhang;Zhuhua Zhang;Xu Tian;Yang Zhao;Yalin Zhou;Guodong Feng
424,Anton Rönnblom,"OBJECTIVE
We compared the sound transmission using different types of total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORP); we then studied the performance of a new TORP that we designed inspired by the columella, the single ossicle found in birds.


METHODS
Stapedial vibrations were measured on nine freshly frozen human temporal bones with laser Doppler vibrometry. We then compared the performances of eight common TORP positions or designs as well as the new silver prototype of bird-type prosthesis, designed also according to our digital holography patterns of the human tympanic membrane (TM).


RESULTS
The TORPs placed in lateral contact with both the TM and the malleus handle outperformed, at most frequencies, those placed only in contact with the TM.The new bird-type prosthesis performed equally well or better than all other prostheses.


CONCLUSION
If the malleus handle can be retained when placing a TORP, the best sound transmission can be achieved by placing the TORP in contact with both the distal part of the malleus handle and the TM. The good performance of our bird-type prosthesis suggests that there is still room for future improvement of prosthesis design to further optimize hearing outcomes after surgery.",Kilian Gladiné;Anders Niklasson;Magnus von Unge;Joris Dirckx;Krister Tano

To assess for any association between the presence of superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) and temporal bone pneumatization and the height of middle fossa in symptomatic patients.


STUDY DESIGN

SETTING
Tertiary, university referral center.


PATIENTS
Symptomatic patients with SSCD and a matched group of non-SSCD patients.


INTERVENTION
High-resolution computed tomography of the temporal bones.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We graded the temporal bone pneumatization using the Virapongse classification and measured the distance between the middle fossa and the lateral semicircular canal on coronal plane at the most anterior aspect of the lateral and superior semicircular canals. We statistically compared all parameters (level of significance 0.05).


RESULTS
We enrolled 30 patients with SSCD, (males = 13, females = 17) with mean age of 47 years (SD: 26). The matched control group had similar baseline characteristics (p > 0.05). Grade 4 pneumatization was noted in 83.3% (n = 25) of SSCD patients with the remainder having grade 3. In the control group, 46.6% (n = 14) had a grade 4 pneumatization, 36.6% (n = 11) grade 3 and 16.6 5 (n = 5) grade 2. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.003). The difference in the height of the middle cranial fossa between the two groups was also statistically significant (mean 3.80 [SD: 0.84] in SSCD group and 4.68 mm [SD: 0.85] in the control group; p < 0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS

426,Sarra Djemil,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are known to play a role in cognitive functions of the hippocampus, such as memory consolidation. Given that they conduct Ca2+ and are capable of regulating the release of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) within the hippocampus, thereby shifting the excitatory-inhibitory ratio, we hypothesized that the activation of nAChRs will result in the potentiation of hippocampal networks and alter synchronization. We used nicotine as a tool to investigate the impact of activation of nAChRs on neuronal network dynamics in primary embryonic rat hippocampal cultures prepared from timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. We perturbed cultured hippocampal networks with increasing concentrations of bath-applied nicotine and performed network extracellular recordings of action potentials using a microelectrode array (MEA). We found that nicotine modulated network dynamics in a concentration-dependent manner; it enhanced firing of action potentials as well as facilitated bursting activity. In addition, we used pharmacological agents to determine the contributions of discrete nAChR subtypes to the observed network dynamics. We found that β4-containing nAChRs are necessary for the observed increases in spiking, bursting and synchrony, while the activation of α7 nAChRs augments nicotine-mediated network potentiation but is not necessary for its manifestation. We also observed that antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) partially blocked the effects of nicotine. Furthermore, nicotine exposure promoted autophosphorylation of Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and serine 831 phosphorylation of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1. These results suggest that nicotinic receptors induce potentiation and synchronization of hippocampal networks and glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Findings from this work highlight the impact of cholinergic signaling in generating network-wide potentiation in the form of enhanced spiking and bursting dynamics that coincide with molecular correlates of memory such as increased phosphorylation of CaMKII and GluA1.",Xin Chen;Ziyue Zhang;Jisoo Lee;Mikael Rauf;Daniel T S Pak;Rhonda Dzakpasu
427,Yu-Shian Chen,"NMDA receptor channels are activated by glutamate (or NMDA) and glycine. The channels also undergo desensitization, which denotes decreased channel availability, after prolonged exposure to the activating ligands. Glycine apparently has a paradoxical negative effect on desensitization, as increase of ambient glycine in concentrations required for channel activation would increase sustained NMDA receptor currents. We hypothesize that this classical ""glycine-dependent desensitization"" could be glycine-dependent activation in essence. By performing electrophysiological recordings and biophysical analyses with rat brain NMDA receptors heterogeneously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we characterized that the channel opened by ""only"" NMDA (in nominally glycine-free condition probably with the inevitable nanomolar glycine) would undergo a novel form of deactivation rather than desensitization, and is thus fully available for subsequent activation. Moreover, external tetrapentylammonium ions (TPentA), tetrabutylammonium ions, and tetrapropylammonium ions (TPA, in higher concentrations) block the pore and prohibit channel desensitization with a simple ""foot-in-the-door"" hindrance effect. TpentA and TPA have the same voltage dependence but show different flow dependence in binding affinity, revealing a common binding site at an electrical distance of ~ 0.7 from the outside yet differential involvement of the flux-coupling region in the external pore mouth. The smaller tetraethylammonium ion and the larger tetrahexylammonium and tetraheptylammonium ions may block the channel but could not affect desensitization. We conclude that NMDA receptor desensitization requires concomitant binding of both glycine and glutamate, and thus movement of both GluN1 and GluN2 subunits. Desensitization itself embodies a highly restricted pore reduction with a physical distance of ~ 4 Å from the charged nitrogen atom of bound tetraalkylammonium ions, and is located very close to the activation gate in the bundle-crossing region in the external vestibule.",Ya-Chi Tu;Yi-Chen Lai;Erin Liu;Ya-Chin Yang;Chung-Chin Kuo
428,Yann S Mineur,"Optimal acetylcholine (ACh) signaling is important for sustained attention and facilitates learning and memory. At the same time, human and animal studies have demonstrated increased levels of ACh in the brain during depressive episodes and increased symptoms of anxiety, depression and reactivity to stress when ACh breakdown is impaired. While it is possible that the neuromodulatory roles of ACh in cognitive and affective processes are distinct, one possibility is that homeostatic levels of ACh signaling are necessary for appropriate learning, but overly high levels of cholinergic signaling promote encoding of stressful events, leading to the negative encoding bias that is a core symptom of depression. In this review we outline this hypothesis, and suggest potential neural pathways and underlying mechanisms that may support a role for ACh signaling in negative encoding bias.",Marina R Picciotto

Assessing the reliability of electrical pain threshold (PT) and evaluating the impact of stimulation frequency at different locations in the healthy lower urinary tract (LUT).


METHODS
Ninety subjects (age: 18.3-35.8 years, 40 females, 50 males) were randomly allocated to one stimulation site (bladder dome [BD], trigone, proximal, membranous (only males), or distal urethra). Using 0.5 Hz/1.1 Hz/1.6 Hz electrical stimulation (square wave, pulse width:1 ms), current perception thresholds (CPTs), PTs and tolerance thresholds were assessed at two visits. Analyses were performed using linear mixed models, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman method.


RESULTS
PTs vary in relation to stimulation frequency, location and between genders. PT decreased with higher stimulation frequency. The highest PTs were measured at the BD and membranous urethra with males reporting higher PTs than females. Reliability of PT assessments according to ICC was good to excellent across all frequencies, locations, and genders (ICC = 0.61-0.97), except for BD and distal urethra in females showing poor to fair reliability (BD: all frequencies, distal urethra: 0.5 Hz).


CONCLUSIONS
PTs can be safely and reliably assessed from bladder and urethral locations. Semi-objective PT assessment may provide additional information on functionality and sensitivity of the LUT slow fiber afferents and complement findings from urodynamic investigations and CPT assessments. In conclusion, the developed methodology may open new opportunities for using electrical stimulation paradigms for LUT PT assessments and diagnostics.

Nocturia or waking at night, to urinate is a common cause of awakenings and may lead to sleep disturbance, impaired somatic health, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality. The aim of this report is to point out and discuss the aspects and issues that need to be addressed to improve the care of nocturia.

This paper is a report of the presentations and subsequent discussion of a Think Tank session at the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS) in June 2018 in Bristol.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Nocturia is a known risk factor for in-hospital falls. Unfortunately, its assessment in acutely hospitalized (older) people is not the current practice and ward-based care plans are not tailored to this symptom. A new care pathway for hospitalized patients who have nocturia should be considered. More research into the relation of cardiovascular disorders and nocturnal polyuria (NP) is warranted and management of NP patients may be improved by involving a cardiologist in their management. There is definitely a need for phenotyping nocturia in relation to bladder capacity, filling phase, and emptying phase symptoms and how to treat the different phenotypes. In the near future, smart automated monitoring devices and applications might help us to diagnose and treat nocturia with less efforts.",Paul Abrams;Wendy Bower;Stefan De Wachter;Matthew Epstein;Riccardo Lombardo;Dudley Robinson;Andrea Tubaro;Alan Wein;Jeffrey P Weiss;Karel Everaert

To review current prevention strategies for urinary incontinence among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).


METHODS
This is a consensus report of the proceedings of a research proposal from the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS), 14 to 16 June 2018 (Bristol, UK): ""How can we prevent postprostatectomy incontinence by patient selection, and by preoperative, peroperative, and postoperative measures?""


RESULTS
Several baseline parameters were proposed as predicting factors for postprostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPUI), including age, tumor stage, prostate volume, preoperative lower urinary tract symptoms, maximum urethral closure pressure, and previous transurethral resection of the prostate. More recently, magnetic resonance imaging has been used to measure the membranous urethral length and sphincter volume. Peroperative techniques include preservative and reconstructive approaches. Bladder neck preservation improved early (6 months), as well as long-term (>12 months) continence rates. Several prospective studies have reported earlier return of continence following preservation of puboprostatic ligaments, although no long-term data are available. Preservation of the urethral length yielded controversial outcomes. Concerning postoperative strategies, it is probably optimal to remove the catheter in a window between 4 and 7 days if clinically appropriate; however, more research in this regard is still required. Postoperative PFME (preoperative pelvic floor muscle exercise) appears to speed up the recovery of continence after RP.


CONCLUSIONS
Conservative strategies to prevent PPUI include proper patient selection and PFME. Peroperative techniques have largely shown benefit in the short term. Postoperative complications and timing of trial without catheter can influence continence status. Future research initiatives must assess peroperative and postoperative measures, with longer-term follow-up.",Tom Marcelissen;Ralf Anding;Mohammad S Rahnama'i;Arun Sahai;Andrea Tubaro

Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A), sacral nerve stimulation (SNM), and posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) are established treatments for idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) refractory to oral drug therapy. At the ICI-RS meeting in Bristol in 2018 a think tank was convened to address the question of how to better manage drug-resistant OAB/DO (detrusor overactivity).


METHODS
The think tank conducted a literature review and an expert consensus meeting focusing on the evidence for predicting response and adverse events (AEs) with the current therapies for drug-resistant idiopathic OAB.


RESULTS
Several factors have been associated with poor outcomes using BTX-A including increasing age, body mass index, male sex, and frailty. Voiding dysfunction with BTX-A also appears to be more prevalent in those with increasing age, male sex, higher baseline postvoid residual and with poorer contractility as assessed by urodynamic parameters. SNM full implantation appears to be higher with the first stage tined lead placement procedure compared to percutaneous nerve evaluation. Urodynamics do not appear to predict outcomes with SNM. Patients with psychiatric comorbidity are more likely to experience AEs with SNM. Outcomes related to lead positioning and the number of active electrodes are mixed in predicting long term success. Patients with increased daytime frequency and lower first sensation of bladder filling were independent factors associated with success with PTNS.


CONCLUSIONS
Further research is required to optimize these procedures and to better understand which patients will benefit from the various options available in managing refractory OAB.",Brigitte Schurch;Mohammad S Rahnama'i;Marcio A Averbeck;Sachin Malde;Vito Mancini;Francoise Valentini;Arun Sahai

Dysfunctional voiding (DV) remains a poorly understood and a poorly managed problem, both in children and adults. The Think Tank (TT) discussed how to improve the management of DV in these two different age groups and in transitional care.


METHODS
During the 2018 International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society held in Bristol, a multidisciplinary TT on DV was created. The presentations and subsequent discussion, leading to research recommendations intended to improve the management of DV in children and adults are summarized.


RESULTS
To improve the management of DV in children and adults, the TT panel proposed: (1) to conduct reliable prevalence studies of DV; (2) to perform longitudinal studies to prospectively test the sequence hypothesis by answering the following questions: (a) Which, if any children show a progression from overactive bladder or voiding postponement to DV?; (b) Which children develop each disorder without precursors?; and (c) Is there a continuation of DV from childhood to adulthood, or are adult cases new-onset presentations?; (3) to obtain detailed information regarding psychopathology to understand which comorbid psychological disorders prevail and at which rate, in those suffering DV; (4) to develop and validate diagnostic tools specifically for DV; (5) to better establish urodynamic correlates of DV specific for different age groups; and (6) to generate prospective long-term data regarding the efficacy of different treatment options and management strategies.


CONCLUSIONS
The future research recommendations of this TT may improve our management of DV in children and adults.",Alexander von Gontard;Apostolos Apostolidis;Giovanni Mosiello;Paul Abrams

Review the literature in the light of the think tank discussions.


RESULTS
All guidelines recommend different levels of treatment starting with conservative behavioral treatments then introducing oral treatments followed by intravesical instillations. If these treatments fail then more invasive treatments such as botulinum toxin injections, neuromodulation, or surgery could be suggested.

Different patterns of detrusor overactivity (DO) have been described and included in several standardization terminology documents. However, it is unclear if these different patterns have any clinical significance.


METHODS
This is a report of the proceedings of Proposal 3: ""Are there different patterns of detrusor overactivity which are clinically relevant?"" from the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICIRS) meeting, which took place from 14 to 16 June 2018, in Bristol, UK.


RESULTS
We have collected and discussed, as a committee, the evidence about different urodynamic (UD) patterns of detrusor overactivity and their potential clinical significance. We reviewed the important previous basic research and clinical studies and compiled summaries. The discussion focused on clinical relevance of different UD patterns of DO and what further research is required.


CONCLUSIONS
There are several UD definitions of patterns of detrusor overactivity, however the clinical relevance of these definitions remains unclear. Future research should concentrate on defining the pattern of DO in relation to clinical diagnosis, gender, age, and treatment outcomes.",Andrew Gammie;John Speich;Ruth Kirschner-Hermanns;Stefan De Wachter;Brigitte Schurch;Cees Korstanje;Francoise Valentini;Mohammad Sajjad Rahnama'i
436,Chris Harding,"BACKGROUND
Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) is a chronic condition and has a significant impact on health-related quality of life. The commonly used definition for rUTI is greater than three episodes in a year or more than two in 6 months. Current diagnostic methods have been used worldwide for over five decades, despite well evidenced criticism. Enhanced culture techniques demonstrate that the microbiome of the bladder is far more complex than previously thought and begs a reappraisal of our current testing. Treatment of rUTI is based on a small number of antibiotic trials with some evidence showing a reduction in the number of positive cultures, but one must be cautious in interpreting the results and weigh against the risk of generation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).


AIM
The International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society think tank reviewed the literature with a view to improving investigation, prevention and treatment of rUTI.


METHODS
A multidisciplinary team of experts were invited to present evidence regarding the current diagnostic methods, recent advances related to bladder biome mapping and current treatment strategies, including antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. Current guidelines regarding antibiotic stewardship and concerns regarding AMR were discussed.


DISCUSSION
Outcome of the think tank discussions are summarised with a set of recommendations to inform future research. Particular consideration is given to bacterial survival in the bladder after treatment as well as defects in urothelial barrier function which may play a significant part in the failure to eradicate UTI.",Angela Rantell;Linda Cardozo;Susan Kim Jacobson;Ralf Anding;Ruth Kirschner-Hermanns;Tamsin Greenwell;Sheela Swamy;Sachin Malde;Paul Abrams

To evaluate the relationship between obesity and urinary incontinence (UI) and to determine the effect of weight reduction on the severity of incontinence.


METHODS
This is a consensus report of the proceedings of a Research Proposal from the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society, 14 June to 16 June, 2018 (Bristol, UK): ""What are the relationships between obesity and UI, and the effects of successful bariatric surgery?""


RESULTS
Obesity is an increasing problem worldwide and is associated with many adverse effects on health and quality of life. From both translational and clinical studies, there is a strong relationship between obesity and the occurrence of UI. Both mechanical and metabolic factors seem to play an important role including systemic inflammation and oxidative stress due to the release of cytokines in visceral adipose tissue. The success rate of anti-incontinence surgery does not seem to be greatly affected by body mass index (BMI), although reliable data and long-term follow-up are currently lacking. Both weight reduction programs and bariatric surgery can result in amelioration of UI. Various studies have shown that weight loss (particularly that associated with bariatric surgery) can reduce incontinence, and the degree of weight loss is positively correlated with improvement in symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Obesity is strongly associated with an increased prevalence of both stress and urgency UI. The treatment outcome does not seem to be highly dependent on BMI. Weight reduction is positively correlated with improvement of incontinence symptoms and therefore should be advocated in the management.",Ralf Anding;Marcio Averbeck;Ann Hanna-Mitchell;Sajjad Rahnama'i;Linda Cardozo

Male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common and bothersome symptoms in the aging population, of which the etiology is multifactorial. Prostatic surgery may be considered to alleviate some of these LUTS, especially in patients in which benign prostatic obstruction is believed to be the underlying cause. The aim of this paper is to discuss underlying pathophysiology, signs, and conditions that may lead to success or failure after prostatic surgery in male patients with LUTS.


METHODS
The paper is a report of presentations and subsequent discussions at the annual International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society, in June 2018 in Bristol.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Unfavorable outcomes after prostatic surgery are reported in 25% to 30% of the patients. This may be due to persistent or de novo symptoms, related to the multifactorial origin of symptoms. Specific underlying conditions such as with detrusor overactivity, detrusor underactivity, and nocturnal polyuria are discussed in their relationship with prostatic surgery. Knowledge gaps are addressed and specific research questions proposed.",Francois Hervé;Marcio Averbeck

Efforts to engineer and repair genitourinary tissue to treat lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) have recently increased thanks in part to advances in stem cell (SC) research. At the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society meeting in Bristol in 2018 a proposal was convened to address the question: has the potential of SCs in treating LUTD reached clinical maturity?


METHODS
The proposal conducted a literature review and an expert consensus meeting focusing on available data from animal models and clinical trials involving the use of SCs for LUTD.


RESULTS
To date, there are only small studies investigating bladder replacement using scaffolds with or without SC. Results have been conflicting because of the variability in cell numbers, biomaterials types, and graft surface differences. Similarly, preclinical results suggest a possible role of SC in bladder outlet obstruction (BOO); however, SC clinical trials for BOO are lacking. Research into the use of SC for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is close to reaching clinical maturity. In the Canadian phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT), a beneficial effect of adult muscle-derived cells (AMDC) over placebo was detected in reducing the frequency of incontinence episodes, especially after prior anti-incontinence surgery. Only two small studies have been published on male SUI.


CONCLUSIONS
Questions remain regarding the mechanism of action of SC injected into the LUT and the viability of cells seeded onto grafts placed into the LUT. Also, the optimal time for intervention with SC therapy in the LUT remains to be elucidated.",Iraklis Mitsogiannis;Paul Abrams;Apostolos Apostolidis

The regulatory warnings about the safety of the synthetic midurethral slings (MUS) had a significant effect on how patients and physicians approach surgical management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). In this changing landscape, the purpose of this research Think Tank (TT) was to provide an update of the current knowledge about the safety and efficacy of SUI surgery, to review patient goals and expectations and to identify factors affecting the decision making for surgery.


METHODS
This is a consensus report of the proceedings of TT3: ""Do we need better information to advise women with stress incontinence on their choice of surgery?"" from the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS), June 2018.


RESULTS
Despite the body of evidence supporting the continued use of MUS, the short follow-up of most of the studies and the lack of ""real life"" data regarding pain and sexual dysfunction make the development of recommendations challenging. Women with SUI are often happy to ""trade"" efficacy for a procedure with less associated morbidity and therefore it is not always the procedure with the highest success rate that is ultimately chosen. However, a number of factors influence treatment decision and there is limited evidence about what level of all these factors women are willing to tolerate for a given success rate, or how much success they are willing to trade for a lower complication rate.

The quality of urodynamic measurements in clinical practice has been debated as a matter of concern. It is considered plausible that this has a direct bearing on patient care and the perceived value of urodynamic testing.


METHODS
This is a report of the proceedings of the Think Tank: ""Is the value of urodynamics undermined by poor technique?"" from the Annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society, which took place in June 2018 in Bristol, UK. The Think Tank discussed the evidence for deficiencies in urodynamic test quality and considered the implications of improvements for clinical diagnosis and practice.


RESULTS
There is evidence that technique affects urodynamic quality, and that urodynamic practice is variable. Factors such as team skill set, technologies used, and training received will also affect the quality of urodynamic service. Questions exist regarding the influence of technique on the utility and perceived value of urodynamics.

Mounting evidence from experimental animal and human studies suggests that cross-sensitization exists between different organs. Lower urinary tract (LUT) and bowel dysfunction commonly overlap, and the role of cross-sensitization between pelvic visceral organs is uncertain.


METHODS
At the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI-RS) meeting in 2018, a panel of clinicians participated in a discussion on bladder and bowel interactions in the context of pelvic organ cross-sensitization.


RESULTS
Bladder and bowel problems commonly co-occur in adults and children across different disorders, and the mechanism responsible for overlapping dysfunction is uncertain in most instances. At a neuronal level, cross-sensitization occurs as a result of afferent signaling from the LUT and lower bowel through different central and peripheral mechanisms. Studies in animals and humans have demonstrated evidence for cross-organ sensitization following experimental inflammation or distension of the lower bowel, affecting the LUT. Nerve stimulation is an effective treatment for different functional LUT and bowel disorders, and whether this treatment may influence cross-organ sensitization remains uncertain. The role of physiologically dormant C-fibers, the bladder-gut-brain axis, and gut microbiome in cross-sensitization are speculative.


CONCLUSION
Recommendations for research were made to explore the role of cross-organ sensitization in the pathogenesis of co-occurring LUT and bowel dysfunction in humans.",Tom Marcelissen;Alexander von Gontard;Desiree Vrijens;Paul Abrams;Michel Wyndaele
444,Danielle McAuliffe,"Children with ADHD show developmentally abnormal levels of mirror overflow-unintentional movements occurring symmetrically opposite of intentional movements. Because mirror overflow correlates with ADHD behavioral symptoms, the study of disinhibition in motor control may shed light on physiologic mechanisms underlying impaired behavioral/cognitive control. This is a case-controlled study of EEG recording from 25 children with ADHD and 25 typically-developing (TD) controls performing unilateral sequential finger-tapping, with overflow movements measured using electronic goniometers. Consistent with previously published findings, children with ADHD showed increased mirror overflow as compared with TD peers. EEG findings revealed less lateralized alpha modulation (event-related desynchronization; ERD) and decreased magnitude of beta ERD in ADHD; both alpha and beta ERD reflect cortical activation. Moderation analysis revealed a significant association between beta ERD and overflow, independent of diagnosis; and an equivocal (p = .08) effect of diagnosis on the relationship between alpha ERD and overflow, with a significant effect in children with ADHD but not TD children. These results suggest two mechanisms involved with mirror overflow: one reflected in beta ipsilateral to the intentional movement and relevant to both children with ADHD and controls, and the other seemingly more specific to ADHD (alpha, contralateral to movement).",Kathryn Hirabayashi;Jack H Adamek;Yu Luo;Deana Crocetti;Ajay S Pillai;Yi Zhao;Nathan E Crone;Stewart H Mostofsky;Joshua B Ewen

Neuronal cell cultures are widely used in the field of neuroscience. Cell dissociation allows for the isolation of a desired cell type, yet the neuronal complexity that distinguishes the nervous system is often lost as a result. Thus, culturing neural tissues in ex vivo format provides a physiological context that more closely resembles the in vivo environment.


NEW METHOD
We developed a simple method to culture nodose ganglia neurons from neonatal pigs long-term in ex vivo format using an in-house media formulation derived from commercially available components.


RESULTS
Ganglia were cultured for six and twelve months. mRNA expression of nestin was stable across time. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and tachykinin showed statistically insignificant increases and decreases in mRNA expression, respectively. mRNA expression of glia fibrillary acidic protein decreased, whereas myelin basic protein showed no statistically significant differences, over time. Immunofluorescence studies of sectioned ganglia demonstrated neurofilament-positive cell bodies, glia fibrillary acidic protein and myelin basic protein at all time points. A significant decrease in cell nuclei density and fragmented DNA were noted.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S)
There are currently no methods that describe short-term or long-term culturing of porcine nodose ganglia. Further, the media formulation we developed is new and not previously reported.


CONCLUSIONS
The simple procedure we developed for culturing nodose ganglia will enable both short-term and long-term investigations aimed at understanding peripheral ganglia in vitro.

446,Kamil Sebastian Rosiewicz,"BACKGROUND
Molecular analyses of cell populations and single cells have been instrumental in the advancement of our understanding of the physiology and pathologic processes of the nervous system. However, the limitation of these methods is the dependence on a gentle, efficient and specific enrichment procedure for the target cell population. In particular, this has been challenging for tightly interconnected cells, for example central nervous system (CNS) endogenous cells such as astrocytes.


NEW METHOD
Here we adopted one of the most common methods of cell extraction, namely, enzymatic tissue digestion followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of individual cells. We evaluated different enzymatic/mechanical tissue dissociation procedures and analyzed different astrocyte lineage transgenic models. Furthermore, we compared the cell extraction efficiency from spinal cord vs. brain.


RESULTS
Enzymatic digestion of CNS tissue of Glast-CreERT2xtdTomatofl/fl or Aldh-CreERT2xtdTomatofl/fl followed by FACS resulted in highly purified astrocytes. Automated tissue digestion strongly improved the isolated cell numbers. Aldh1l1-CreERT2 identified more astrocytes than Glast-CreERT2; isolation from brain yields higher numbers than from spinal cord.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS
We compared the efficiency and purity of the enzymatic dissociation/FACS approach with a more modern procedure consisting of tissue homogenization followed by translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP).


CONCLUSION
We found that both methods result in highly enriched astrocytic RNA. However, only TRAP isolation resulted in reliably detectable RNA concentrations from spinal cord tissue on a single animal level. Depending on the aim of the study both methods have advantages and disadvantages but both are acceptable for astrocytic RNA analysis.",Tadhg Crowley;Gesine Saher;Janis Kerkering;Marlen Alisch;Volker Siffrin
447,Fang Wang,"How and when top-down information modulates visual-orthographic processing is an essential question in reading research. In a previous study, we showed that task modulation of print-tuning started at around 170 ms after stimulus presentation in the N1 offset of the ERP, while the N1 onset was yet unaffected. Here we test how prior category-level expectation affects visual-orthographic processing. Familiar, left/right-structured Chinese characters and stroke number matched, unfamiliar Korean characters were presented, while expectation about the upcoming stimuli was manipulated with green and blue colored frames (high Chinese vs. high Korean expectation). EEG data of 18 native Chinese speakers were recorded while participants performed an expectation judgment task. Results from occipito-temporal and whole map analyses revealed that effects of prior expectation changed throughout the N1. Accordingly in the N1 onset, a print tuning main effect was found, with a stronger N1 to Chinese characters than Korean characters, irrespective of expectation. In the N1 offset, an expectation-by-character interaction was observed at the whole map level, with a more negative N1 to Korean characters than Chinese characters when expecting a Chinese character, but no such difference when expecting a Korean character. Moreover, the expectation-by-character interaction continued to the N250, with similar responses to Chinese and Korean characters under the Chinese expectation condition, while less negative N250 to Korean than Chinese under the Korean expectation condition. Taken together, the current study provides evidence that prior category-level expectation starts to take effect at an early stage even within 200 ms by facilitating the processing of expected stimuli, suggesting that category-level expectation can influence early visual-orthographic processing during word recognition.",Urs Maurer
448,Nyssa Z Bulkes,"We investigated the role that semantic constraint and participant control over stimulus presentation have on early stages of visual word recognition. Namely, we tested how the presence of a highly constraining sentential context influences the expectations that readers have during incremental sentence processing. Further, we tested whether allowing participants to self-pace the experiment affected early sensory perceptions of written stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in three experiments. Participants read sentences containing a target word from one of four conditions: 1) the target, spelled as expected; 2) the target with two internal characters transposed; 3) a nonword one vowel different from a target; or 4) an illegal consonant string. In Experiment 1, sentences were minimally constraining up to the target word (average cloze at target word: 0.01); in Experiments 2 and 3, sentences were highly constraining (average cloze at target word: 0.93). In both Experiments 1 and 2, sentences were presented using rapid-serial-visual presentation (RSVP). In Experiment 3, participants saw the same sentences used in Experiment 2 but were allowed to self-pace the presentation of each word in every trial. In Experiments 1 and 2, results showed early neural sensitivity to nonsensical consonant strings only, and only when they appeared within high constraint. In Experiment 3, results showed graded N170 effects to all target words containing unexpected visual information. P600 modulations were observed in all three experiments, indexing the difficulty of processing unexpected orthography, particularly in downstream, integrative processing. Results support a nuanced view of early visual processing, namely one arguing that visual processing is more fine-grained the more control participants have over how they read.",Kiel Christianson;Darren Tanner
449,Xiaoyu Liu,"Both language experience and processing strategy have been found to affect functional lateralization of the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT). In this study, we adopted a factorial design to investigate the effects of language experience and processing strategy on functional lateralization of different vOT subregions in the processing of familiar (Chinese characters) and unfamiliar characters (Korean Hangul characters) in logographic writings. The processing strategy was manipulated by using part- and whole-based judgement tasks to induce part- and whole-based processing, respectively. The results showed that language experience enhanced neural responses in the anterior and middle vOT subregions, whereas part-based processing enhanced neural activations in the middle and posterior vOT subregions. More importantly, increased neural activations in the left hemisphere induced by language experience and part-based processing resulted in left laterality of the anterior and posterior vOT subregions, respectively, in the processing of logographic characters. These results suggested that functional lateralization of the anterior and posterior vOT subregions were respectively affected by language experience and processing strategy.",Qiulan Wu;Kangli Ying;Aqian Li;Yue Sun;Leilei Mei
450,Corey B Puryear,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome involving distinct pathological processes. Core features of MDD include anhedonia, reduced motivation, increased anxiety, negative affective bias, cognitive impairments, and dysregulated neuroplasticity mechanisms. There are multiple biological hypotheses related to MDD, including dysfunction of the opioid system. Although opium was abandoned as an antidepressant after the introduction of monoaminergic drugs, there has been renewed interest in targeting the opioid system for MDD. In this review, we discuss the preclinical support of this idea using a neurocircuitry- and molecular neuroplasticity-based approach. This article highlights how the opioid system potently modulates mesolimbic circuitry underlying motivation and reward processing, limbic circuitry underlying fear and anxiety responses, cortical and hippocampal circuitry underlying a variety of cognitive functions, as well as broad functional and structural plasticity mechanisms.

452,Aleya A Marzuki,"To-date it has been difficult to ascertain the exact cognitive profile of childhood OCD as studies report variable results. Adult OCD research lately utilises the endophenotype approach; studying cognitive traits that are present in both patients and their unaffected first-degree relatives, and are thought to lie closer to the genotype than the full-blown disorder. By observing whether candidate endopenotypes of adult OCD are present in child patients, we can determine whether the two subtypes show cognitive overlap. We conducted a systematic review of the paediatric OCD literature focussing on proposed neurocognitive endophenotypes of OCD: cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, memory, planning, decision-making, action monitoring, and reversal learning. We found that paediatric patients present robust increases in brain error related negativity associated with abnormal action monitoring, impaired decision-making under uncertainty, planning, and visual working memory, but there is less evidence for deficits in other cognitive domains. This implies that children with OCD show some cognitive similarities with adult patients, but other dysfunctions may only manifest later in the disorder trajectory.",Ana Maria Frota Lisboa Pereira de Souza;Barbara J Sahakian;Trevor W Robbins
453,Xiao Huan,"Cerebral ischemia is one of leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Stem cell-based therapy is promising some valuable strategies for the structural and functional recovery after ischemic insult. The inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) has wide spectrum neuroprotective properties by stimulating proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs). However, the potential role of PDE9 on NSCs proliferation after cerebral ischemia is not well investigated. The present study aimed to assess the contribution of PDE9 inhibition on the proliferation of NSCs and to determine the details of its underlying mechanisms against cerebral ischemia. The survival and proliferation of NSCs were assessed by CCK-8 assay and BrdU immunofluorescence staining, respectively. PDE9 activity and cGMP level were measured by ELISA kits. The protein expression of PKG and BDNF was detected by Western blot. Exposing NSCs of cultured primary hippocampus to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) significantly decreased the survival rate, but increased the proliferation of NSCs. Meanwhile, PDE9 activity was decreased, cGMP level was increased, PKG and BDNF protein expression was increased. PF-04447953, a PDE9 inhibitor, increased the survival rate of NSCs, moreover, PDE9 activity reduced more, and NSCs proliferation, cGMP level, PKG and BDNF protein expression were increased further, compared with OGD/R model group. These effects of PF-04447953, except for PDE9 activity and cGMP level, were reversed by treatment with KT5823, a PKG inhibitor. Taken together, the inhibition of PDE9 can promote the proliferation of NSCs following OGD/R injury, which may be, at least partly, mediated by cGMP-PKG pathway.",Cheng Oumei;Qiu Hongmei;Yang Junxia;Ma Xiaojiao;Jiang Qingsong
454,Irene E Zohn,"How genes and environment interact to cause birth defects is not well understood but key to developing new strategies to modify risk. The threshold model has been proposed to represent this complex interaction. This model stipulates that while environmental exposure or genetic mutation alone may not result in a defect, factors in combination increase phenotypic variability resulting in more individuals crossing the disease threshold where birth defects manifest. Many environmental factors that contribute to birth defects induce widespread cellular stress and misfolding of proteins. Yet, the impact of the stress response on the threshold model is not typically considered in discephering the etiology of birth defects. This mini-review will explore a potential mechanism for gene-environment interactions co-opted from studies of evolution. This model stipulates that heat shock proteins that mediate the stress response induced by environmental factors influence the number of individuals that cross disease thresholds resulting in increased incidence of birth defects. Studies in the field of evolutionary biology have demonstrated that heat shock proteins and Hsp90 in particular provide a link between environmental stress, genotype and phenotype. Hsp90 is a highly expressed molecular chaperone that assists a wide variety of protein clients with folding and conformational changes needed for proper function. Hsp90 also chaperones client proteins with potentially deleterious amino acid changes to suppress variation caused by genetic mutations. However, upon exposure to stress, Hsp90 abandons its normal physiological clients and is diverted to assist with the misfolded protein response. This can impact the activity of signaling pathways that involve Hsp90 clients as well as unmasking suppressed protein variation, essentially creating complex traits in a single step. In this capacity Hsp90 acts as an evolutionary capacitor allowing stored variation to accumulate and then become expressed in times of stress. This mechanism provides a substrate which natural selection can act upon at the population level allowing survival of the species with selective pressure. However, at the level of the individual, this mechanism can result in simultaneous expression of deleterious variants as well as reduced activity of a variety of Hsp90 chaperoned pathways and potentially shift phenotypic variability over the disease threshold resulting in birth defects.",
455,Robert A Brown,"In conventional non-quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, image contrast is consistent within images, but absolute intensity can vary arbitrarily between scans. For quantitative analysis of intensity data, images are typically normalized to a consistent reference. The most convenient reference is a tissue that is always present in the image, and is unlikely to be affected by pathological processes. In multiple sclerosis neuroimaging, both the white and gray matter are affected, so normalization techniques that depend on brain tissue may introduce bias or remove biological changes of interest. We introduce a complementary procedure, image ""calibration,"" the goal of which is to remove technical intensity artifacts while preserving biological differences. We demonstrate a deep learning approach to segmenting fat from within the orbit of the eyes on T1-weighted images at 1.5 and 3 T to use as a reference tissue, and use it to calibrate 1018 scans from 256 participants in a study of pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis. The machine segmentations agreed with the adjudicating expert (DF) segmentations better than did those of other expert humans, and calibration resulted in better agreement with semi-quantitative magnetization transfer ratio imaging than did normalization with the WhiteStripe1 algorithm. We suggest that our method addresses two key priorities in the field: (1) it provides a robust option for serial calibration of conventional scans, allowing comparison of disease change in persons imaged at multiple time points in their disease; and (ii) the technique is fast, as the deep learning segmentation takes only 0.5 s/scan, which is feasible for both large and small datasets.",Dumitru Fetco;Robert Fratila;Giulia Fadda;Shangge Jiang;Nuha M Alkhawajah;E Ann Yeh;Brenda Banwell;Amit Bar-Or;Douglas L Arnold; 
456,Pasquale Cardellicchio,"Action Execution (AE) and Action Observation (AO) share an extended cortical network of activated areas. During coordinative action these processes also overlap in time, potentially giving rise to behavioral interference effects. The neurophysiological mechanisms subtending the interaction between concurrent AE and AO are substantially unknown. To assess the effect of AO on observer's corticomotor drive, we run one electromyography (EMG) and three Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) studies. Participants were requested to maintain a steady hand opening or closing posture while observing the same or a different action (hand opening and closing in the main TMS study). By measuring Cortical Silent Periods (CSP), an index of GABAB-mediated corticospinal inhibitory strength, we show a selective reduction of inhibitory motor drive for mismatching AE-AO pairs. The last two TMS experiments, show that this mismatch is computed according to a muscle-level agonist-antagonist representation. Combined, our results suggest that corticospinal inhibition may be the central neurophysiological mechanism by which one's own motor execution is adapted to the contextual visual cues provided by other's actions.",Elisa Dolfini;Pauline M Hilt;Luciano Fadiga;Alessandro D'Ausilio
457,Luca Battaglini,"Visual crowding is the inability to discriminate objects when presented with nearby flankers and sets a fundamental limit for conscious perception. Beta oscillations in the parietal cortex were found to be associated to crowding, with higher beta amplitude related to better crowding resilience. An open question is whether beta activity directly and selectively modulates crowding. We employed transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in the beta band (18-Hz), in the alpha band (10-Hz) or in a sham regime, asking whether 18-Hz tACS would selectively improve the perception of crowded stimuli by increasing parietal beta activity. Resting electroencephalography (EEG) was measured before and after stimulation to test the influence of tACS on endogenous oscillations. Consistently with our predictions, we found that 18-Hz tACS, as compared to 10-Hz tACS and sham stimulation, reduced crowding. This improvement was found specifically in the contralateral visual hemifield and was accompanied by an increased amplitude of EEG beta oscillations, confirming an effect on endogenous brain rhythms. These results support a causal relationship between parietal beta oscillations and visual crowding and provide new insights into the precise oscillatory mechanisms involved in human vision.",Andrea Ghiani;Clara Casco;Luca Ronconi
458,Tahereh S Zarghami,"Metastability is a key source of itinerant dynamics in the brain; namely, spontaneous spatiotemporal reorganization of neuronal activity. This itinerancy has been the focus of numerous dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analyses - developed to characterize the formation and dissolution of distributed functional patterns over time, using resting state fMRI. However, aside from technical and practical controversies, these approaches cannot recover the neuronal mechanisms that underwrite itinerant (e.g., metastable) dynamics-due to their descriptive, model-free nature. We argue that effective connectivity (EC) analyses are more apt for investigating the neuronal basis of metastability. To this end, we appeal to biologically-grounded models (i.e., dynamic causal modelling, DCM) and dynamical systems theory (i.e., heteroclinic sequential dynamics) to create a probabilistic, generative model of haemodynamic fluctuations. This model generates trajectories in the parametric space of EC modes (i.e., states of connectivity) that characterize functional brain architectures. In brief, it extends an established spectral DCM, to generate functional connectivity data features that change over time. This foundational paper tries to establish the model's face validity by simulating non-stationary fMRI time series and recovering key model parameters (i.e., transition probabilities among connectivity states and the parametric nature of these states) using variational Bayes. These data are further characterized using Bayesian model comparison (within and between subjects). Finally, we consider practical issues that attend applications and extensions of this scheme. Importantly, the scheme operates within a generic Bayesian framework - that can be adapted to study metastability and itinerant dynamics in any non-stationary time series.",Karl J Friston
459,Roey Schurr,"The association fibers of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) connect parietal and frontal cortical regions in the human brain. The SLF comprises of three distinct sub-bundles, each presenting a different anatomical trajectory, and specific functional roles. Nevertheless, in vivo studies of the SLF often consider the entire SLF complex as a single entity. In this work, we suggest a data-driven approach that relies on microstructure measurements for separating SLF-III from the rest of the SLF. We apply the SLF-III separation procedure in three independent datasets using parameters of diffusion MRI (fractional anisotropy), as well as relaxometry-based parameters (T1, T2, T2* and T2-weighted/T1-weighted). We show that the proposed procedure is reproducible across datasets and tractography algorithms. Finally, we suggest that differential crossing with different white-matter tracts is the source of the distinct MRI signatures of SLF-II and SLF-III.",Ady Zelman;Aviv A Mezer

We use this dataset and multi-atlas-based image processing methods to obtain a hierarchical partition of the brain from larger anatomical regions to individual cortical and deep structures and derive age trends of brain structure through the lifespan (3-96 years old). Critically, we present and validate a methodology for harmonizing this pooled dataset in the presence of nonlinear age trends.

461,Hanna Yousuf,"Experience-dependent neuronal plasticity is a fundamental substrate of learning and memory. Intrinsic excitability is a form of neuronal plasticity that can be altered by learning and indicates the pattern of neuronal responding to external stimuli (e.g. a learning or synaptic event). Associative fear conditioning is one form of learning that alters intrinsic excitability, reflecting an experience-dependent change in neuronal function. After fear conditioning, intrinsic excitability changes are evident in brain regions that are a critical part of the fear circuit, including the amygdala, hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and prefrontal cortex. Some of these changes are transient and/or reversed by extinction as well as learning-specific (i.e. they are not observed in neurons from control animals). This review will explore how intrinsic neuronal excitability changes within brain structures that are critical for fear learning, and it will also discuss evidence promoting intrinsic excitability as a vital mechanism of associative fear memories. This work has raised interesting questions regarding the role of fear learning in changes of intrinsic excitability within specific subpopulations of neurons, including those that express immediate early genes and thus demonstrate experience-dependent activity, as well as in neurons classified as having a specific firing type (e.g. burst-spiking vs. regular-spiking). These findings have interesting implications for how intrinsic excitability can serve as a neural substrate of learning and memory, and suggest that intrinsic plasticity within specific subpopulations of neurons may promote consolidation of the memory trace in a flexible and efficient manner.",Vanessa L Ehlers;Megha Sehgal;Chenghui Song;James R Moyer

Heclin improved short-term memory, consolidation, retrieval, and reconsolidation when administered immediately post training, prior to testing, or after memory reactivation, respectively. In addition, it impaired memory extinction when administered prior to a long reactivation session. Heclin infusion was also tested for locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior in a circular arena, but no effect was seen.

463,Pravesh S Gadjradj,"OBJECTIVE
Historically, women were underrepresented in the field of medicine. Nowadays the underrepresentation is more applicable to surgical disciplines. Many efforts have been made to decrease the attrition rate of women in the neurosurgical field and to even career opportunities to be comparable to those of male colleagues. It is unclear, however, if gender disparities occur nowadays between female and male neurosurgeons. Therefore the aim of the current study is to identify gender differences in the professional and private life's of neurosurgeons.


METHODS
A survey consisting of 38 questions was sent to members of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons regarding demographics, career fulfillment, private life and parenting. Comparison between female and male respondents were made.


RESULTS
870 members filled in surveys, which were analyzed. Working full-time, days worked weekly and gross salary did not differ between male and female neurosurgeons. Female neurosurgeons, however, rated their career fulfillment worse than male neurosurgeons (p<0.001), and were less likely to choose a career as neurosurgeon again (p<0.001). Furthermore, female neurosurgeons were less likely to be married or to have children than male colleagues (p<0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Despite efforts to increase the amount of women enrolling into neurosurgery and despite efforts to strive for equality, the results of the current study show gender disparities in the professional and private careers among neurosurgeons. Practice patterns did not differ between male and female neurosurgeons, but perceptions on career and characteristics of the private life did. Program directors and chairs should focus on measurements to decrease gender differences and to strive for equal career satisfaction among female and male neurosurgeons.",Roshni H S Matawlie;Ishitari Voigt;Biswadjiet S Harhangi;Carmen L A M Vleggeert-Lankamp
464,Jeff Ehresman,"OBJECTIVE
Level I trauma centers use patient triaging systems to deploy neurosurgical resources and pursue good outcomes; however, data describing the effectiveness these triage systems are lacking. We reviewed the leveling protocol (cases designated urgent/emergent) of a regional Level I trauma center to obtain epidemiological data about the efficiency of that system and identify areas for improvement.


METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed leveled neurosurgical cases from January 2015-October 2017, assessing surgery date, neurosurgical procedure, posted surgical urgency level (Levels 1-3, with 1 being most urgent), and ""post-to-room time"" (ie, the time between initial leveling and admission of the patient to the operating room). Mean post-to-room times were compared between case types using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD analysis.


RESULTS
Of 1,469 cases, 577 (39.3%) were shunt placement/revision, 231 (15.7%) were craniectomy or craniotomy for hematoma, 147 (10.0%) were craniectomy or craniotomy for tumor, and 514 (35.0%) were for other indications. Among Level 1 cases, post-to-room time was lowest for craniotomies to evacuate intracranial hematoma (mean:16.2 minutes) and highest for spinal decompression procedures and wound washouts (mean: 36.2 and 42.4 minutes).


CONCLUSION
This is the first study of variability in post-to-room timing as a function of surgical urgency/indication. The most common leveled cases were craniectomies or craniotomies to relieve increased intracranial pressure, which were also the most common Level 1 cases. Significant variability occurred within each leveling category; thus, further investigation is required.",A Karim Ahmed;Daniel Lubelski;Zachary Pennington;Bowen Jiang;Corinna Zygourakis;Ethan Cottrill;Nicholas Theodore
465,Italo Di Pascuale,"BACKGROUND
Hypoglossal schwannomas are rare, benign intracranial neoplasms; they represent 5% of all non-vestibular schwannomas.


CLINICAL CASE
A 22-year-old male patient who presented 4 months prior to admission with left sided hearing loss, an increase in the base of support with lateralization to the left and dysphagia to solids. Physical examination on admission shows hypotrophy of the tongue and deviation to the left. Magnetic resonance imaging shows evidence of an extra axial lesion compressing the medulla oblongata and pons, that protrudes through the hypoglossal canal. Patient is planned for surgical treatment in two stages: in the first surgery, a left retrosigmoidal approach with total resection of the intracranial lesion was performed. The biopsy reported a schwannoma and correlating the signs, symptoms and imaging, the diagnosis of a hypoglossal nerve schwannoma was established. In the second surgery, a lateral cervical approach was performed, with subtotal resection of the lesion, leaving a remnant adhered to the nerve in the hypoglossal canal.

467,Siddharth Vankipuram,"OBJECTIVE
Primary decompressive craniectomy (DC) is indicated to evacuate the hematoma and reduce intracranial pressure in traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, there are a myriad of complications due to absence of the bone flap. A novel technique, four quadrant osteoplastic decompressive craniotomy (FoQOsD) retains the bone flap while achieving adequate cerebral decompression.


METHODS
A single center randomized controlled trial of 115 patients with TBI needing domcpressive surgery was conducted. Of them, 59 underwent DC and 56 underwent FoQOsD. The primary outcome determined was functional status at six months using Glasgow outcome scale extended (GOS-e).


RESULTS
No significant differences were identified in baseline characteristics between both groups. Mean GOS-e score was comparable at six months (4.28 in DC vs 4.38 in FoQOsD, p-value 0.856). Further, 22 of 58 patients in DC group had expired (38%) compared to 25 of 55 patients in FoQOsD group (44.6%), odds ratio 1.19 (95% CI 0.6 to 2.36), p = 0.6 (1 patient lost to follow up in each group). Favourable outcome was seen in 56.8% of patients in DC group vs 54.4% patients in FoQOsD group, p=0.74. Presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (OR 7.17, 95% CI 1.364-37.7; p-value 0.020), opposite side contusions (OR 3.838 95% CI 1.614-9.131; p-value 0.002) and anisocoria (OR 3.235, 95% CI 1.490-7.026; p-value 0.003) pre-operatively were individual factors that played a significant role in final outcome.

FoQOsD is as efficacious as conventional DC with the added benefit of avoiding a second surgery. The procedure is associated with better cosmesis and fewer complications.",Sumeet V Sasane;Anil Chandra;B K Ojha;Sunil K Singh;Chhitij Srivastava;Somil Jaiswal;Ankur Bajaj;Manish Jaiswal
468,Tommaso Ballarini,"OBJECTIVE
The clinical diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome (CBS) represents a challenge for physicians and reliable diagnostic imaging biomarkers would support the diagnostic work-up. We aimed to investigate the neural signatures of CBS using multimodal T1-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).


METHODS
Nineteen patients with CBS (age 67.0 ± 6.0 years; mean±SD) and 19 matched controls (66.5 ± 6.0) were enrolled from the German Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Consortium. Changes in functional connectivity and structure were respectively assessed with eigenvector centrality mapping complemented by seed-based analysis and with voxel-based morphometry. In addition to mass-univariate statistics, multivariate support vector machine (SVM) classification tested the potential of multimodal MRI to differentiate patients and controls. External validity of SVM was assessed on independent CBS data from the 4RTNI database.


RESULTS
A decrease in brain interconnectedness was observed in the right central operculum, middle temporal gyrus and posterior insula, while widespread connectivity increases were found in the anterior cingulum, medial superior-frontal gyrus and in the bilateral caudate nuclei. Severe and diffuse gray matter volume reduction, especially in the bilateral insula, putamen and thalamus, characterized CBS. SVM classification revealed that both connectivity (area under the curve 0.81) and structural abnormalities (0.80) distinguished CBS from controls, while their combination led to statistically non-significant improvement in discrimination power, questioning the additional value of functional connectivity over atrophy. SVM analyses based on structural MRI generalized moderately well to new data, which was decisively improved when guided by meta-analytically derived disease-specific regions-of-interest.

469,Makiko Kuwagata,"OBJECTIVE
Prenatal treatment of rats with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) is a neurodevelopmental model showing hyperactivity and impaired sexual activity. Human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, exhibit sex-related pathology, but sex-related neurodevelopment has not been fully investigated in this model. We conducted this study to facilitate the understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.


METHODS
Pregnant rats received 50 mg/kg BrdU on gestational days 9-15. The tissue content of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and their metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were measured in male and female offspring at 3 weeks (juveniles) and 10 weeks (adults) of age.


RESULTS
Prenatally BrdU-treated rats had reduced DA metabolism or DA content in the hypothalamus from the juvenile through the adult period without sex differences, but sex-specific striatal DA abnormalities emerged after maturation. A reduction in 5-HT metabolism was measured in the hypothalamus without sex differences throughout development. Developmental alterations in the striatal 5-HT states were sex-dependent. Temporal changes in DA or 5-HT metabolism were found in the frontal cortex and midbrain.


CONCLUSION
The sex-specific influence of a genotoxic factor on the development of the DA and 5-HT systems was clarified in the hypothalamus and striatum. The results suggest that the observed sex dependence and region specificity are related to the pathology of social dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders.",Katsumasa Muneoka;Kazuho Honda;Akira Miyazaki

Acromegaly is so rare that its natural history, including incidence, risk of cancers, and mortality rates remain elusive. This natural study utilized a nationwide database to provide a better understanding of acromegaly's disease course.


METHODS
A cohort of 1,195 acromegaly patients were identified and followed-up from 1997 to 2013. Incidence, operation, and re-operation rates were calculated. Excessive mortality and cancer risk related to acromegaly were estimated by standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and standardized incidence ratio (SIR).


RESULTS
The incidence was 2.78 per million-person-years, with little gender predominance (female vs male, 49.5% vs 50.5%, respectively). There was female predominance only among 50 and 60 year olds (incidence rate ratio: 1.37 and 1.43, p<0.001 and p=0.002). Among them, 673 (56.3%) had hypophysectomy surgery, and the young-onset (<40 years) patients had more re-operations (15.5%, p=0.01). The overall mortality rate was 22.3 per 1,000-person-years, with a median survival of 4.67 years (with no gender differences, p=0.38). The overall SMR of acromegaly patients was 1.41 and the onset-age-specific SMRs of the early- and middle-onset patients were higher than for those with late-onset. There were 87 newly-diagnosed cancers in the cohort, with an incidence rate of 10.6 per 1,000-person-years (median: 5.4 years). The overall SIR of cancers was 1.91, and there were no differences among gender, onset-age, and disease duration (all SIR>1, approximately 2).


CONCLUSION
Acromegaly is associated with an excessive risk of mortality and two-fold higher risk of cancers. Patients with acromegaly should be managed appropriately after the diagnosis.",Wen-Cheng Huang;Hsuan-Kan Chang;Chin-Chu Ko;Jiing-Feng Lirng;Yu-Chun Chen
471,Mine Benjamin,"INTRODUCTION
Stent-assisted coiling has widened indications and improved stability of endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. However, stent-assisted coiling is usually not used to treat acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms to avoid antiplatelet therapy. The objective of this study is to evaluate a strategy of staged endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms including coiling at the acute phase with complementary stenting with or without coiling at the subacute phase.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Between 2012 and 2017, we retrospectively identified, in our prospectively maintained database, all patients treated for a ruptured intracranial aneurysm based on this staged stenting strategy. Clinical charts and imaging follow-up were analyzed to assess the procedural safety and feasibility as well as clinical and anatomical outcome.


RESULTS
We identified 23 patients with 23 intracranial aneurysms including 15 (65.2%) women with a mean age of 50 years (range 24-69 years). No rebleeding occurred during the mean delay of 24.3 days between initial coiling and stenting. All procedures were successful and additional coiling was performed in 5/23 procedures (21.7%). Clinical status was unchanged in all patients. At follow-up, the modified Rankin scale was graded 0 in 19/23 (82.6%), 1 in 2/23 (8.7%), and 2 in 2/23 (8.7%) patients, respectively. The rate of complete occlusion rose from 30.4% before the stenting procedure to 52.2% immediately after and 72.7% at follow-up.


CONCLUSION
This strategy of early staged stenting in selected patients is safe and improves immediate intracranial aneurysm occlusion and long-term stability in this population at high risk of intracranial aneurysm recurrence with coiling alone.",Bonnet Thomas;Vazquez-Suarez Juan Carlos;Ligot Noémie;Lubicz Boris
472,Chenhao Zhang,"Background and Objective: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a serious condition that is often called a warning stroke. The risk of cerebral infarction in patients with TIA and positive DWI findings is greater than that in patients with TIA and normal DWI findings. Butylphthalide injection is a new type of brain protective drug. The study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of butylphthalide injection for treating TIA as shown by DWI abnormality progressing to infarction.Methods: We studied 98 patients with positive DWI findings among 260 patients with TIA, and randomly divided into the experimental (treatment with butylphthalide injection) and control (treatment with aspirin) groups. The number of cerebral infarctions in the two groups was recorded on 7th, 14th, 30th, and 90th day, and adverse reactions were observed. The number of cerebral infarctions was compared among the different ABCD2 scores of patients with TIA and positive DWI findings.Results: The incidence of cerebral infarction in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of cerebral infarction with an ABCD2 score less than 3 points was significantly lower than that with an ABCD2 score of more than 3 points (P < 0.05), with less adverse reactions.Conclusion: Butylphthalide injection is helpful and safe for preventing stroke following TIA, and treating TIA with positive DWI and progression to infarction.",Yanjing Zang;Qin Song;Weidong Zhao;Hongxuan Li;Lei Hu;Qing Zhang;Fang Gu;Chunliang Zhang
473,B Ikenberg,"BACKGROUND
Repeated mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke treatment in individual patients has been proven feasible. However, less is known about the etiology of recurrent vessel occlusions after prior thrombectomy. We aimed to understand if the etiology of such recurrent events differs from the first stroke.


METHODS
Retrospectively, we identified all patients at our center who received a repeated mechanical thrombectomy between 2007 and 2019. Clinical data were retrieved from medical records. Etiology of stroke was evaluated retrospectively, and angiographic studies were revisited.


RESULTS
Twenty-three patients (1.5%) were identified. Median age was 68 years (IQR 56-77). Median NIHSS at first admission was 11 points (IQR 5-15). In nine cases (39.1%), the recurrent vessel occlusion was located exactly at the same position as the prior occlusion. Overall, five (21.7%) patients had a remarkable extracranial pathology as likely cause of stroke recurrence. In 16 patients (69.6%), the etiology of the first stroke and its recurrence was considered as likely being the same, mostly of cardioembolic or unknown origin. In the seven remaining patients (30.4%), the cause of stroke possibly differed from the first event, with five patients (21.7%) having a postinterventional intracranial intimal lesion as possible cause of stroke.


CONCLUSION
Incidence of repeated thrombectomy was low. However, the high number of patients with known origin of stroke etiology raises the question how their monitoring may be optimized. The number of patients with remarkable extracranial pathologies or intracranial endothelial lesions supports current clinical practice to pay attention to final angiographic series.",J Rösler;C L Seifert;S Wunderlich;J Kaesmacher;C Zimmer;T Boeckh-Behrens;B Friedrich;C Maegerlein
474,Jyoti Panwar,"The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of structural lesions on conventional MRI of the brain in a large prospective cohort of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) patients. Conventional 3T MRI was used to evaluate 127 prospectively enrolled PCS patients and 29 controls for non-specific white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and traumatic structural lesions including encephalomalacia, atrophy, microhemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and cortical siderosis. All PCS patients had the clinical diagnosis of one or more concussions based on the Concussion in Sport Group (CISG) consensus statements. Patients with recognized intracranial hemorrhage on prior head CT and MRI were excluded. The differences between the PCS and control groups were analyzed. Four patients in the PCS group (3.1%) had positive findings which included microhemorrhages in two patients and encephalomalacia in another two patients. None of these lesions was present in the control group but there was no statistical difference between the two groups (P = 0.5 for microhemorrhage and P = 0.5 for encephalomalacia). In the PCS group, 28 patients (22%) had WMH (15.7% had 1-10 lesions and 6.3% had > 10 lesions), and these results did not differ from the age-matched control (20.6%, all with =1-10 lesions), P =0.9. The location of the WMH showed no significant difference in the number of juxtacortical WMH between the PCS and control groups (P = 0.5). Structural lesions were rare in PCS in this study and the presence of such findings suggests a more severe form of traumatic brain injury. Our data support the role for MRI in the diagnosis of PCS by exclusion of atrophy, encephalomalacia and all forms of intracranial hemorrhage. The presence of WMH irrespective of number is not an exclusion. This is the first description of the MRI criteria for PCS.

Patients with complex cerebral aneurysms can now be treated intravascularly with the help of flow-diverting stents. The primary purpose of this article is to document the clinical and angiographic outcomes in 80 patients who were treated with the Pipeline flow-diverting stent (PFS; Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) and the obliteration mechanism was discussed.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Between October 2015 and October 2019, 80 patients with 90 complex (undefined neck, large/giant, blood blister-like, and recurrent side-wall) cerebral aneurysms treated with the PFS were retrospectively reviewed. Forty-five patients were women and 35 were men, with a mean age of 52 years. Large or giant aneurysms were defined as 10 mm or larger and small aneurysms were defined as less than 10 mm at the largest diameter measured on angiogram.


RESULTS
Forty-one aneurysms (45.6%) were large or giant, 41 (45.6%) were small, four (4.4%) were recurrent side-wall aneurysms and four (4.4%) were blood blister-like aneurysms. In total, 87 PFSs were placed in 80 patients with 90 aneurysms. In six patients, coexisting proximal stenosis of parent artery was also covered with PFS without balloon angioplasty. Adjunct coils were placed in 31 aneurysms (34%). One patient died of intracerebral hematoma after thrombolysis. There was one intrastent occlusion at six-month follow-up without any symptoms. The morbidity and the mortality rate is 0% and 1.3% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0%-3.7%). Control angiography was available in 74 (92.5%) patients with 83 aneurysms, and the aneurysm occlusion rate was 98.8% (95% CI, 96.5%-100%) in 6 to 12 months.

For wide-necked saccular, large/giant, blood blister-like aneurysms and recurrent side-wall aneurysms, PFS is a valid and safe treatment option.",Chuhan Jiang;Zhongxue Wu;Weijian Jiang;Guihuai Wang
476,Zahra Ofoghi,"Headaches and pain-related symptoms are the most disabling somatic complaints following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this study, we reviewed the existing literature examining structural differences in brain morphology and axonal connections, as well as functional differences in brain activity and connectivity associated with pain or post-traumatic headache following mTBI. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases for: 1) TBI, concussion or post-concussion syndrome, 2) pain or headache, and 3) magnetic resonance imaging, functional MRI or diffusion tensor imaging. Inclusion criteria were original studies written in English on participants with mTBI or concussion diagnosis with results reported on pain and/or headache. Exclusion criteria: Review papers, case studies, documentaries and studies related to moderate to severe TBI. Quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality assessment tool. Results: Nineteen out of 3439 studies satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants with pain-related symptoms had lower cortical thickness in frontal and parietal cortical areas and spinothalamic tract volume. Differences in axonal connectivity were displayed in the corpus callosum, spinothalamic tract, fornix-septohippocampal circuit, and periaqueductal gray. Less activation in pain-related regions during a heat-pain task-based fMRI was reported in participants with PTH. In conclusion, individuals with pain following mTBI display differences in brain structure and brain function suggesting irregularities in descending pain modulatory system. These findings primarily provide information on neuroimaging differences in adults; there is limited research in pediatric populations.",Deborah Dewey;Karen Maria Barlow
477,S García-Herranz,"The main objetive was to analyze the accuracy of different verbal fluency tests (VFTs) in discriminating cognitively healthy subjects from individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a cohort of older Spanish speaking adults. As a result, we aimed to identify the VFT that best predicts conversion from MCI to probable AD. 287 subjects: 170 controls (HC), 90 stable MCI and 27 patients with MCI that evolved into probable AD (MCI-AD) were assessed with a neuropsychological battery test and five VFTs. The animal fluency test produced the best differentiation of HC from MCI (p < .001), of HC from MCI-AD (p < .001) and of MCI from MCI-AD converters (p < .001), with sensitivities 98.8%, 98.8% and 75.6%, respectively. Logistic regression showed that the animal fluency test (p < 0.001) appears to be the most useful and neuropsychological VFT to predict conversion to probable dementia.",M C Díaz-Mardomingo;C Venero;H Peraita
478,Fátima Rivera-Escalera,"BACKGROUND
Neuroinflammation is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet numerous studies have demonstrated a beneficial role for neuroinflammation in amyloid plaque clearance. We have previously shown that sustained expression of IL-1β in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice decreases amyloid plaque burden independent of recruited CCR2+ myeloid cells, suggesting resident microglia as the main phagocytic effectors of IL-1β-induced plaque clearance. To date, however, the mechanisms of IL-1β-induced plaque clearance remain poorly understood.


METHODS
To determine whether microglia are involved in IL-1β-induced plaque clearance, APP/PS1 mice induced to express mature human IL-1β in the hippocampus via adenoviral transduction were treated with the Aβ fluorescent probe methoxy-X04 (MX04) and microglial internalization of fibrillar Aβ (fAβ) was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. To assess microglial proliferation, APP/PS1 mice transduced with IL-1β or control were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU and hippocampal tissue was analyzed by flow cytometry. RNAseq analysis was conducted on microglia FACS sorted from the hippocampus of control or IL-1β-treated APP/PS1 mice. These microglia were also sorted based on MX04 labeling (MX04+ and MX04- microglia).


RESULTS
Resident microglia (CD45loCD11b+) constituted > 70% of the MX04+ cells in both Phe- and IL-1β-treated conditions, and < 15% of MX04+ cells were recruited myeloid cells (CD45hiCD11b+). However, IL-1β treatment did not augment the percentage of MX04+ microglia nor the quantity of fAβ internalized by individual microglia. Instead, IL-1β increased the total number of MX04+ microglia in the hippocampus due to IL-1β-induced proliferation. In addition, transcriptomic analyses revealed that IL-1β treatment was associated with large-scale changes in the expression of genes related to immune responses, proliferation, and cytokine signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
These studies show that IL-1β overexpression early in amyloid pathogenesis induces a change in the microglial gene expression profile and an expansion of microglial cells that facilitates Aβ plaque clearance.",Jonathan J Pinney;Laura Owlett;Hoda Ahmed;Juilee Thakar;John A Olschowka;Michael R Elliott;M Kerry O'Banion

To compare the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of published versus sample-based norms to detect early dementia in the Uniform Data Set (UDS).


METHODS
The UDS was administered to 526 nondemented participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Baseline scores were standardized using published norms and healthy control data from ADNI corrected for age, education, and sex. Subjects obtaining two scores < -1 SD (determined separately using published and sample norms) were labeled ""at risk for dementia."" Both methods were compared on sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV) for dementia at follow-up.


RESULTS
Risk scores derived from published data had 86.1% sensitivity, 62.0% specificity, 68.6% accuracy, 46.1% PPV, and 92.2% NPV. Those from sample norms were more sensitive (91.0%), less specific (52.9%), and less accurate (63.3%), with worse PPV (42.1%) and similar NPV (94.0%). Sample norms were better at identifying incident dementia cases with relatively lower education than those with higher education. Discrepancies between both methods were more common in women.


CONCLUSIONS
Sample norms are marginally more sensitive than published norms for predicting dementia, while published norms are slightly more accurate. Accuracy of risk estimates for women and those with lower education may be increased using locally generated norms.",

To examine the contributions of two aspects of executive functioning (executive cognitive functions and behavioral control) to changes in diabetes management across emerging adulthood.


METHODS
Two hundred and forty-seven high school seniors with type 1 diabetes were assessed at baseline and followed up for 3 years. The baseline assessment battery included performance-based measures of executive cognitive functions, behavioral control, IQ estimate (IQ-est), and psychomotor speed; self-report of adherence to diabetes regimen; and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) assay kits as a reflection of glycemic control.


RESULTS
Linear and quadratic growth curve models were used to simultaneously examine baseline performance on four cognitive variables (executive cognitive functions, behavioral control, IQ, and psychomotor speed) as predictors of indices of diabetes management (HbA1c and adherence) across four time points. Additionally, general linear regressions examined relative contributions of each cognitive variable at individual time points. The results showed that higher behavioral control at baseline was related to lower (better) HbA1c levels across all four time points. In contrast, executive cognitive functions at baseline were related to HbA1c trajectories, accounting for increasingly more HbA1c variance over time with increasing transition to independence. IQ-est was not related to HbA1c levels or changes over time, but accounted instead for HbA1c variance at baseline (while teens were still living at home), above and beyond all other variables. Cognition was unrelated to adherence.

Different aspects of cognition play a different role in diabetes management at different time points during emerging adulthood years.",Jonathan Butner;Deborah J Wiebe;MaryJane Campbell;Sara L Turner;Cynthia A Berg

RESULTS
Women had better verbal memory, men had better visuospatial function. There was no interaction between sex, diagnostic group, and/or time (4-year follow-up period).

482,Janet M Duchek,"OBJECTIVES
The present study explored relationships among personality, Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, and dementia by addressing the following questions: (1) Does personality discriminate healthy aging and earliest detectable stage of AD? (2) Does personality predict conversion from healthy aging to early-stage AD? (3) Do AD biomarkers mediate any observed relationships between personality and dementia status/conversion?


METHODS
Both self- and informant ratings of personality were obtained in a large well-characterized longitudinal sample of cognitively normal older adults (N = 436) and individuals with early-stage dementia (N = 74). Biomarkers included amyloid imaging, hippocampal volume, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42, and CSF tau.


RESULTS
Higher neuroticism, lower conscientiousness, along with all four biomarkers strongly discriminated cognitively normal controls from early-stage AD individuals. The direct effects of neuroticism and conscientiousness were only mediated by hippocampal volume. Conscientiousness along with all biomarkers predicted conversion from healthy aging to early-stage AD; however, none of the biomarkers mediated the relationship between conscientiousness and conversion. Conscientiousness predicted conversion as strongly as the biomarkers, with the exception of hippocampal volume.


CONCLUSIONS
Conscientiousness and to a lesser extent neuroticism serve as important independent behavioral markers for AD risk.",Andrew J Aschenbrenner;Anne M Fagan;Tammie L S Benzinger;John C Morris;David A Balota

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit impaired semantic and socioemotional processes, which are thought to be related to dysfunctions in the fronto-striatal circuit. However, little is known about how the memory enhancement by these processes was reduced in PD. The present study investigated this issue.


METHODS
The retrieval performance of face memories encoded by semantic and socioemotional processes was compared between 24 PD patients and 24 age-matched healthy controls (HC). During encoding, participants were presented with unfamiliar faces and made judgment about them in three encoding conditions of semantic judgment (Semantics), attractiveness judgment (Attractiveness), and form judgment (Form). In Semantics, participants rated to what degree each face looked like an office worker, whereas in Attractiveness, participants rated how attractive each face was. The Form condition as a control required participants to judge the shape of each face. During retrieval after encoding, participants made old or new judgment for target and distracter faces.


RESULTS
In HC, the retrieval of faces encoded by Semantics and Attractiveness was significantly more accurate than that encoded by Form, whereas this memory enhancement was not identified in PD. In addition, individual scores in frontal lobe function and long-term memory correlated with the retrieval performance of memories encoded in Semantics and Attractiveness but not Form.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that the processing of semantic and socioemotional signals conveyed from faces could be impaired in PD and that the impairment of these processes could decrease the enhancement of face memories by semantic and socioemotional elaborations.",Hodaka Yamakado;Ryosuke Takahashi;Shikiho Dote;Shiho Ubukata;Toshiya Murai;Takashi Tsukiura

To develop and validate the Discrepancy-based Evidence for Loss of Thinking Abilities (DELTA) score. The DELTA score characterizes the strength of evidence for cognitive decline on a continuous spectrum using well-established psychometric principles for improving detection of cognitive changes.


METHODS
DELTA score development used neuropsychological test scores from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (two tests each from Memory, Executive Function, and Language domains). We derived regression-based normative reference scores using age, gender, years of education, and word-reading ability from robust cognitively normal ADNI participants. Discrepancies between predicted and observed scores were used for calculating the DELTA score (range 0-15). We validated DELTA scores primarily against longitudinal Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) scores (baseline assessment through Year 3) using linear mixed models and secondarily against cross-sectional Alzheimer's biomarkers.


RESULTS
There were 1359 ADNI participants with calculable baseline DELTA scores (age 73.7 ± 7.1 years, 55.4% female, 100% white/Caucasian). Higher baseline DELTA scores (stronger evidence of cognitive decline) predicted higher baseline CDR-SOB (ΔR2 = .318) and faster rates of CDR-SOB increase over time (ΔR2 = .209). Longitudinal changes in DELTA scores tracked closely and in the same direction as CDR-SOB scores (fixed and random effects of mean + mean-centered DELTA, ΔR2 > .7). Results were similar for FAQ scores. High DELTA scores predicted higher PET-Aβ SUVr (ρ = 324), higher CSF-pTau/CSF-Aβ ratio (ρ = .460), and demonstrated PPV > .9 for positive Alzheimer's disease biomarker classification.

Data support initial development and validation of the DELTA score through its associations with longitudinal functional changes and Alzheimer's biomarkers.

485,Coco O Bernard,"OBJECTIVES
Whether mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) sustained by children results in persistent or recurrent symptoms, over and above those experienced by children who solely sustain mild extracranial injuries, remains debated. The current prospective longitudinal case-controlled study aimed to examine the relative influence of injury and noninjury factors on symptoms in preschool and primary school-aged children who sustained an mTBI or mild extracranial injury at least 8 month earlier.


METHODS
Participants were 64 parents of children (31 mTBI, 33 trauma controls) who sustained injury between ages 2 and 12, whose postconcussive symptoms across the first 3-month postinjury have been previously described. The current study assessed postconcussive symptoms at 8 or more months postinjury (M = 24.3, SD = 8.4) and examined a range of injury and noninjury predictive factors.


RESULTS
At or beyond 8-month postinjury, symptom numbers in the mTBI group were comparable with those of the group who sustained mild extracranial injury. Educational attainment of parents (below or above high-school attainment level) was the only predictor of symptoms at follow-up, with preexisting learning difficulties approaching significance as a predictor.


CONCLUSIONS
While our earlier study found that mTBI was associated with symptoms at 3-month postinjury, follow-up at more than 8 months showed mTBI no longer predicted symptom reporting. While mTBI contributes significantly to the presence of symptoms in the first few months postinjury, researchers and healthcare practitioners in this field need to consider the potential impact of noninjury factors on persistent or recurrent symptoms after mTBI.",Audrey McKinlay;David Krieser;Jennie L Ponsford
486,Giorgia Cona,"OBJECTIVE
This study explored mental rotation (MR) performance in patients with myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1), an inherited neuromuscular disorder dominated by muscular symptoms, including muscle weakness and myotonia. The aim of the study was twofold: to gain new insights into the neurocognitive mechanisms of MR and to better clarify the cognitive profile of DM1 patients. To address these aims, we used MR tasks involving kinds of stimuli that varied for the extent to which they emphasized motor simulation and activation of body representations (body parts) versus visuospatial imagery (abstract objects). We hypothesized that, if peripheral sensorimotor feedback system plays a pivotal role in modulating MR performance, then DM1 patients would exhibit more difficulties in mentally rotating hand stimuli than abstract objects.


METHOD
Twenty-four DM1 patients and twenty-four age- and education-matched control subjects were enrolled in the study and were required to perform two computerized MR tasks involving pictures of hands and abstract objects.


RESULTS
The analysis of accuracy showed that patients had impaired MR performance when the angular disparities between the stimuli were higher. Notably, as compared to controls, patients showed slower responses when the stimuli were hands, whereas no significant differences when stimuli were objects.


CONCLUSION
The findings are coherent with the embodied cognition view, indicating a tight relation between body- and motor-related processes and MR. They suggest that peripheral, muscular, abnormalities in DM1 lead to alterations in manipulation of motor representations, which in turn affect MR, especially when body parts are to mentally rotate.",Arianna Casagrande;Sabrina Lenzoni;Elena Pegoraro;Virginia Bozzoni;Luca Bello;Gianni Sorarù;Annalisa Botta;Carlo Semenza
487,Patricia Sulzer,"OBJECTIVES
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) have an increased risk of developing dementia (PDD). As activities of daily living (ADL) impairment is mandatory for the diagnosis of PDD, assessing early signs of instrumental ADL (iADL) dysfunction, especially in PD-MCI, is essential. In PD, self- and caregiver-reported iADL performance is often confounded by motor dysfunction and mood. Objective and time-efficient performance-based measurements are needed to screen for cognitive-related iADL dysfunction. We evaluated the Erlangen Test of Activities of Daily Living in Mild Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (ETAM) in PD and determined its value for characterizing a subgroup of PD-MCI patients with mild performance-based iADL impairment.


METHODS
Twenty-one cognitively normal PD patients (PD-NC), 24 PD-MCI patients, and 18 healthy controls (HC) were analyzed. Assessments included the ETAM, a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, iADL, mood, and motor measurements.


RESULTS
PD-MCI patients scored significantly lower on the ETAM total score compared to PD-NC patients (p = .002), whereas HC and PD-NC patients did not statistically differ. No HC scored lower than 27 points (diagnostic cutoff for mild iADL impairment); only PD-MCI patients scored below this cutoff (29.2%) suggesting the ETAM is able to characterize a PD-MCI subgroup with early iADL impairment. PD-MCI patients below the cutoff were more impaired in the attention domain (p = .04).


CONCLUSIONS
The ETAM is a potentially valuable clinical assessment, able to detect first signs of iADL dysfunction in PD-MCI. Further studies in larger cohorts are needed to evaluate the prognostic ability for predicting PDD.",Alena Bäumer;Huong Giang Hoang;Sara Becker;Hannah Dorothea Lönneker;Elmar Graessel;Inga Liepelt-Scarfone
488,M Alejandra Infante,"OBJECTIVES
Alcohol and cannabis remain the substances most widely used by adolescents. Better understanding of the dynamic relationship between trajectories of substance use in relation to neuropsychological functioning is needed. The aim of this study was to examine the different impacts of within- and between-person changes in alcohol and cannabis use on neuropsychological functioning over multiple time points.


METHODS
Hierarchical linear modeling examined the effects of alcohol and cannabis use on neuropsychological functioning over the course of 14 years in a sample of 175 adolescents (aged 12-15 years at baseline).


RESULTS
Time-specific fluctuations in alcohol use (within-person effect) predicted worse performance across time on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Block Design subtest (B = -.05, SE = .02, p = .01). Greater mean levels of percent days of cannabis use across time (between-person effect) were associated with an increased contrast score between Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color Word Inhibition and Color Naming conditions (B = .52, SE = .14, p < .0001) and poorer performance over time on Block Design (B = -.08, SE = .04, p = .03). Neither alcohol and/nor cannabis use over time was associated with performance in the verbal memory and processing speed domains.


CONCLUSIONS
Greater cumulative cannabis use over adolescence may be linked to poorer inhibitory control and visuospatial functioning performance, whereas more proximal increases in alcohol consumption during adolescence may drive alcohol-related performance decrements in visuospatial functioning. Results from this prospective study add to the growing body of literature on the impact of alcohol and cannabis use on cognition from adolescent to young adulthood.",Tam T Nguyen-Louie;Matthew Worley;Kelly E Courtney;Clarisa Coronado;Joanna Jacobus

Magnetic resonance imaging, nerve conduction studies, and electromyography were performed, and a diagnosis of left sciatic neuropathy proximal to the branch to the biceps femoris muscle was made. After 3 months, her motor weakness and paresthesia resolved spontaneously.

490,Qingyuan Fan,"Neurofibrillary tangles likely cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We demonstrate that the CX3CL1 C-terminal domain can upregulate neurogenesis, which may ameliorate neurodegeneration. Here we generated transgenic (Tg-CX3CL1) mice by overexpressing CX3CL1 in neurons. Tg-CX3CL1 mice exhibit enhanced neurogenesis in both subgranular and subventricular zones. This enhanced neurogenesis correlates well with elevated expression of TGFβ2, TGFβ3 and activation of their downstream signaling molecule Smad2. Intriguingly, the enhanced adult neurogenesis was mitigated when Smad2 expression was deleted in neurons, supporting a role for the CX3CL1-TGFβ2/3-Smad2 pathway in the control of adult neurogenesis. When Tg-CX3CL1 mice were crossed with Alzheimer's PS19 mice, which overexpress a tau P301S mutation and exhibit age-dependent neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration, overexpressed CX3CL1 in both male and female mice was sufficient to rescue the neurodegeneration, increase survival time, and improve cognitive function. Hence, we provide in vivo evidence that CX3CL1 is a strong activator of adult neurogenesis, reduces neuronal loss, and improves cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.Significance Statement: This study will be the first to demonstrate the enhanced neurogenesis by overexpressed CX3CL1 is mitigated by disruption of Smad2 signaling and independent of its interaction with CX3CR1. Overexpression of CX3CL1 lengthens the lifespan of PS19 tau mice by enhancing adult neurogenesis while having minimal effect on tau pathology. Enhancing neuronal CX3CL1, mainly the C-terminal fragment, is a therapeutic strategy for blocking or reversing neuronal loss in Alzheimer's or related neurodegenerative disease patients.",Wanxia He;Manoshi Gayen;Marc Robert Benoit;Xiaoyang Luo;Xiangyou Hu;Riqiang Yan
491,Daniel Sanculi,"We discovered a new type of dendritic spine. It is found on space-specific neurons in the barn owl inferior colliculus, a site of experience-dependent plasticity. Connectomic analysis revealed dendritic protrusions of unusual morphology including topological holes, hence termed 'toric' spines (n = 76). More significantly, presynaptic terminals converging onto individual toric spines displayed numerous active zones (up to 49) derived from multiple axons (up to 11) with incoming trajectories distributed widely throughout 3D space. This arrangement is suited to integrate input sources. Dense reconstruction of two toric spines revealed that they were unconnected with the majority (∼84%) of intertwined axons, implying a high capacity for information storage. We developed an ex vivo slice preparation and provide the first published data on space-specific neuron intrinsic properties, including cellular subtypes with and without toric-like spines. We propose that toric spines are a cellular locus of sensory integration and behavioral learning.Significance statement The majority of excitatory synapses in the brain are formed onto dendritic spines, which typically act to isolate the action of individual synapses. We discovered a new type of spine which in contrast receives convergent input from many different axons. These 'toric' spines, named for their topological holes, are found on space-specific neurons in the barn owl auditory system. We used a combination of in vivo electrophysiology, super-resolution optical microscopy and serial block electron microscopy to characterize the ultrastructure and wiring of toric spines, and ex vivo patch clamp recording to elucidate the cells' electrical properties.

We compared evoked cortical activity in mice expressing three ChR variants with distinct temporal profiles under the CamKII promoter: Chronos, Chrimson, and ChR2. We assessed overall neural activation by measuring the amplitude and temporal progression of evoked spiking. Using gamma-range (30-80Hz) LFP power as an assay for local network engagement, we examined the recruitment of cortical network activity by each tool. All variants caused light-evoked increases in firing in vivo, but each demonstrated different temporal patterning of evoked activity. In addition, the three ChRs had distinct effects on cortical gamma-band activity. Our findings suggest the properties of optogenetic tools can substantially affect their efficacy in vivo, as well their engagement of circuit resonance.Significance statement Genetically modified opsins are some of the most widely used experimental tools in modern neuroscience. However, although these tools are well characterized at the single-cell level, little is known about how the varying properties of the opsins affect their interactions with active neural networks in vivo Here we present data from experiments using three optogenetic tools with distinct activation/inactivation and kinetic profiles. We find that opsin properties regulate the amplitude and temporal pattern of activity evoked in vivo Despite all evoking elevated spiking, the three opsins also differentially regulate cortical gamma oscillations. These data suggest that the kinetic properties of optogenetic tools interact with active neural circuits on several time scales. Optogenetic tool selection should therefore be a key element of experimental design.",Jessica A Cardin
493,Ming Yang,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the interaction effect of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity on the efficacy and safety of dual/single antiplatelet therapy in patients with and without intracranial arterial stenosis (ICAS) by the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events trial.


METHODS
Patients with both MRI analysis and Lp-PLA2 testing results were included in the current subanalysis. The interaction of Lp-PLA2 activity with the effects of dual and single antiplatelet therapy were analyzed through Cox proportional hazards regressions model.


RESULTS
Among the 797 patients, the mean age was 63.1 ± 10.8 years, 518 (65%) were men, 356 (44.7%) had ICAS, and 441 (55.3%) did not. There were significantly more patients with elevated Lp-PLA2 activity in the ICAS group than in the non-ICAS group (43.8% vs 35.4%, p = 0.02). There was significant interaction between Lp-PLA2 activity levels and the 2 antiplatelet therapies for prevention of stroke recurrences and combined vascular events even after adjustment for confounding factors exclusively for patients with ICAS (p = 0.017, 0.017, respectively), but not for those without (p = 0.332, 0.674, respectively). Compared with aspirin alone, dual antiplatelet therapy significantly reduced the risk of stroke recurrences and combined vascular events (adjusted hazard ratio 0.33 [0.12-0.89], p = 0.028; 0.33 [0.12-0.89], p = 0.028, respectively) for patients with ICAS and nonelevated Lp-PLA2 activity.


CONCLUSIONS
Presence of both ICAS and nonelevated Lp-PLA2 activity may predict better response to dual antiplatelet therapy in prevention of recurrent strokes and combined vascular events for patients with minor stroke or high-risk TIA.

494,Cyndya A Shibao,"OBJECTIVE
Cytochrome b561 (CYB561) generates ascorbic acid, a cofactor in the enzymatic conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine by dopamine β-hydroxylase. We propose that the clinical relevance of this pathway can be revealed by characterizing the autonomic and biochemical characteristics of patients with CYB561 mutations.


METHODS
We performed autonomic evaluations in 4 patients with lifelong orthostatic hypotension in whom CYB561 mutations were determined by genomic sequencing.


RESULTS
Patients had disabling lifelong orthostatic hypotension (OH) and impaired blood pressure response to the Valsalva maneuver (VM), with exaggerated hypotension during phase 2 and lack of overshoot during phase 4. Heart rate ratios for sinus arrhythmia and the VM were normal. Plasma norepinephrine and metabolites were undetectable, and plasma dopamine and metabolites were normal. Droxidopa restored norepinephrine levels and improved OH. Patients 1 and 2 were sisters and homozygous for a nonsense mutation in exon 2, c.131G>A, p.Trp44 (Circ Res 2018). Their brother (patient 3) died at age 16 and his DNA was not available. Patient 4 was compound heterozygous; one allele had a missense mutation in exon 2, c157C>T, p.His.53Tyr, and the other had an exon 2 deletion.


CONCLUSION
CYB561 deficiency is characterized by selective sympathetic noradrenergic failure with lifelong, disabling OH but with normal sympathetic cholinergic (sweating) and parasympathetic (heart rate regulation) functions. We report a novel case of CYB561 deficiency due to an exon 2 deletion in one allele and a missense mutation in the other.

495,Mohammad Mahdi Shiraz Bhurwani,"BACKGROUND
Angiographic parametric imaging (API), based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA), is a quantitative imaging tool that may be used to extract contrast flow parameters related to hemodynamic conditions in abnormal pathologies such as intracranial aneurysms (IAs).


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the feasibility of using deep neural networks (DNNs) and API to predict IA occlusion using pre- and post-intervention DSAs.


METHODS
We analyzed DSA images of IAs pre- and post-treatment to extract API parameters in the IA dome and the corresponding main artery (un-normalized data). We implemented a two-step correction to account for injection variability (normalized data) and projection foreshortening (relative data). A DNN was trained to predict a binary IA occlusion outcome: occluded/unoccluded. Network performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and classification accuracy. To evaluate the effect of the proposed corrections, prediction accuracy analysis was performed after each normalization step.


RESULTS
The study included 190 IAs. The mean and median duration between treatment and follow-up was 9.8 and 8.0 months, respectively. For the un-normalized, normalized, and relative subgroups, the DNN average prediction accuracies for IA occlusion were 62.5% (95% CI 60.5% to 64.4%), 70.8% (95% CI 68.2% to 73.4%), and 77.9% (95% CI 76.2% to 79.6%).

496,Ming-Ge Li,"PURPOSE
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is commonly observed in Parkinson's disease (PD), even in the early stages. However, the neural substrates of cognitive impairment in PD remain unclear. The aim of the current study was to investigate the change of local brain function in PD patients with MCI.


METHODS
Fifty patients with PD, including 25 PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI) and 25 PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC), and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3D structural images, and resting state-functional MRI (rs-fMRI) were performed in all subjects. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was measured based on the rs-fMRI images to investigate the altered local brain functions.


RESULTS
Brain regions with decreased ReHo were located in the left posterior cerebellar lobe in PD sub-groups compared to the HC group, and the brain regions with increased ReHo were located in the limbic lobe (right precuneus/bilateral middle cingulate cortex) in PD-MCI compared with HC group. PD-MCI presented with increased ReHo in the bilateral precuneus/left superior parietal lobe and decreased ReHo in the left insula compared to PD-NC.

497,F Runck,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The number of acute and early stent occlusions after emergency stenting of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in patients with tandem lesions is unclear and only mentioned in a small number of publications, ranging from 0-20%. A recent article by Yilmaz et al. reported a high rate of acute in-stent occlusions of 45% within 72 h after deployment of CASPER dual layer stents.


METHODS
All patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with a CASPER stent between August 2014 and April 2018 were retrospectively evaluated for occlusion rates, periinterventional medication and early complications. A total of 66 patients, 45 with tandem pathologies and 21 with proximal ICA stenosis only were enrolled.


RESULTS
Thrombotic complications occurred in 16 out of 66 patients (24%) and hemorrhagic complications in 8/66 (12%) and 15 of the 16 thrombotic complications and 7/8 symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages (sICH) occurred in patients with tandem lesions and accessory intracranial thrombectomy. Of the patients with sICH five were treated in a prolonged or unknown time window. In patients with intraprocedural thrombotic complications ultrasound imaging showed patent stents in 13 of the 14 patients CONCLUSIONS: The CASPER stent system showed a high technical success rate in patients with acute stroke. The number of patients with sICH was not higher than the numbers reported in the published literature despite the early use of Gp IIb/IIIA inhibitors, whereas the number of thrombotic complications was smaller than that reported in recent studies. The majority of sICH occurred in patients treated because of tandem lesions in an unknown or prolonged time window.",C J Maurer;A Berlis
498,Feng-Xiang Wang,"BACKGROUND
Brain tumors cause significant morbidity and mortality due to rapid progression and high recurrence risks. Reliable biomarkers to improve diagnosis thereof are desirable.


OBJECTIVE
This work aimed to identify panels of biomarkers for diagnostic purposes using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based metabolomics.


METHODS
A cohort of 163 histologically-proven patients with brain disorders was involved. Comprehensive CSF-based metabolomics was achieved by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight spectrometric (LC-Q/TOF-MS) and multivariate statistical analyses. The diagnostic performance of the metabolic markers was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves.


RESULTS
A total of 508 ion features were detected by the LC-Q/TOF-MS analysis, of which 27 metabolites were selected as diagnostic markers to discriminate different brain tumor types. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.91 for lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastases (MBT) vs. lung adenocarcinoma patients without brain metastases (NMBT), 0.83 for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) vs. secondary central nervous system involvement of systemic lymphoma (SCNSL), 0.77 for PCNSL vs. MBT, 0.87 for SCNSL vs. MBT, 0.86 for MBT vs. nontumorous brain diseases (NT), and 0.80 for PCNSL vs. NT. Perturbed metabolic pathways between the comparisons related mainly to amino acids and citrate metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
CSF-based metabolomics to a large extent reliably identifies significant metabolic differences between different brain tumors and shows great potential for diagnosis of brain tumors.",Kun Chen;Feng-Qing Huang;Raphael N Alolga;Jingjing Ma;Zi-Xuan Wu;Yuanming Fan;Gaoxiang Ma;Ming Guan
499,Manon Thierry,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), Tau and Aβ aggregates involve sequentially connected regions, sometimes distantly separated. These alterations were studied in the pillar of the fornix (PoF), an axonal tract, to analyse the role of axons in their propagation. The PoF axons mainly originate from the subicular neurons and project to the mamillary body. Forty-seven post-mortem cases at various Braak stages (Tau) and Thal phases (Aβ) were analysed by immunohistochemistry. The distribution of the lesions showed that the subiculum was affected before the mamillary body, but neither Tau aggregation nor Aβ deposition was consistently first. The subiculum and the mamillary body contained Gallyas positive neurofibrillary tangles, immunolabelled by AT8, TG3, PHF1, Alz50 and C3 Tau antibodies. In the PoF, only thin and fragmented threads were observed, exclusively in the cases with neurofibrillary tangles in the subiculum. The threads were made of Gallyas negative, AT8 and TG3 positive Tau. They were intra-axonal and devoid of paired helical filaments at electron microscopy. We tested PoF homogenates containing Tau AT8 positive axons in a Tau P301S biosensor HEK cell line and found a seeding activity. There was no Aβ immunoreactivity detected in the PoF. We could follow microcryodissected AT8 positive axons entering the mamillary body; contacts between Tau positive endings and Aβ positive diffuse or focal deposits were observed in CLARITY-cleared mamillary body. In conclusion, we show that non-fibrillary, hyperphosphorylated Tau is transported by the axons of the PoF from the subiculum to the mamillary body and has a seeding activity. Either Tau aggregation or Aβ accumulation may occur first in this system: this inconstant order is incompatible with a cause-and-effects relationship. However, both pathologies were correlated and intimately associated, indicating an interaction of the two processes, once initiated.",Susana Boluda;Benoît Delatour;Serge Marty;Danielle Seilhean; ;Marie-Claude Potier;Charles Duyckaerts
500,Loranzie S Rogers,"Many aquatic organisms use vocalizations for reproductive behavior; therefore, disruption of their soundscape could adversely affect their life history. Male oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) establish nests in shallow waters during spring and attract female fish with boatwhistle vocalizations. Males exhibit high nest fidelity, making them susceptible to anthropogenic sound in coastal waters, which could mask their vocalizations and/or reduce auditory sensitivity levels. Additionally, the effect of self-generated boatwhistles on toadfish auditory sensitivity has yet to be addressed. To investigate the effect of sound exposure on toadfish auditory sensitivity, sound pressure and particle acceleration sensitivity curves were determined using auditory evoked potentials before and after (0-, 1-, 3-, 6- and 9-day) exposure to 1- or 12-h of continuous playbacks to ship engine sound or conspecific vocalization. Exposure to boatwhistles had no effect on auditory sensitivity. However, exposure to anthropogenic sound caused significant decreases in auditory sensitivity for at least 3 days, with shifts up to 8 dB SPL and 20 dB SPL immediately following 1- and 12-h anthropogenic exposure, respectively. Understanding the effect of self-generated and anthropogenic sound exposure on auditory sensitivity provides an insight into how soundscapes affect acoustic communication.",Rosalyn L Putland;Allen F Mensinger
501,Burak Gür,"The computational organization of sensory systems depends on the diversification of individual cell types with distinct signal-processing capabilities. The Drosophila visual system, for instance, splits information into channels with different temporal properties directly downstream of photoreceptors in the first-order interneurons of the OFF pathway, L2 and L3. However, the biophysical mechanisms that determine this specialization are largely unknown. Here, we show that the voltage-gated Ka channels Shaker and Shal contribute to the response properties of the major OFF pathway input L2. L3 calcium response kinetics postsynaptic to photoreceptors resemble the sustained calcium signals of photoreceptors, whereas L2 neurons decay transiently. Based on a cell-type-specific RNA-seq data set and endogenous protein tagging, we identified Shaker and Shal as the primary candidates to shape L2 responses. Using in vivo two-photon imaging of L2 calcium signals in combination with pharmacological and genetic perturbations of these Ka channels, we show that the wild-type Shaker and Shal function is to enhance L2 responses and cell-autonomously sharpen L2 kinetics. Our results reveal a role for Ka channels in determining the signal-processing characteristics of a specific cell type in the visual system.",Katja Sporar;Anne Lopez-Behling;Marion Silies

503,Kyu-Chang Wang,"INTRODUCTION
Junctional neural tube defect (JNTD) is a recently introduced form of congenital spinal dysraphism that is characterized by functional disconnection between the primary and secondary neural tubes. The upper and lower cords appeared to be connected by a non-functioning band-like structure. JNTD is suspected to arise from a developmental error not corresponding to either primary or secondary neurulation, but rather between the two neurulation processes. On the other hand, segmental spinal dysgenesis (SSD) is an older entity of spinal anomalies in which a segment of the spine and spinal cord does not develop properly. The anomaly had been noted for the bony abnormality, as it is the most prominent feature. Based on the recent encounter of two cases resembling both entities, we sought the possibility that the two diseases may have the same pathoembryogenesis.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Based on the impression that the two entities share important features, we compared the details of the two anomalies. First, our two recently encountered cases of JNTD were described. Second, previous reports of SSD were comprehensively reviewed. The two cases had the essential anomaly of the neural structures satisfying the definition of JNTD, as well as the elaborate spinal deformity as seen in SSD. In the previous literature on SSD, it was recognized that in addition to the bone anomaly, disconnected spinal cord was present. Hence, the two entities seem to have many similar clinical and neuroimaging features. The dysgenic spinal level is similar, and the disconnection between the primary and secondary neural tubes is found in the two diseases. The two neural tubes are connected by a band-like structure, with severe stenosis of the spinal canal at the level of the band. Both entities show segmental anomalies of the vertebrae in the thoracolumbar region, especially in the posterior element. Although the extent of shared features seems high, the previously suggested hypothetical pathoembryogenesis of SSD did not involve the process of junctional neurulation. We suggest that SSD shares the same origin as JNTD, and the bony abnormality may be a secondary phenomenon to the core error during neural tube development.


CONCLUSIONS
We propose that JNTD and SSD may be the same entity, originating from an error during junctional neurulation. As there is controversy regarding the treatment strategy for both entities, unified accumulation of clinical experience and analysis may help improve the management of patients.",Jong Seok Lee;Keewon Kim;Young Jae Im;Kwanjin Park;Kyung Hyun Kim;Ji Hoon Phi;Seung-Ki Kim;Ji Yeoun Lee
504,Anastasia Bougea,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the possible association between salivary CRP, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels, depression/anxiety and migraine, and tension type headache (TTH) in saliva of these patients.


METHOD
A longitudinal prospective study was conducted on 30 migraineurs, 30 TTH patients, and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Anxiety and depression were measured by using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Salivary IL-6, IL-1β, and CRP were collected in distinct time points as A: headache-free period, B: during headache, C: 1 day after headache attack, and measured by using ELISA kits.


RESULTS
No significant differences were found in time variation of CRP, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels between migraine and TTH (p > 0.05). IL1-β had the highest discriminative value (area under the curve = 0.924, p value < 0.001), and then CRP (area under the curve = 0.763, p value < 0.001) and IL-6 (area under the curve = 0.537, p value = 0.58). CRP and IL-6 were negatively correlated with HAM-A and BDI scores.


CONCLUSION
IL1-β had the highest discriminative value between headache patients and controls compared with CRP and IL-6. CRP and IL-6 were correlated with lower symptom scores of anxiety and depression prior or immediately after the headache period in patients groups.",Nikolaos Spantideas;Petros Galanis;Paraskevi Katsika;Fotini Boufidou;Panagiota Voskou;Ioannis Vamvakaris;Evangelos Anagnostou;Xrysa Nikolaou;Evangelia Kararizou

506,Zhengguo Qiu,"Neuroinflammation is critical in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Microglial pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) status determines the outcome of neuroinflammation. Dexmedetomidine exerts anti-inflammatory effects in many neurological conditions. Whether dexmedetomidine functions via modulation of microglia M1/M2 polarization remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of dexmedetomidine on the neuroinflammatory cell model and explored the potential mechanism. BV2 cells were stimulated with LPS to establish a neuroinflammatory model. The cell viability was determined with MTT assay. NO levels were assessed using a NO detection kit. The protein levels of IL-10, TNF-α, iNOS, CD206, ERK1/2, and pERK1/2 were quantified using Western blotting. LPS significantly increased pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and NO, and M1 phenotypic marker iNOS, and decreased anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 and M2 phenotypic marker CD206 in BV2 cells. Furthermore, exposure of BV2 cells to LPS significantly raised pERK1/2 expression. Pretreatment with dexmedetomidine attenuated LPS-elicited changes in p-ERK, iNOS, TNF-α, NO, CD206 and IL-10 levels in BV2 cells. However, co-treatment with dexmedetomidine and LM22B-10, an agonist of ERK, reversed dexmedetomidine-elicited changes in p-ERK, iNOS, TNF-α, NO, CD206 and IL-10 levels in LPS-exposed BV2 cells. We, for the first time, showed that dexmedetomidine increases microglial M2 polarization by inhibiting phosphorylation of ERK1/2, by which it exerts anti-inflammatory effects in BV2 cells.",Pan Lu;Kui Wang;Xijuan Zhao;Qianqian Li;Jieqiong Wen;Hong Zhang;Rong Li;Haidong Wei;Yuying Lv;Shuyue Zhang;Pengbo Zhang

Evolution of endoscopic surgery provides equivalent results to open surgery with advantages of minimal invasive surgery. The literature on technique Uniportal Full endoscopic contralateral approach is scarce.


METHODS
The endoscopic contralateral approach technique applies for patients presenting with double crush syndrome with foraminal and extraforminal stenosis. The key steps focus on contralateral ventral overriding superior articular process decompression, foraminal and extraforaminal discectomy, and lateral vertebral syndesmophyte decompression leading to enlargement of the contralateral foramen and extraforamen size.

The Uniportal Full endoscopic contralateral approach is a good alternative to open surgery or minimally invasive microscopic surgery through direct endoscopic visualization of the entire route of exiting nerve with no neural retraction allowing both lateral recess and foraminal and extraforaminal decompression all in one approach.",Hyeun Sung Kim;Il-Tae Jang
508,Ann-Katrin Ohlerth,"BACKGROUND
Protocols for intraoperative language mapping with direct electrical stimulation (DES) often include various language tasks triggering both nouns and verbs in sentences. Such protocols are not readily available for navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), where only single word object naming is generally used. Here, we present the development, norming, and standardization of the verb and noun test for peri-operative testing (VAN-POP) that measures language skills more extensively.


METHODS
The VAN-POP tests noun and verb retrieval in sentence context. Items are marked and balanced for several linguistic factors known to influence word retrieval. The VAN-POP was administered in English, German, and Dutch under conditions that are used for nTMS and DES paradigms. For each language, 30 speakers were tested.

511,Ming-Wei Lin,"Despite Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, no FDA-approved disease-modifying treatments have been approved for this condition since 2003. Neuronal-type alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) play an essential role in cognitive functions, binding with extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ plaques) and inhibiting Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. α7nAChRs are impaired early in the course of AD; drugs targeting α7nAChRs are being hotly pursued as a treatment of AD. Encenicline, a partial selective agonist of α7nAChR and modulator of acetylcholine, failed in phase III trials because of gastrointestinal side effects. We, therefore, evaluated the efficacy of galantamine, a positive allosteric modulator at α7nAChRs and an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, that has been used since 2000 as first-line treatment of mild-to-moderate dementia. This study highlights an important new benefit with galantamine. We found that galantamine inhibits Aβ1-42-induced apoptosis by activating the JNK signaling pathway, thus enhancing α7nAChR expression, and also inhibits the Akt pathway, which further increases autophagosome biogenesis and autophagy. These effects can be reproduced by α7nAChR overexpression in the absence of galantamine. Importantly, the α7 subunit protein sequence of α7nAChRs contains 3 LC3-interacting regions; our immunoprecipitation data show that α7 binds with the autophagosomal marker protein LC3. This is the first report to provide evidence showing that the cell surface receptor α7nAChR acts as a cargo carrier for LC3 binding for Aβ1-42 sequestration to autophagosomes, suggesting a novel mechanism for the neuroprotective efficacy of galantamine in AD.",Yi-Hung Chen;Han-Ben Yang;Chi Chien Lin;Shih-Ya Hung
512,Lauren R Schaff,"PURPOSE
Understanding the molecular landscape of glioblastoma (GBM) is increasingly important in the age of targeted therapy. O-6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and EGFR amplification are markers that may play a role in prognostication, treatment, and/or clinical trial eligibility. Quantification of MGMT and EGFR protein expression may offer an alternative strategy towards understanding GBM. Here, we quantify baseline expression of MGMT and EGFR protein in newly diagnosed GBM samples using mass spectrometry. We correlate findings with MGMT methylation and EGFR amplification statuses and survival.


METHODS
We retrospectively identified adult patients with newly diagnosed resected GBM. MGMT and EGFR protein expression were quantified using a selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry assay. Protein levels were correlated with MGMT methylation and EGFR amplification and survival data.


RESULTS
We found a statistically significant association between MGMT protein expression and promoter methylation status (p = 0.02) as well as between EGFR protein expression and EGFR amplification (p < 0.0001). EGFR protein expression and amplification were more tightly associated than MGMT protein expression and methylation. Only MGMT promoter methylation was statistically significantly associated with progression-free and overall survival.


CONCLUSIONS
Unlike EGFR protein expression and EGFR amplification which are strongly associated, only a weak association was seen between MGMT protein expression and promoter methylation. Quantification of MGMT protein expression was inferior to MGMT methylation for prognostication in GBM. Discordance was observed between EGFR amplification and EGFR protein expression; additional study is warranted to determine whether EGFR protein expression is a better biomarker than EGFR amplification for clinical decisions and trial enrollment.",Dongyao Yan;Sheeno Thyparambil;Yuan Tian;Fabiola Cecchi;Marc Rosenblum;Anne S Reiner;Katherine S Panageas;Todd Hembrough;Andrew L Lin

514,Emilio Garro-Martínez,"We previously reported that the inactivation (cKO) or the stabilization (cST) of β-catenin in cells expressing the astrocyte-specific glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) is associated with the vulnerability or resilience to exhibit anxious/depressive-like behaviors, respectively, and to changes in hippocampal proliferation. Here, we used these cKO and cST β-catenin mice to study the serotonergic system functionality associated with their behavioral/molecular phenotype. The activity of 5-HT1A receptors was assessed by (+)-8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia and [35S]GTPγS binding autoradiography. The animals' response to acute stress and the levels of extracellular serotonin (5-HT) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were also assessed. cKO mice presented higher 5-HT1A autoreceptor functionality, lower 5-HT1A heteroreceptor functionality, and a decrease in extracellular 5-HT levels in the mPFC. These neurochemical changes were accompanied with a blunted physiological response to stress-induced hyperthermia. In contrast, cST mice showed a reduced 5-HT1A autoreceptor functionality and higher extracellular 5-HT levels in the mPFC after fluoxetine administration. Moreover, cST mice subjected to chronic corticosterone administration did not show a blunted response to fluoxetine. Our findings suggest the existence of a link between β-catenin levels and 5-HT1A receptor functionality, which may be relevant to understand the neurobiological bases underlying the vulnerability or resilience to stress-related disorders.",Rebeca Vidal;Albert Adell;Álvaro Díaz;Elena Castro;Josep Amigó;Raquel Gutiérrez-Lanza;Eva Florensa-Zanuy;Laura Gómez-Acero;M Mark Taketo;Ángel Pazos;Fuencisla Pilar-Cuéllar

516,Ewa Kozela,"Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic cannabinoid, demonstrates antipsychotic-like and procognitive activities in humans and in animal models of schizophrenia. The mechanisms of these beneficial effects of CBD are unknown. Here, we examined behavioral effects of CBD in a pharmacological model of schizophrenia-like cognitive deficits induced by repeated ketamine (KET) administration. In parallel, we assessed transcriptional changes behind CBD activities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the main brain area linked to schizophrenia-like pathologies. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected for 10 days with KET followed by 6 days of CBD. The cognitive performance was evaluated in the novel object recognition test followed by PFC dissections for next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis and bioinformatics. We observed that KET-induced learning deficits were rescued by CBD (7.5 mg/kg). Similarly, CBD reversed transcriptional changes induced by KET. The majority of the genes affected by KET and KET-CBD were allocated to astroglial and microglial cells and associated with immune-like processes mediating synaptogenesis and neuronal plasticity. These genes include C1qc, C1qa, C1qb, C2, and C3 complement cascade elements, Irf8 factor and Gpr84, Gpr34, Cx3cr1, P2ry12, and P2ry6 receptors. The main pathway regulators predicted to be involved included TGFβ1 and IFNγ. In addition, CBD itself upregulated oxytocin mRNA in the PFC.

517,Huoyin Zhang,"Previous research has revealed that interpersonal relationships and social comparisons play important roles in evaluating outcomes. To our knowledge, how interpersonal relationships influence the process of outcome evaluations in a social comparison context remains largely unclear. In the current study, participants engaged in a simple gambling task with an acquaintance or a stranger and received outcome feedback. Behavioral results showed that participants' satisfaction level was sensitive to the outcome of their fellow players when participants won. In this condition, the satisfaction level was greater when their fellow players won rather than lost. Moreover, the satisfaction level was greater when their friends won compared with when a stranger won. Event-related potential (ERP) results showed that when participants won, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) was more negative going for other's losses than for other's gains. Moreover, the FRN was also more negative going for a stranger's gains than a friend's gains. In contrast, in the self-loss condition, the FRN was more negative going for other's gains than for other's losses regardless of the type of interpersonal relationship. These FRN findings indicate that the experience of other's outcomes is sensitive to participants' own outcomes. Importantly, the interpersonal relationship only showed its influence when both the self and others received monetary gains. Finally, the P300 registered participants' attention resource allocation toward monetary gains for themselves and for others, which was unaffected by the interpersonal relationship. This work reveals that outcome evaluation in various social comparison contexts is sensitive to the difference in interpersonal relationship in its early stage, labeled by the FRN.",Mingming Zhang;Jiachen Lu;Lili Zhao;Dongfang Zhao;Chuan Xiao;Ruolei Gu;Wenbo Luo
518,Saumitra Sen Singh,"Different animal and human studies from last two decades in the case of Parkinson's disease (PD) have concentrated on oxidative stress due to increased inflammation and cytokine-dependent neurotoxicity leading to induction of dopaminergic (DA) degeneration pathway in the nigrostriatal region. Chronic inflammation, the principle hallmark of PD, forms the basis of neurodegeneration. Aging in association with activation of glia due to neuronal injury, perhaps because of immune alterations and genetic predispositions, leads to deregulation of inflammatory pathways premising the onset of PD. A family of inducible transcription factors, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), is found to show expression in various cells and tissues, such as microglia, neurons, and astrocytes which play an important role in activation and regulation of inflammatory intermediates during inflammation. Both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways are involved in the regulation of the stimulated cells. During the prodromal/asymptomatic stage of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., PD and AD), chronic neuroinflammation may act silently as the driver of neuronal dysfunction. Though research has provided an insight over age-related neurodegeneration in PD, elaborative role of NF-κB in neuroinflammation is yet to be completely understood and thus requires more investigation. Polyphenols, a group of naturally occurring compound in medicinal plants, have gained attention because of their anti-oxidative and anti-neuroinflammatory properties in neurodegenerative diseases. In this aspect, this review highlights the role of NF-κB and the possible therapeutic roles of polyphenols in NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation in PD.",Sachchida Nand Rai;Hareram Birla;Walia Zahra;Aaina Singh Rathore;Surya Pratap Singh
519,Fiona J M Tymm,"β-N-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a non-protein amino acid produced by cyanobacteria that can accumulate in ecosystems and food webs. Human exposure to cyanobacterial and algal blooms may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Analytical chemists have struggled to find reliable methods for BMAA analysis in complex sample matrices. Analysis of BMAA is complicated by at least 3 naturally occurring isomers: N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine (AEG), 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB), and β-aminomethyl-L-alanine (BAMA). More than 350 publications have reported detection and quantification of BMAA and its isomers, but varying results have led to controversy in the literature. The objective of this study was to perform a single laboratory validation (SLV) of a frequently published method for BMAA analysis using a ZIC-HILIC column. We investigated the selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of the method and our data show that this HILIC method fails many of the criteria for a validated method. The method fails the criterion for selectivity as the chromatography does not separate BMAA from its isomer BAMA. Sensitivity of the method greatly decreased over the experimental period and it demonstrated a higher limit of detection (LOD) (7.5 pg on column) and a higher lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) (30 pg on column) than other published validated methods. The method demonstrated poor precision of repeated injections of standards of BMAA with % relative standard deviation (%RSD) values that ranged from 37 to 107% while HorRat values for BMAA had a fail rate of 80% and BAMA had a fail rate of 73%. No HorRat values between 0.5 and 2 were found for repeated injections of standards of AEG and DAB. Recovery of 13C3,15N2-BMAA in a cyanobacterial matrix was < 10% in experiments and we were also unable to accurately detect other protein amino acids including methionine, cysteine, or alanine, indicating matrix effects. The results of this study demonstrate that the ZIC-HILIC column is not fit for purpose for the analysis of BMAA in cyanobacterial matrices and further provides explanations for the high level of negative results reported by researchers using this method.",Stephanie L Bishop;Susan J Murch

Our goal was to use microglia derived exosomes as a vehicle to deliver siRNA across the BBB to target human telomerase reverse transcriptase immortalized human microglial cells (HTHU) latently infected by HIV (HTHU-HIV) and to evaluate if the knockdown of Tspan2 gene expression in changes the activation state of microglia cells, thereby modulating the neuroinflammatory response. A blood brain barrier (BBB) model that closely mimics and accurately reflects the characteristics and functional properties of the in vivo BBB was used to examine HTHU microglia exosome effects on BBB permeability, and their ability to migrate across the and delivery small interfering RNA (siRNA) to cells on the CNS side of the BBB model. Exosomes were loaded with Texas-Red control siRNA (20 pmol) or Cy5-Tspan2 siRNA and then placed in the apical side of the BBB model, 24 h after incubation, HTHU-HIV cells microglial cells on the lower chamber were either imaged for siRNA uptake or analyzed for gene expression induced modifications. HTHU exosomes transmigrate from the apical side of the BBB to deliver Texas-Red control siRNA or Cy5-Tspan2 siRNA to HTHU-HIV microglia cells on the CNS side of the BBB model. A dose dependent (5-40 pmol) increase in Cy5-Tspan2 uptake with a corresponding decrease in gene expression for Tspan2 occurred in HTHU-HIV microglia. A decrease in Tspan2 gene expression as a consequence of knockdown with Tspan2 siRNA at both 20 and 40 pmol concentrations resulted in a significant decrease in C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) gene expression in HTHU-HIV microglia. Furthermore, a decrease in the gene expression levels of the Interleukins, IL-13 and IL-10 and an increase in the gene expression levels for the Fc gamma receptor 2A(FCGR2A) and TNF-α occurred in HTHU-HIV microglial cells These data demonstrate that HTHU exosomes cross the BBB and are efficient delivery vehicles to the CNS. Moreover, modifying the expression levels of Tspan2, has downstream consequences that includes alterations in cytokines and microglia biomarkers. Graphical Abstract Microglia-derived exosomes loaded with Tspan2 siRNA transmigrate across the BBB and knockdown Tspan2 gene expression in human microglial cells latently infected by HIV. This knockdown increases CXCL12, CXCR4, FCGR2A and TNF-α while decreasing IL-13 and IL-10 gene expression in HTHU-HIV microglial cells. Modulating Tspan2 modulates microglia cytokines and phenotype biomarkers.",Supriya D Mahajan
521,Tyler Lanman,"The development of novel antiretroviral treatments has led to a significant turning point in the fight against HIV. Although therapy leads to virologic suppression and prolonged life expectancies, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains prevalent. While various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, a growing body of literature explores the neurotoxic effects of antiretroviral therapy. Research to date brings into question the potential role of such medications in neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment seen in HIV-positive patients. This review highlights recent findings and controversies in cellular, molecular, and clinical neurotoxicity of antiretrovirals. It explores the pathogenesis of such toxicity and relates it to clinical manifestations in each medication class. The concept of accelerated aging in persons living with HIV (PLWH) as well as potential treatments for HAND are also discussed. Ultimately, this article hopes to educate clinicians and basic scientists about the neurotoxic effects of antiretrovirals and spur future scientific investigation into this important topic.

522,Anelya Kh Alieva,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In most cases, the development of the disease is sporadic and is not associated with any currently known mutations associated with PD. It is believed that changes associated with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The study of individuals with an almost identical genetic background, such as monozygotic twins, is one of the best approaches to the analysis of such changes. A whole-transcriptome analysis of dermal fibroblasts obtained from three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD was carried out in this work. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes were identified in the three pairs of twins. These genes were included in seven processes within two clusters, according to the results of an enrichment analysis. The cluster with the greatest statistical significance included processes associated with the regulation of the differentiation of fat cells, the action potential, and the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The most significant genes, which occupied a central position in this cluster, were PTGS2, SCN9A, and GRIK2. These genes can be considered as potential candidate genes for PD.",Margarita M Rudenok;Ekaterina V Novosadova;Ivan N Vlasov;Elena L Arsenyeva;Anna V Rosinskaya;Igor A Grivennikov;Petr A Slominsky;Maria I Shadrina
523,Stanislav Rodkin,"Neuron and glia death after axon transection is regulated by various signaling proteins. Protein p53 is a key regulator of diverse cell functions including stress response, DNA repair, proliferation, and apoptosis. We showed that p53 was overexpressed in crayfish ganglia after bilateral axotomy. In the isolated crayfish stretch receptor, a simple natural neuroglial preparation, which consists of a single mechanoreceptor neuron (MRN) enveloped by glial cells, p53 regulated axotomy-induced death of glial cells remote from the axon transection site. In MRN, p53 immunofluorescence was highest in the nucleolus and in the narrow cytoplasmic ring around the nucleus; its levels in the nucleus and cytoplasm were lower. After axotomy, p53 accumulated in the neuronal perikaryon. Its immunofluorescence also increased in the neuronal and glial nuclei. However, p53 immunofluorescence in the most of neuronal nucleoli disappeared. Axotomy-induced apoptosis of remote glial cells increased in the presence of p53 activators WR-1065 and nutlin-3 but reduced by pifithrin-α that inhibits transcriptional activity of p53. Pifithrin-μ that inhibits p53 effect on mitochondria increased axotomy-induced apoptosis of remote glial cells but reduced their necrosis. Therefore, axotomy-induced apoptosis of remote glial cells was associated with p53 effect on transcription processes, whereas glial necrosis was rather associated with transcription-independent p53 effect on mitochondria. Apparently, the fate of remote glial cells in the axotomized crayfish stretch receptor is determined by the balance between different modalities of p53 activity.",Andrey Khaitin;Maria Pitinova;Valentina Dzreyan;Valeria Guzenko;Mikhail Rudkovskii;Svetlana Sharifulina;Anatoly Uzdensky

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for medically refractory Parkinson's disease (PD). During DBS surgery, intraoperative testing is performed to confirm optimal lead placement by determining the stimulation thresholds for symptom improvement and side effects. However, the reliability of intraoperative testing in predicting distant postoperative thresholds is unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that intraoperative testing reliably estimates postoperative thresholds for both symptom improvement and side effects.


METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed a prospective database with intraoperative and postoperative thresholds for symptom improvement and side effects from a cohort of 66 PD patients who underwent STN DBS. We recorded the stimulation locations relative to the mid-commissural point. Within-patient stimulation pairs were generated by clustering the intraoperative stimulation locations closest to the DBS contacts. We computed the distance between stimulation locations and atlas-based pyramidal tract (PT) and medial lemniscus (ML) masks. A leave-one-out cross-validation analysis was performed to determine the reliability of intraoperative testing in predicting postoperative thresholds while controlling for the distance from the relevant tracks.


RESULTS
Intraoperative testing reliably predicted (area under ROC >0.8) postoperative thresholds for tremor and rigidity improvements, as well as stimulation-induced motor contractions and paresthesias. The reliability was poor for improvement in bradykinesia.


CONCLUSION
Intraoperative testing reliably predicts postoperative thresholds. These results are relevant during the informed consent process and patient counseling for DBS surgery. These will also guide the development of future methods for intraoperative feedback, especially during asleep DBS.",Rahul Rege;Vibhor Krishna

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lurasidone for the treatment of Chinese schizophrenic patients.


METHODS
Hospitalized schizophrenia patients aged 18-65 were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind, double-dummy, flexible-dose treatment with lurasidone (40 or 80 mg/day) or risperidone (2, 4 or 6 mg/day). Efficacy was evaluated using a non-inferiority comparison of lurasidone relative to risperidone based on week 6 change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory measures, and electrocardiograms.


RESULTS
444 patients were screened to obtain an intent-to-treat sample of 384 patients, of whom 54 patients discontinued treatment prior to 6 weeks. Lurasidone met the criteria for non-inferiority versus risperidone on the PANSS total score. Adjusted mean (SE) change at week 6 on the PANSS total score was -31.2 (1.0) and - 34.9 (1.0) in the lurasidone and risperidone group, respectively. The mean difference score was 3.7, and the upper boundary of the 95%-confidence interval (1.0-6.3) was less than the prespecified margin of 7.0. No clinically meaningful between-treatment group differences were evident on secondary efficacy measures, including PANSS positive, PANSS negative, Clinical Global Impression scale - Severity, and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia scales. The incidence of adverse events was lower for lurasidone vs. risperidone for extrapyramidal symptoms (17.0% vs. 38.2%), akathisia (7.2% vs. 13.6%), prolactin increase (3.1% vs. 14.1%), and weight increase (0.5% vs. 5.2%).

529,Ilka Boehm,"Background
Epigenetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been shown to modulate the functioning of brain circuitry associated with the salience network and may heighten the risk for mental illness. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to test this epigenome–brain–behaviour pathway in patients with anorexia nervosa.


Methods
We obtained resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data and blood samples from 55 acutely underweight female patients with anorexia nervosa and 55 age-matched female healthy controls. We decomposed imaging data using independent component analysis. We used bisulfite pyrosequencing to analyze blood DNA methylation within the promoter region of SLC6A4. We then explored salience network rsFC patterns in the group × methylation interaction.


Results
We identified a positive relationship between SLC6A4 methylation levels and rsFC between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the salience network in patients with anorexia nervosa compared to healthy controls. Increased rsFC in the salience network mediated the link between SLC6A4 methylation and eating disorder symptoms in patients with anorexia nervosa. We confirmed findings of rsFC alterations for CpG-specific methylation at a locus with evidence of methylation correspondence between brain and blood tissue.


Limitations
This study was cross-sectional in nature, the sample size was modest for the method and methylation levels were measured peripherally, so findings cannot be fully generalized to brain tissue.


Conclusion
This study sheds light on the neurobiological process of how epigenetic variation in the SLC6A4 gene may relate to rsFC in the salience network that is linked to psychopathology in anorexia nervosa.",Esther Walton;Nina Alexander;Victoria-Luise Batury;Maria Seidel;Daniel Geisler;Joseph A.

530,Sung-Min Cho,"Introduction. Brain injury is a major determinant of outcomes in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Neurologic prognostication in ECMO has not been established. Absent electroencephalogram (EEG) reactivity and absent N20 on somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) are associated with poor outcome in other types of brain injuries, especially following cardiopulmonary arrest. It is currently known if the same criteria are applicable in patients on ECMO. Methods. Continuous EEG (cEEG) was performed for patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <8 and SSEP data were performed for patients with a motor GCS < 4 in a prospective observational cohort undergoing ECMO at a tertiary center. EEG variables including reactivity were collected. SSEPs were categorized into absence, delay, or presence of N20. Poor outcome was defined as cerebral performance category 3 to 5 at discharge. Results. We present 13 consecutive patients who underwent both cEEG and SSEP. The median time from cannulation to EEG and SSEP were 3 (interquartile range [IQR] = 1-6) and 5 (IQR = 2-7) days, respectively. All patients were in coma and 12 (92%) had poor outcomes. Ten (77%) underwent brain computed tomography, the findings of which explained coma in only 2. Patients (n = 12) with poor outcome had poor variability, absent reactivity, and lack of sleep features with diffusely slow theta-delta background on the EEG. Despite poor outcomes, all had relatively preserved or normal N20 responses. One patient with preserved reactivity and sleep features on the EEG and intact SSEP had a good outcome. Conclusions. Absent EEG reactivity with the preservation of SSEP N20 was associated with poor outcome in comatose ECMO patients. We advise caution in interpreting electrophysiological tests in prognosticating ECMO patients until the patterns and outcomes are better understood.",Chun Woo Choi;Glenn Whitman;Jose I Suarez;Nirma Carballido Martinez;Romergryko G Geocadin;Eva K Ritzl

Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration is characterized by severe, progressive dystonia. This study aims to describe the reported usage of cannabis products among children with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration.


METHODS
A cross-sectional, 37-item survey was distributed in April 2019 to the families of 44 children who participate in a clinical registry of individuals with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration.


RESULTS
We received 18 responses (40.9% response rate). Children were a mean of 11.0 (SD 4.3) years old. The 15 respondents with dystonia or spasticity were on a median of 2 tone medications (range 0-9). Seven children had ever used cannabis (38.9%). The most common source of information about cannabis was other parents. Children who had ever used cannabis were on more tone medications, were more likely to have used opiates, were less likely to be able to roll, and less likely to sit comfortably, than children who had never used cannabis. Four children reported moderate or significant improvement in dystonia with cannabis. Other areas reported to be moderate or significantly improved were pain (n = 3), sleep (n = 4), anxiety (n = 3), and behavior (n = 2). Adverse effects included sadness (n = 1), agitation/behavior change (n = 1), and tiredness (n = 1).


CONCLUSION
Cannabis use was commonly reported among children with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration whose parents responded to a survey, particularly when many other dystonia treatments had been tried. Physicians should be aware that parents may treat their child with severe, painful dystonia with cannabis. Placebo-controlled studies of products containing cannabidiol and 9-tetrahydrocannabinol are needed for pediatric tone disorders.",Allison Gregory;Katrina Wakeman;Alison Freed;Puneet Rai;Colin Roberts;Susan J Hayflick;Pennylope Hogarth
532,Hannah N Robeson,"BACKGROUND
Mammalian Shc (Src homology and collagen) proteins comprise a family of four phosphotyrosine adaptor molecules which exhibit varied spatiotemporal expression and signaling functions. ShcD is the most recently discovered homologue and it is highly expressed in the developing central nervous system (CNS) and adult brain. Presently however, its localization within specific cell types of mature neural structures has yet to be characterized.


RESULTS
In the current study, we examine the expression profile of ShcD in the adult rat CNS using immunohistochemistry, and compare with those of the neuronally enriched ShcB and ShcC proteins. ShcD shows relatively widespread distribution in the adult brain and spinal cord, with prominent levels of staining throughout the olfactory bulb, as well as in sub-structures of the cerebellum and hippocampus, including the subgranular zone. Co-localization studies confirm the expression of ShcD in mature neurons and progenitor cells. ShcD immunoreactivity is primarily localized to axons and somata, consistent with the function of ShcD as a cytoplasmic adaptor. Regional differences in expression are observed among neural Shc proteins, with ShcC predominating in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and some fiber tracts. Interestingly, ShcD is uniquely expressed in the olfactory nerve layer and in glomeruli of the main olfactory bulb.


CONCLUSIONS
Together our findings suggest that ShcD may provide a distinct signaling contribution within the olfactory system, and that overlapping expression of ShcD with other Shc proteins may allow compensatory functions in the brain.",Hayley R Lau;Laura A New;Jasmin Lalonde;John N Armstrong;Nina Jones

Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, genetic, neurodegenerative and ultimately fatal disease with no cure or progression-delaying treatment currently available. HD is characterized by a triad of cognitive, behavioural and motor symptoms. Evidence on epidemiology and management of HD is limited, especially for Germany. This study aims to estimate the incidence and prevalence of HD and analyze the current routine care based on German claims data.


METHODS
The source of data was a sample of the Institute for Applied Health Research Berlin (InGef) Research Database, comprising data of approximately four million insured persons from approximately 70 German statutory health insurances. The study was conducted in a retrospective cross-sectional design using 2015 and 2016 as a two-year observation period. At least two outpatient or inpatient ICD-10 codes for HD (ICD-10: G10) during the study period were required for case identification. Patients were considered incident if no HD diagnoses in the 4 years prior to the year of case identification were documented. Information on outpatient drug dispensations, medical aids and remedies were considered to describe the current treatment situation of HD patients.


RESULTS
A 2-year incidence of 1.8 per 100,000 persons (95%-Confidence interval (CI): 1.4-2.4) and a 2-year period prevalence of 9.3 per 100,000 persons (95%-CI: 8.3-10.4) was observed. The prevalence of HD increased with advancing age, peaking at 60-69 years (16.8 per 100,000 persons; 95%-CI: 13.4-21.0) and decreasing afterwards. The most frequently observed comorbidities and disease-associated symptoms in HD patients were depression (42.9%), dementia (37.7%), urinary incontinence (32.5%), extrapyramidal and movement disorders (30.5%), dysphagia (28.6%) and disorders of the lipoprotein metabolism (28.2%). The most common medications in HD patients were antipsychotics (66.9%), followed by antidepressants (45.1%). Anticonvulsants (16.6%), opioids (14.6%) and hypnotics (9.7%) were observed less frequently. Physical therapy was the most often used medical aid in HD patients (46.4%). Nursing services and speech therapy were used by 27.9 and 22.7% of HD patients, respectively, whereas use of psychotherapy was rare (3.2%).

Cerebral palsy (CP) is considered as the main cause of severe physical impairment and malnutrition in children. This cross-sectional study intended to survey the nutritional status of children cerebral palsy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.


METHODS
We examined 74 children (age: 1-10 yrs) with CP, who attended Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Humanitarian City (SBAHC), Riyadh Saudi Arabia. Data on age, general demographics, nutritional status, and dietary intake were collected. A child was considered underweight, wasted, stunted or thin if the standard deviation scores for his/her weight for age, weight for height, height for age and body mass index for age were ≤ -2.0 standard deviation (SD) using WHO growth standards. Multivariable logistic regression identified the factors associated with nutritional indicators.


RESULTS
More than half (56.4%) of the children with cerebral palsy were malnourished as they had z-score below <-2 SD in at least one of the four indicators. Thinness (50%) was the most common form of malnutrition, followed by underweight, stunting, and wasting. Arm anthropometrics gave similar results on the percent number of malnourished children. Factors that were independently associated with malnutrition with an adjusted OR (aOR) were as follow: age ≤ 5 yrs. (aOR: 4.29); presence of cognitive impairment (aOR: 4.13); presence of anemia (aOR: 3.41) and inadequate energy intake (aOR: 4.86) (p, for all trends <0.05).

The pharmacodynamic results of diazepam and ethanol administration are similar, in that each can mediate amnestic and sedative-hypnotic effects. Although each of these molecules effectively reduce the activity of central neurons, diazepam does so through modulation of a more specific set of receptor targets (GABAA receptors containing a γ-subunit), while alcohol is less selective in its receptor bioactivity. Our investigation focuses on divergent actions of diazepam and ethanol on the firing patterns of cultured cortical neurons.


METHOD
We used electrophysiological recordings from organotypic slice cultures derived from Sprague-Dawley rat neocortex. We exposed these cultures to either diazepam (15 and 30 µM, n = 7) or ethanol (30 and 60 mM, n = 11) and recorded the electrical activity at baseline and experimental conditions. For analysis, we extracted the episodes of spontaneous activity, i.e., cortical up-states. After separation of action potential and local field potential (LFP) activity, we looked at differences in the number of action potentials, in the spectral power of the LFP, as well as in the coupling between action potential and LFP phase.


RESULTS
While both substances seem to decrease neocortical action potential firing in a not significantly different (p = 0.659, Mann-Whitney U) fashion, diazepam increases the spectral power of the up-state without significantly impacting the spectral composition, whereas ethanol does not significantly change the spectral power but the oscillatory architecture of the up-state as revealed by the Friedman test with Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05). Further, the action potential to LFP-phase coupling reveals a synchronizing effect of diazepam for a wide frequency range and a narrow-band de-synchronizing effect for ethanol (p < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).


CONCLUSION
Diazepam and ethanol, induce specific patterns of network depressant actions. Diazepam induces cortical network inhibition and increased synchronicity via gamma subunit containing GABAA receptors. Ethanol also induces cortical network inhibition, but without an increase in synchronicity via a wider span of molecular targets.",Paul S García;Verena Brucklacher-Waldert;Rebecca Claassen;Gerhard Schneider;Bernd Antkowiak;Berthold Drexler
536,Meike Annika Wilke,"BACKGROUND
A prosthetic system should ideally reinstate the bidirectional communication between the user's brain and its end effector by restoring both motor and sensory functions lost after an amputation. However, current commercial prostheses generally do not incorporate somatosensory feedback. Even without explicit feedback, grasping using a prosthesis partly relies on sensory information. Indeed, the prosthesis operation is characterized by visual and sound cues that could be exploited by the user to estimate the prosthesis state. However, the quality of this incidental feedback has not been objectively evaluated.


METHODS
In this study, the psychometric properties of the auditory and visual feedback of prosthesis motion were assessed and compared to that of a vibro-tactile interface. Twelve able-bodied subjects passively observed prosthesis closing and grasping an object, and they were asked to discriminate (experiment I) or estimate (experiment II) the closing velocity of the prosthesis using visual (VIS), acoustic (SND), or combined (VIS + SND) feedback. In experiment II, the subjects performed the task also with a vibrotactile stimulus (VIB) delivered using a single tactor. The outcome measures for the discrimination and estimation experiments were just noticeable difference (JND) and median absolute estimation error (MAE), respectively.


RESULTS
The results demonstrated that the incidental sources provided a remarkably good discrimination and estimation of the closing velocity, significantly outperforming the vibrotactile feedback. Using incidental sources, the subjects could discriminate almost the minimum possible increment/decrement in velocity that could be commanded to the prosthesis (median JND < 2% for SND and VIS + SND). Similarly, the median MAE in estimating the prosthesis velocity randomly commanded from the full working range was also low, i.e., approximately 5% in SND and VIS + SND.


CONCLUSIONS
Since the closing velocity is proportional to grasping force in state-of-the-art myoelectric prostheses, the results of the present study imply that the incidental feedback, when available, could be usefully exploited for grasping force control. Therefore, the impact of incidental feedback needs to be considered when designing a feedback interface in prosthetics, especially since the quality of estimation using supplemental sources (e.g., vibration) can be worse compared to that of the intrinsic cues.",Christian Niethammer;Britta Meyer;Dario Farina;Strahinja Dosen

It is widely accepted by the scientific community that bioelectrical signals, which can be used for the identification of neurophysiological biomarkers indicative of a diseased or pathological state, could direct patient treatment towards more effective therapeutic strategies. However, the design and realisation of an instrument that can precisely record weak bioelectrical signals in the presence of strong interference stemming from a noisy clinical environment is one of the most difficult challenges associated with the strategy of monitoring bioelectrical signals for diagnostic purposes. Moreover, since patients often have to cope with the problem of limited mobility being connected to bulky and mains-powered instruments, there is a growing demand for small-sized, high-performance and ambulatory biopotential acquisition systems in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and in High-dependency wards. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, there are no commercial, small, battery-powered, wearable and wireless recording-only instruments that claim the capability of recording electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals.


METHODS
To address this problem, we designed and developed a low-noise (8 nV/√Hz), eight-channel, battery-powered, wearable and wireless instrument (55 × 80 mm2). The performance of the realised instrument was assessed by conducting both ex vivo and in vivo experiments.


RESULTS
To provide ex vivo proof-of-function, a wide variety of high-quality bioelectrical signal recordings are reported, including electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG), electrocardiographic (ECG), acceleration signals, and muscle fasciculations. Low-noise in vivo recordings of weak local field potentials (LFPs), which were wirelessly acquired in real time using segmented deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted in the thalamus of a non-human primate, are also presented.


CONCLUSIONS
The combination of desirable features and capabilities of this instrument, namely its small size (~one business card), its enhanced recording capabilities, its increased processing capabilities, its manufacturability (since it was designed using discrete off-the-shelf components), the wide bandwidth it offers (0.5-500 Hz) and the plurality of bioelectrical signals it can precisely record, render it a versatile and reliable tool to be utilized in a wide range of applications and environments.",Simos Koutsoftidis;Thomas Guiho;Patrick Degenaar;Andrew Jackson;Stephen E Greenwald;Peter Brown;Timothy Denison;Emmanuel M Drakakis
538,Lan Li,"Purpose
To explore the functional connection strength (FCS) changes of brain networks in diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients and uncover the underlying mechanism.


Methods and Materials
Twenty-one patients with DR and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled from August 2012 to September 2014. Subjects were scanned using 3T MR with blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) and 3-dimension fast spoiled gradient echo (3D-FSPGR) sequences. MR data was analyzed via preprocessing and functional network construction. After a group comparison, components of brain networks with significant group differences were extracted and the FCS of the brain network was evaluated. The brain areas were compared between patients and controls. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Connection strength was evaluated with alphasim, P<0.01.


Results
The component maps of altered brain networks with quantified FCS were obtained in DR patients, demonstrating more disconnections mainly in the bilateral Heschl's gyrus, left cuneus, left occipital lobe, bilateral amygdala, left parahippocampal, bilateral fusiform, and left superior parietal in the patients group compared to the healthy controls (P<0.01), while compensations may occur in the frontal-cingulum region, as well as among the right caudate, left thalamus, left inferior temporal lobe, and middle orbital frontal lobe.


Conclusion

However, there might be a frontal compensatory circle in patients with DR.",Hui Dai;Jun Ke;Cen Shi;Nan Jiang;Chun-Mei Yang
539,Wakaho Hayashi,"Purpose
Although gender differences have been reported in various aspects of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as prevalence, comorbidities, and social functioning, there have been few such studies conducted in Japan. Our research investigated gender differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of adults with ADHD in a Japanese clinical sample. Due to unique Japanese cultural ideals and expectations of women's behavior that are in opposition to ADHD symptoms, we hypothesized that women with ADHD experience more difficulties and present more dysfunctions than men. We tested the following hypotheses: first, women with ADHD have more comorbidities than men with ADHD; second, women with ADHD experience more social hardships than men, such as having less full-time employment and being more likely to be divorced.


Patients and methods
The subjects were 335 outpatients with a DSM-5 ADHD diagnosis, who visited our ADHD specialty clinic at Showa University Karasuyama Hospital in central Tokyo between April 2015 and March 2016. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected, and gender differences were compared.


Results
Results fully supported our hypotheses: women had a significantly higher psychiatric comorbidity rate, were significantly less likely to be a full-time employee, and were significantly more likely to be divorced than men with ADHD.


Conclusion
Consistent with research in other countries, women with ADHD have greater impairments than men with ADHD in Japan.

The Devereux Early Childhood Assessment for Toddlers (DECA-T), which is one of the few standardized, norm-referenced behavioral rating scales related to young children's mental health, resilience, and social-emotional development, was developed for toddlers aged between 18 and 36 months.


Objective
The aim of this study was to test the clinimetric properties of the Chinese (Traditional) version of the DECA-T (C-DECA-T) using a classical test theory analysis and an item response theory analysis.


Methods
Seventy-five community-based toddlers aged from 18 to 36 months and 50 clinic-based participants recruited in hospitals in northern Taiwan participated in this study. Social-emotional competence was assessed by the C-DECA-T and children's behavior problems were rated via the Child Behavior Checklist 1.5 to 5 (CBCL/1.5-5). Homogeneity of the C-DECA-T was assessed by Mokken analysis; sensitivity and specificity were assessed via receiver operating characteristic curve.


Results
The results showed the C-DECA-T demonstrated good test-retest reliability (r=0.8) and high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94). Inter-rater reliability between father and mother was fair (ICC = 0.46). Convergent validity of the CBCL/1.5-5 total behavior problems (r=-0.26) demonstrated acceptable psychometric performance. The overall measure of the sampling adequacy of the C-DECA-T assessed by principal component analysis was 0.93. Mokken scale analysis showed the 36-items of the C- DECA-T formed a weak unidimensional scale (H =0.35), supporting its construct validity. The area under curve of the C-DECA-T in prediction of social-emotional disturbance was 0.70. The optimal cutoff of the Total Protective Factor score of the C-DECA-T was a T score of 40.1 (T40.1), with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 68%. Item 2 (""show affection for a familiar adult"") and item 33 (""calm herself/himself"") provide a good amount of information for the assessment of social-emotional strength and needs of a toddler in clinical practice.


Conclusion
The C-DECA-T showed good psychometric properties. Our findings of high internal consistency of the three subscales and total score of the C-DECA-T suggest symptom manifestation of social-emotional competence and needs in Taiwanese toddlers is not culturally different from American toddlers. The clinimetric properties of the C-DECA-T examined by a classical test theory analysis approach and an item response theory analysis approach suggest that the C-DECA-T is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring social-emotional strength and needs in the population in Taiwan.",Jen-Yu Chou;Yu-Yu Wu;Chin-Pang Lee;Brent Allan Kelsen;Yi-Chen Lee
541,Wen-Qiang Xin,"Background
Endovascular coiling and surgical clipping are routinely used to treat unruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysms (MCAAs). However, the optimal treatment for unruptured MCAAs is controversial. We aimed to systematically and comprehensively compare the clinical outcomes between endovascular coiling and surgical clipping for the treatment of MCAAs.


Method
This meta-analysis retrieved academic articles comparing the clinical outcomes between endovascular coiling and surgical clipping for unruptured MCAAs from the Cochrane Library, Medline, PubMed, and EMBASE databases. The reference articles of the identified studies were carefully reviewed to ensure that all available articles were represented in the study. The meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the acknowledged the prioritized reported items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.


Results
A total of 6 studies, which enrolled a total of 789 participants, were included in our analysis. Of these 789 patients with MCAAs, 144 were assigned to an endovascular coiling group, and 645 were assigned to a surgical clipping group. Our results demonstrated that endovascular coiling was associated with a higher rate of retreatment (OR = 104.926; 95% CI: 12.931 to 851.379; P<0.001) and postoperative complications (OR = 3.157; 95% CI: 1.239 to 8.048; P= 0.016) than surgical clipping, especially for postoperative thrombus without infarction (OR = 4.905, 95% CI: 1.097 to 21.933; P = 0.037). Furthermore, surgical clipping was related to a higher rate of complete occlusion (OR = 0.349, 95% CI: 0.140 to 0.872; P = 0.024) and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) ≥4 (OR = 0.250; 95% CI: 0.072 to 0.867; P= 0.029) than endovascular coiling after the operation. However, there was no significant difference in the rate of death, the proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS)>2, infarction, or bleeding.


Conclusion
Although this study has inherent limitations, surgical clipping of unruptured MCAAs resulted in significantly higher complete aneurysm occlusion and GOS≥4 rates and was associated with a lower incidence of retreatment and complication, especially for postoperative thrombus without infarction. Therefore, the effect induced by surgical clipping of unruptured MCAAs remains superior to that induced by endovascular coiling; surgical clipping should be regarded as the first choice of treatment for unruptured MCAAs.",Qi-Qiang Xin;Xin-Yu Yang
542,Gabriella Soós,"Taste is not a veridical perception: it is modifiable by cognitive and affective processes, as well as by expectations. Even though molecular composition determines the savor, various other factors such as external characteristics and basic assumptions have a sway over perceived pleasantness of food and drink. The rituals associated with wine tastings especially underscore the importance of these subjective ramifications. While auditory stimuli are known to influence drinking experience, the impact of melody on the product itself and on corollary consumer preference is unknown. As routine judgments are also influenced by informational cues, here we evaluated whether description of a unique technological innovation (i.e., serenaded grapes and barrels) as cogent suggestion of quality improves willingness to buy. This project unveils that the belief about music-fed wines, which might be construed as a motivational bias, can alter purchasing decisions; however, further neuro-marketing studies are warranted with this respect.",József Csernák;László Lakatos;Zsolt Zsófi;András Palotás

Microflora communities in the feces of the patients and corresponding healthy controls (HCs) were examined using high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The gut microflora of OPD patients contained high levels of Rikenellaceae compared to corresponding HCs. In addition, significantly higher levels of Turicibacteraceae were found in the NPD group compared to the corresponding HCs. The genera Turicibacter and Prevotella were significantly correlated with the PD severity scores.

544,Kate Gfeller,"Background
Cochlear implants (CIs), which have been designed primarily to support spoken communication of persons with severe to profound hearing loss, are highly effective in supporting speech perception in quiet listening conditions. CI users as a group achieve significantly poorer perception and appraisal of music, and speech perception is compromised when background music is present, though outcomes vary considerably across recipients. A number of factors have been identified that contribute to variable music listening experiences, but many questions remain, particularly regarding experiences in everyday life from the perspective of CI users.


Purpose
The purpose of this study was twofold: The first aim was to explore the perspectives of adult CI recipients regarding two experiences with music in everyday life: purposeful music listening and background music that competes with spoken conversation. The second aim was to develop a framework of everyday music experiences based upon CI perspectives that could inform future rehabilitative practices and research initiatives.


Methods
Qualitative and patient-engaged research methodologies were used to emphasize the perspectives of the CI users. Participants included 40 experienced adult CI users ranging in age from 19 to 81 enrolled in 13 CI centers. Participants completed on-line semi-structured open-ended questionnaires regarding purposeful music listening and background music in conjunction with spoken communication. Responses were analyzed using an iterative inductive coding process consistent with grounded theory methodology. The interrelated themes that emerged from the data were then organized into a model synthesizing components from models on music response and self-management for persons with chronic health conditions.


Outcomes
Data analyses informed the development of a Dynamic Problem Solving Model for Management of Music Listening Environments adapted from Hill-Briggs (2003) Problem Solving Model of Chronic Illness Self-Management. Key findings were: (1) Music listening is a dynamic, multifaceted experience; satisfactory listening depended upon optimal combinations of factors; (2) Music listening is effortful, but the extent of satisfaction is influenced by expectations and self-management of the situation; (3) CI users have limited access to resources for optimizing music experiences. Many CI users would consider rehabilitation, but level of commitment and priorities differ across CI users.",Virginia Driscoll;Adam Schwalje
545,Cecilia Lindig-León,"In the face of limited computational resources, bounded rational decision theory predicts that information-processing should be concentrated on actions that make a significant contribution in terms of the utility achieved. Accordingly, information-processing can be simplified by choosing stereotypic actions that lead to satisfactory performance over a range of different inputs rather than choosing a specific action for each input. Such a set of similar inputs with similar action responses would then correspond to an abstraction that can be harnessed with possibly negligible loss in utility, but with potentially considerable savings in information-processing effort. Here we test this prediction in an identification task, where human subjects were asked to estimate the roundness of ellipses varying from a straight line to a perfect circle. Crucially, when reporting their estimates, subjects could choose between three different levels of precision corresponding to three levels of abstraction in a decision-making hierarchy. To induce changes in level selection, we manipulated the information-processing resources available at the perceptual and action stages by varying the difficulty of identifying the stimulus and by enforcing different response times in the action stage. In line with theoretical predictions, we find that subjects adapt their abstraction level depending on the available resources. We compare subjects' behavior to the maximum efficiency predicated by the bounded rational decision-making model and investigate possible sources of inefficiency.",Sebastian Gottwald;Daniel A Braun
546,Carlos Roncero,"We evaluated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in two different montages could improve picture naming abilities in participants with anomic Alzheimer Disease or Frontotemporal dementia.


Methods
Utilizing a double-blind cross-over design, twelve participants were trained on picture naming over a series of 10 sessions with 30 min of anodal (2 mA) tDCS stimulation to either the left inferior parietotemporal region (P3), the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3), or sham stimulation. We evaluated performance on a trained picture naming list, an equivalent novel untrained list, and additional neuropsychological tasks.


Results
For trained item picture naming, significantly larger improvement was seen for real stimulation vs. sham stimulation for both the DLPFC and left inferior parieto-temporal stimulation montages at the end of the stimulation sessions. The parieto-temporal montage remained superior to sham 2 weeks poststimulation. Significant improvement vs. sham was also seen for novel ""untrained"" item picture naming 2 weeks post-stimulation when the parieto-temporal montage was given, whereas no change was observed when the DLPFC montage was given. Finally, comparing groups when they received the parieto-temporal montage, participants with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) showed the least improvement for untrained items after their sessions. Scores on the additional neuropsychological tasks were unchanged.


Conclusion
tDCS stimulation has promise as a treatment for individuals with anomia arising from neurodegenerative disease, but its effectiveness can vary depending on the training given, the montage location used, as well as a participants' diagnosis.",Erik Service;Marco De Caro;Aleksandar Popov;Alexander Thiel;Stephan Probst;Howard Chertkow
547,Ankita Salvi,"Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a major contributor to global air pollution. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that air pollution due to gasoline and diesel emissions from internal combustion engines of automobiles, trucks, locomotives, and ships leads to 800,000 premature deaths annually due to pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurological complications. It has been observed that individuals living and working in areas of heavy vehicle traffic have high susceptibility to anxiety, depression, and cognitive deficits. Information regarding the mechanisms that potentially lead to detrimental mental health effects of TRAP is gradually increasing. Several studies have suggested that TRAP is associated with adverse effects in the central nervous system (CNS), primarily due to increase in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Animal studies have provided further useful insights on the deleterious effects of vehicle exhaust emissions (VEEs). The mechanistic basis for these effects is unclear, although gasoline and diesel exhaust-induced neurotoxicity seems the most plausible cause. Several important points emerge from these studies. First, TRAP leads to neurotoxicity. Second, TRAP alters neurobehavioral function. Exactly how that happens remains unclear. This review article will discuss current state of the literature on this subject and potential leads that have surfaced from the preclinical work.",Samina Salim
548,Cheng-Kun Deng,"Cognitive dysfunction is a very severe consequence of diabetes, but the underlying causes are still unclear. Recently, the cerebellum was reported to play an important role in learning and memory. Since long-term depression (LTD) is a primary cellular mechanism for cerebellar motor learning, we aimed to explore the role of cerebellar LTD pathways in diabetic rats and the therapeutic effect of gastrodin. Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin into adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Motor learning ability was assessed by a beam walk test. Pathological changes of the cerebellum were assessed by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and Nissl staining. Cellular apoptosis was assessed by anti-caspase-3 immunostaining. Protein expression levels of LTD pathway-related factors, including GluR2, protein kinase C (PKC), NR2A, and nNOS, in the cerebellar cortex were evaluated by western blotting and double immunofluorescence. The NO concentration was measured. The cellular degeneration and the apoptosis of Purkinje cells were evident in the cerebellum of diabetic rats. Protein expression levels of GluR2 (NC9W: 1.26 ± 0.12; DM9W + S: 0.81 ± 0.07), PKC (NC9W: 1.66 ± 0.10; DM9W + S: 0.58 ± 0.19), NR2A (NC9W: 1.40 ± 0.05; DM9W + S: 0.63 ± 0.06), nNOS (NC9W: 1.26 ± 0.12; DM9W + S: 0.68 ± 0.04), and NO (NC9W: 135.61 ± 31.91; DM9W + S: 64.06 ± 24.01) in the cerebellum were significantly decreased in diabetic rats. Following gastrodin intervention, the outcome of motor learning ability was significantly improved (NC9W: 6.70 ± 3.31; DM9W + S: 20.47 ± 9.43; DM9W + G: 16.04 ± 7.10). In addition, degeneration and apoptosis were ameliorated, and this was coupled with the elevation of the protein expression of the abovementioned biomarkers. Arising from the above, we concluded that gastrodin may contribute to the improvement of motor learning by protecting the LTD pathways in Purkinje cells.",Zhi-Hao Mu;Yi-He Miao;Yi-Dan Liu;Lei Zhou;Yong-Jie Huang;Fan Zhang;Yao-Yi Wang;Zhi-Hong Yang;Zhong-Yi Qian;Xie Wang;Jia-Zhi Guo;Mei-Yan Zhang;Xin-Yu Liao;Qi Wan;Di Lu;Ying-Ying Zou
549,Qiyun Huang,"Most existing brain-computer Interfaces (BCIs) are designed to control a single assistive device, such as a wheelchair, a robotic arm or a prosthetic limb. However, many daily tasks require combined functions which can only be realized by integrating multiple robotic devices. Such integration raises the requirement of the control accuracy and is more challenging to achieve a reliable control compared with the single device case. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid BCI with high accuracy based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) to control an integrated wheelchair robotic arm system. The user turns the wheelchair left/right by performing left/right hand motor imagery (MI), and generates other commands for the wheelchair and the robotic arm by performing eye blinks and eyebrow raising movements. Twenty-two subjects participated in a MI training session and five of them completed a mobile self-drinking experiment, which was designed purposely with high accuracy requirements. The results demonstrated that the proposed hBCI could provide satisfied control accuracy for a system that consists of multiple robotic devices, and showed the potential of BCI-controlled systems to be applied in complex daily tasks.",Zhijun Zhang;Tianyou Yu;Shenghong He;Yuanqing Li
550,Xingui Zhang,"In auditory-conditioned fear learning, the freezing response is independent of the sound frequencies used, but the frequency of the conditioned sound is considered distinct from those of unrelated sounds based on electrophysiological responses in the auditory system. Whether an emergent discriminative learning underlies auditory fear conditioning and which nuclei and pathways are involved in it remain unclear. Using behavioral and electrophysiological assays, we found that the response of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons to a conditioned auditory stimulus (CS) was enhanced relative to the response to unrelated frequencies (UFs) after auditory fear conditioning, and mice could distinguish the CS during multifrequency testing, a phenomenon called emergent discriminative learning. After silencing the mPFC with muscimol, emergent discriminative learning was blocked. In addition, the pure tone responses of mPFC neurons were inhibited after injection of lidocaine in the ipsilateral primary auditory cortex (A1), and the emergent discriminative learning was blocked by silencing both sides of A1 with muscimol. This study, therefore, provides evidence for an emergent discriminative learning mediated by mPFC and A1 neurons after auditory fear conditioning.",Xianhua Ye;Rui Cheng;Qi Li;Zhongju Xiao
551,Søren F V Nielsen,"A core symptom of mood disorders is cognitive impairment in attention, memory and executive functions. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a candidate treatment for cognitive impairment in unipolar and bipolar disorders (UD and BD) and modulates cognition-related neural activity across a fronto-temporo-parietal network. This report investigates predicting the pharmacological treatment from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using a supervised machine learning approach. A total of 84 patients with UD or BD were included in a randomized double-blind parallel-group study in which they received eight weekly infusions of either EPO (40 000 IU) or saline. Task fMRI data were collected before EPO/saline infusions started (baseline) and 6 weeks after last infusion (follow-up). During the scanning sessions, participants were given an n-back working memory and a picture encoding task. Linear classification models with different regularization techniques were used to predict treatment status from both cross-sectional data (at follow-up) and longitudinal data (difference between baseline and follow-up). For the n-back and picture encoding tasks, data were available and analyzed for 52 (EPO; n = 28, Saline; n = 24) and 59 patients (EPO; n = 31, Saline; n = 28), respectively. We found limited evidence that the classifiers used could predict treatment status at a reliable level of performance (≤60% accuracy) when tested using repeated cross-validation. There was no difference in using cross-sectional versus longitudinal data. Whole-brain multivariate decoding applied to pharmaco-fMRI in small to moderate samples seems to be suboptimal for exploring data driven neuronal treatment mechanisms.",Kristoffer H Madsen;Maj Vinberg;Lars V Kessing;Hartwig R Siebner;Kamilla W Miskowiak
552,Chu-Ting Chang,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are important acid sensors involved in neural modulation in the central nervous system and pain-associated tissue acidosis in the peripheral system. Among ASIC subtypes, ASIC1b is the most selectively expressed in peripheral sensory neurons. However, the role of ASIC1b is still elusive in terms of its functions and expression profile. In this study, we probed the role of ASIC1b in acid-induced muscle pain in Asic1b-knockout (Asic1b -/-) and Asic1b-Cre transgenic (Asic1b  ) mice. We tested the effect of ASIC1b knockout in a mouse model of fibromyalgia induced by dual intramuscular acid injections. In this model, a unilateral acid injection to the gastrocnemius muscle induced transient bilateral hyperalgesia in wild-type (Asic1b +  +) but not Asic1b -/- mice; a second acid injection, spaced 1 or 5 days apart, to the same muscle induced chronic hyperalgesia lasting for 4 weeks in Asic1b +  + mice, but the duration of hyperalgesia was significantly shortened in Asic1b -/- mice. Mambalgin-1, an ASIC1b-containing channel inhibitor that was mixed with acid saline at the first injection, dose-dependently blocked the acid-induced transient and chronic hyperalgesia in Asic1b +  + mice. In contrast, psalmotoxin 1 (PcTx1), an ASIC1a-selective antagonist, had no effect on acid-induced transient or chronic hyperalgesia. We used whole-cell patch clamp recording to study the properties of acid-induced currents in ASIC1b-expressing dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons from Asic1b  -TdTomato reporter mice. Medium- to large-sized ASIC1b-expressing DRG neurons mainly exhibited an amiloride-sensitive ASIC-like biphasic current (I ASIC) in response to acid stimulation, whereas small- to medium-sized ASIC1b-expressing DRG neurons predominantly exhibited an amiloride-insensitive sustained current. Specifically, mambalgin-1 selectively inhibited the I ASIC in most ASIC1b-expressing DRG neurons. However, PcTx1 or APETx2 (an ASIC3-selective antagonist) had only a mild inhibitory effect on I ASIC in about half of the ASIC1b-expressing DRG neurons. In situ hybridization revealed that ASIC1b-positive DRG neurons co-expressed highly with ASIC1a and ASIC2a mRNA and partially with ASIC3 and ASIC2b. Thus, ASIC1b might form a wide variety of heteromeric channels. ASIC1b-containing heteromeric channels might be promising targets for the therapeutic treatment of acid-induced chronic muscle pain.",Sitt Wai Fong;Cheng-Han Lee;Yu-Chia Chuang;Shing-Hong Lin;Chih-Cheng Chen
553,Carlos A Loza,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aim to bypass the peripheral nervous system to link the brain to external devices via successful modeling of decoding mechanisms. BCI based on electrocorticogram or ECoG represent a viable compromise between clinical practicality, spatial resolution, and signal quality when it comes to extracellular electrical potentials from local neuronal assemblies. Classic analysis of ECoG traces usually falls under the umbrella of Time-Frequency decompositions with adaptations from Fourier analysis and wavelets as its most prominent variants. However, analyzing such high-dimensional, multivariate time series demands for specialized signal processing and neurophysiological principles. We propose a generative model for single-channel ECoGs that is able to fully characterize reoccurring rhythm-specific neuromodulations as weighted activations of prototypical templates over time. The set of timings, weights and indexes comprise a temporal marked point process (TMPP) that accesses a set of bases from vector spaces of different dimensions-a dictionary. The shallow nature of the model admits the equivalence between latent variables and representations. In this way, learning the model parameters is a case of unsupervised representation learning. We exploit principles of Minimum Description Length (MDL) encoding to effectively yield a data-driven framework where prototypical neuromodulations (not restricted to a particular duration) can be estimated alongside the timings and features of the TMPP. We validate the proposed methodology on discrimination of movement-related tasks utilizing 32-electrode grids implanted in the frontal cortex of six epileptic subjects. We show that the learned representations from the high-gamma band (85-145 Hz) are not only interpretable, but also discriminant in a lower dimensional space. The results also underscore the practicality of our algorithm, i.e., 2 main hyperparameters that can be readily set via neurophysiology, and emphasize the need of principled and interpretable representation learning in order to model encoding mechanisms in the brain.",Chandan G Reddy;Shailaja Akella;José C Príncipe
554,Ke Ma,"Stroke patients often use trunk to compensate for impaired upper limb motor function during upper limb rehabilitation training, which results in a reduced rehabilitation training effect. Detecting trunk compensations can improve the effect of rehabilitation training. This study investigates the feasibility of a surface electromyography-based trunk compensation detection (sEMG-bTCD) method. Five healthy subjects and nine stroke subjects with cognitive and comprehension skills were recruited to participate in the experiments. The sEMG signals from nine superficial trunk muscles were collected during three rehabilitation training tasks (reach-forward-back, reach-side-to-side, and reach-up-to-down motions) without compensation and with three common trunk compensations [lean-forward (LF), trunk rotation (TR), and shoulder elevation (SE)]. Preprocessing like filtering, active segment detection was performed and five time domain features (root mean square, variance, mean absolute value (MAV), waveform length, and the fourth order autoregressive model coefficient) were extracted from the collected sEMG signals. Excellent TCD performance was achieved in healthy participants by using support vector machine (SVM) classifier (LF: accuracy = 94.0%, AUC = 0.97, F1 = 0.94; TR: accuracy = 95.8%, AUC = 0.99, F1 = 0.96; SE: accuracy = 100.0%, AUC = 1.00, F1 = 1.00). By using SVM classifier, TCD performance in stroke participants was also obtained (LF: accuracy = 74.8%, AUC = 0.90, F1 = 0.73; TR: accuracy = 67.1%, AUC = 0.85, F1 = 0.71; SE: accuracy = 91.3%, AUC = 0.98, F1 = 0.90). Compared with the methods based on cameras or inertial sensors, better detection performance was obtained in both healthy and stroke participants. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the sEMG-bTCD method, and it helps to prompt the stroke patients to correct their incorrect posture, thereby improving the effectiveness of rehabilitation training.",Yan Chen;Xiaoya Zhang;Haiqing Zheng;Song Yu;Siqi Cai;Longhan Xie

Optic radiation (OR) tractography may help predict and reduce post-neurosurgical visual field deficits. OR tractography methods currently lack pediatric and surgical focus.


Purpose
We propose a clinically feasible OR tractography strategy in a pediatric neurosurgery setting and examine its intra-rater and inter-rater reliability/agreements.


Methods
Preoperative and intraoperative MRI data were obtained from six epilepsy and two brain tumor patients on 3 Tesla MRI scanners. Four raters with different clinical experience followed the proposed strategy to perform probabilistic OR tractography with manually drawing anatomical landmarks to reconstruct the OR pathway, based on fiber orientation distributions estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging data. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities/agreements of tractography results were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and dice similarity coefficient (DSC) across various tractography and OR morphological metrics, including the lateral geniculate body positions, tract volumes, and Meyer's loop position from temporal anatomical landmarks.


Results
Good to excellent intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was demonstrated for the majority of OR reconstructions (ICC = 0.70-0.99; DSC = 0.84-0.89). ICC was higher for non-lesional (0.82-0.99) than lesional OR (0.70-0.99). The non-lesional OR's mean volume was 22.66 cm3; the mean Meyer's loop position was 29.4 mm from the temporal pole, 5.89 mm behind of and 10.26 mm in front of the temporal ventricular horn. The greatest variations (± 1.00-3.00 mm) were observed near pathology, at the tract edges or at cortical endpoints. The OR tractography were used to assist surgical planning and guide lesion resection in all cases, no patient had new visual field deficits postoperatively.

The proposed tractography strategy generates reliable and reproducible OR tractography images that can be reliably implemented in the routine, non-emergency pediatric neurosurgical setting.",Richard Beare;Michelle Hao Wu;Sarah M Barton;Charles B Malpas;Chun-Hung Yeh;A Simon Harvey;Vicki Anderson;Wirginia J Maixner;Marc Seal
556,Kaitlyn R Calabro,"Usher's syndrome is the most common combined blindness-deafness disorder with USH1B, caused by mutations in MYO7A, resulting in the most severe phenotype. The existence of numerous, naturally occurring shaker1 mice harboring variable MYO7A mutations on different genetic backgrounds has complicated the characterization of MYO7A knockout (KO) and heterozygote mice. We generated a novel MYO7A KO mouse (Myo7a -  -) that is easily genotyped, maintained, and confirmed to be null for MYO7A in both the eye and inner ear. Like USH1B patients, Myo7a -  - mice are profoundly deaf, and display near complete loss of inner and outer cochlear hair cells (HCs). No gross structural changes were observed in vestibular HCs. Myo7a -  - mice exhibited modest declines in retinal function but, unlike patients, no loss of retinal structure. We attribute the latter to differential expression of MYO7A in mouse vs. primate retina. Interestingly, heterozygous Myo7a +  - mice had reduced numbers of cochlear HCs and concomitant reductions in auditory function relative to Myo7a +/+ controls. Notably, this is the first report that loss of a single Myo7a allele significantly alters auditory structure and function and suggests that audiological characterization of USH1B carriers is warranted. Maintenance of vestibular HCs in Myo7a -  - mice suggests that gene replacement could be used to correct the vestibular dysfunction in USH1B patients. While Myo7a -  - mice do not exhibit sufficiently robust retinal phenotypes to be used as a therapeutic outcome measure, they can be used to assess expression of vectored MYO7A on a null background and generate valuable pre-clinical data toward the treatment of USH1B.",Sanford L Boye;Shreyasi Choudhury;Diego Fajardo;James J Peterson;Wei Li;Sean M Crosson;Mi-Jung Kim;Dalian Ding;Richard Salvi;Shinichi Someya;Shannon E Boye
557,Yuki Tanaka,"The pathological aggregation of tau characterizes a set of neurodegenerative diseases collectively referred to as tauopathies. Recent studies using cellular and animal models have suggested that tau pathology progresses by trans-cellular propagation. The process of propagation is mediated by certain species of extracellular tau, which are taken up by recipient cells and serve as a seed for tau aggregation. Tau propagation is currently one of the most active areas of research in dementia. Previous efforts to identify the specific tau molecules involved in propagation have suggested that multiple forms of tau with different molecular weights derived from recombinant tau or brain lysates exert seeding activity. Nonetheless, the molecular characteristics of the ""extracellular"" seed-competent tau as well as its release mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Given that tau is physiologically released into the extracellular space, it is critical to distinguish seed-competent tau from normal monomeric tau. Utilizing biosensor cells expressing P301S mutant tau fused to CFP/YFP, here we discriminated between seed-competent tau and inert monomer tau released from HEK293 cells. By analyzing the size-exclusion fractions of the media, we found that seed-competent tau was enriched in high molecular weight fractions of >2,000 kDa, while the majority of soluble tau in the media positively detected by ELISA was in low molecular weight fractions. We also found that lysosomal stress not only increased Ca2+-dependent release of seed-competent tau but also altered its molecular size. Inhibiting lysosomal exocytosis specifically decreased release of seed-competent tau without influencing total tau. These data underscore the differential response of seed-competent tau and inert tau to lysosomal stress and indicates the presence of distinct release mechanisms via lysosomes.",Kaoru Yamada;Kyoko Satake;Itaru Nishida;Matthias Heuberger;Tomoki Kuwahara;Takeshi Iwatsubo

To determine the relationship between alterations in resting state functional connectivity and social cognition dysfunction among patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls (HC).


Methods
Fifty-seven participants (FTD = 10, AD = 18, PD = 19, and HC = 10) underwent structural and functional imaging and completed the Awareness of Social Inference Test-Emotion Evaluation Test (TASIT-EET), Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scale, Revised Self-Monitoring Scale (RSMS), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ). A multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA) was carried out to determine activation differences between the groups. The clusters from the MVPA were used as seeds for the ROI-to-voxel analysis. Relationship between social cognition deficits and uncinate integrity was also investigated.


Results
BOLD signal activation differed among the four groups of AD, PD, FTD, and HC in the left inferior temporal gyrus-anterior division [L-ITG (ant)], right central opercular cortex (R-COp), right supramarginal gyrus, posterior division (R-SMG, post), right angular gyrus (R-AG), and R-ITG. The BOLD co-activation of the L-ITG (ant) with bilateral frontal pole (FP) and paracingulate gyrus was positively associated with IRI-perspective taking (PT) (r = 0.38, p = 0.007), SNQ total (r = 0.37, p = 0.009), and TASIT-EET (r = 0.47, p < 0.001).


Conclusion
Patients with neurodegenerative diseases showed alterations in connectivity in brain regions important for social cognition compared with HCs. Functional connectivity correlated with performance on social cognition tasks and alterations could be responsible for some of the social cognition deficits observed in all neurodegenerative diseases.",Foad Taghdiri;Cassandra J Anor;Brenda Varriano;Karen Misquitta;David F Tang-Wai;Ron Keren;Susan Fox;Anthony E Lang;Anne Catherine Vijverman;Connie Marras;Maria Carmela Tartaglia
559,Dick R Nässel,"Tachykinins (TKs) are ancient neuropeptides present throughout the bilaterians and are, with some exceptions, characterized by a conserved FX1GX2Ramide carboxy terminus among protostomes and FXGLMamide in deuterostomes. The best-known TK is the vertebrate substance P, which in mammals, together with other TKs, has been implicated in health and disease with important roles in pain, inflammation, cancer, depressive disorder, immune system, gut function, hematopoiesis, sensory processing, and hormone regulation. The invertebrate TKs are also known to have multiple functions in the central nervous system and intestine and these have been investigated in more detail in the fly Drosophila and some other arthropods. Here, we review the protostome and deuterostome organization and evolution of TK precursors, peptides and their receptors, as well as their functions, which appear to be partly conserved across Bilateria. We also outline the distribution of TKs in the brains of representative organisms. In Drosophila, recent studies have revealed roles of TKs in early olfactory processing, neuromodulation in circuits controlling locomotion and food search, nociception, aggression, metabolic stress, and hormone release. TK signaling also regulates lipid metabolism in the Drosophila intestine. In crustaceans, TK is an important neuromodulator in rhythm-generating motor circuits in the stomatogastric nervous system and a presynaptic modulator of photoreceptor cells. Several additional functional roles of invertebrate TKs can be inferred from their distribution in various brain circuits. In addition, there are a few interesting cases where invertebrate TKs are injected into prey animals as vasodilators from salivary glands or paralyzing agents from venom glands. In these cases, the peptides are produced in the glands of the predator with sequences mimicking the prey TKs. Lastly, the TK-signaling system appears to have duplicated in Panarthropoda (comprising arthropods, onychophores, and tardigrades) to give rise to a novel type of peptides, natalisins, with a distinct receptor. The distribution and functions of natalisins are distinct from the TKs. In general, it appears that TKs are widely distributed and act in circuits at short range as neuromodulators or cotransmitters.",Meet Zandawala;Tsuyoshi Kawada;Honoo Satake
560,Liam Gracia,"Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's are devastating neurodegenerative diseases that are prevalent in the aging population. Patient care costs continue to rise each year, because there is currently no cure or disease modifying treatments for these diseases. Numerous efforts have been made to understand the molecular interactions governing the disease development. These efforts have revealed that the phosphorylation of proteins by kinases may play a critical role in the aggregation of disease-associated proteins, which is thought to contribute to neurodegeneration. Interestingly, a molecular chaperone complex consisting of the 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) and Cell Division Cycle 37 (Cdc37) has been shown to regulate the maturation of many of these kinases as well as regulate some disease-associated proteins directly. Thus, the Hsp90/Cdc37 complex may represent a potential drug target for regulating proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases, through both direct and indirect interactions. Herein, we discuss the broad understanding of many Hsp90/Cdc37 pathways and how this protein complex may be a useful target to regulate the progression of neurodegenerative disease.",Gabriella Lora;Laura J Blair;Umesh K Jinwal
561,Christian Herff,"Neural interfaces that directly produce intelligible speech from brain activity would allow people with severe impairment from neurological disorders to communicate more naturally. Here, we record neural population activity in motor, premotor and inferior frontal cortices during speech production using electrocorticography (ECoG) and show that ECoG signals alone can be used to generate intelligible speech output that can preserve conversational cues. To produce speech directly from neural data, we adapted a method from the field of speech synthesis called unit selection, in which units of speech are concatenated to form audible output. In our approach, which we call Brain-To-Speech, we chose subsequent units of speech based on the measured ECoG activity to generate audio waveforms directly from the neural recordings. Brain-To-Speech employed the user's own voice to generate speech that sounded very natural and included features such as prosody and accentuation. By investigating the brain areas involved in speech production separately, we found that speech motor cortex provided more information for the reconstruction process than the other cortical areas.",Lorenz Diener;Miguel Angrick;Emily Mugler;Matthew C Tate;Matthew A Goldrick;Dean J Krusienski;Marc W Slutzky;Tanja Schultz
562,Anna Vera Cuppone,"Several reports indicate that spatial perception in blind individuals can be impaired as the lack of visual experience severely affects the development of multisensory spatial correspondences. Despite the growing interest in the development of technological devices to support blind people in their daily lives, very few studies have assessed the benefit of interventions that help to refine sensorimotor perception. In the present study, we directly investigated the impact of a short audio-motor training on auditory and proprioceptive spatial perception in blind individuals. Our findings indicate that auditory and proprioceptive spatial capabilities can be enhanced through interventions designed to foster sensorimotor perception in the form of audio-motor correspondences, demonstrating the importance of the early introduction of sensorimotor training in therapeutic intervention for blind individuals.",Giulia Cappagli;Monica Gori
563,Rama Ashraf Hussein,"The inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) plays an important role in rapid synaptic inhibition in mammalian spinal cord, brainstem, higher brain centers, and is involved in transmission of nociceptive signals. Glucose and related mono- and disaccharides potentiate currents mediated by recombinant α1, α1-β, and α3 GlyRs. Here, we confirmed the specific potentiation of α3 GlyR signaling by glucose through: (i) patch-clamp electrophysiology on recombinant receptors; and (ii) by verifying in vitro data in a mouse model in vivo. Mice were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with glucose (2 g/kg) or vehicle, and then challenged with sublethal doses of strychnine (0.2 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg). Pain-related behavior was assessed using two established models: (i) touch sensitivity tests using von Frey filaments; and (ii) hotplate assay. We observed a reduction of pain sensitivity in glucose-treated mice relative to vehicle-treated control mice. Injection of strychnine resulted in an increased sensitivity to tactile and heat stimuli, which was reversed in the presence of glucose. Analgesic effects of glucose were more pronounced in von Frey experiments, consistent with the established use of this model for neuropathic pain. Overall, glucose showed mild analgesic effects and was able to compensate for strychnine-induced allodynia in mice. Since the action of strychnine is specific for GlyR, these experiments show for the first time an in vivo potentiation of GlyR activity by glucose and suggest a molecular mechanism for glucose-mediated analgesia.",Marwa Ahmed;Hans-Georg Breitinger;Ulrike Breitinger
564,Mihaela Lorger,"Immune checkpoints restrain the immune system following its activation and their inhibition unleashes anti-tumor immune responses. Immune checkpoint inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of several cancer types, including melanoma, and immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is becoming a frontline therapy in metastatic melanoma. Notably, up to 60% of metastatic melanoma patients develop metastases in the brain. Brain metastases (BrM) are also very common in patients with lung and breast cancer, and occur in ∼20-40% of patients across different cancer types. Metastases in the brain are associated with poor prognosis due to the lack of efficient therapies. In the past, patients with BrM used to be excluded from immune-based clinical trials due to the assumption that such therapies may not work in the context of ""immune-specialized"" environment in the brain, or may cause harm. However, recent trials in patients with BrM demonstrated safety and intracranial activity of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. We here discuss how immune checkpoint therapy works in BrM, with focus on T cells and the cross-talk between BrM, the immune system, and tumors growing outside the brain. We discuss major open questions in our understanding of what is required for an effective immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in BrM.",Tereza Andreou;Christopher Fife;Fiona James
565,Theodora Kalpachidou,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as master switch regulators in many biological processes in health and disease, including neuropathy. miRNAs are commonly quantified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), usually estimated as relative expression through reference genes normalization. Different non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are used for miRNA normalization; however, there is no study identifying the optimal reference genes in animal models for peripheral nerve injury. We evaluated the stability of eleven ncRNAs, commonly used for miRNA normalization, in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), dorsal horn of the spinal cord (dhSC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the mouse spared nerve injury (SNI) model. After RT-qPCR, the stability of each ncRNA was determined by using four different methods: BestKeeper, the comparative delta-Cq method, geNorm, and NormFinder. The candidates were rated according to their performance in each method and an overall ranking list was compiled. The most stable ncRNAs were: sno420, sno429, and sno202 in DRG; sno429, sno202, and U6 in dhSC; sno202, sno420, and sno142 in mPFC. We provide the first reference genes' evaluation for miRNA normalization in different neuronal tissues in an animal model of peripheral nerve injury. Our results underline the need for careful selection of reference genes for miRNA normalization in different tissues and experimental conditions. We further anticipate that our findings can be used in a broad range of nerve injury related studies, to ensure validity and promote reproducibility in miRNA quantification.",Kai K Kummer;Miodrag Mitrić;Michaela Kress
566,Bin Yu,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a challenging clinical problem worldwide. The cellular state and molecular expression in spinal cord tissue after injury are extremely complex and closely related to functional recovery. However, the spatial and temporal changes of gene expression and regulation in various cell types after SCI are still unclear. Here, we collected the rostral and caudal regions to the lesion at 11 time points over a period of 28 days after rat hemisection SCI. Combining whole-transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spinal cord tissue from injured and sham-operated animals. Significantly altered biological processes were enriched from DEGs in astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, immune cells, and vascular systems after SCI. We then identified dynamic trends in these processes using the average expression profiles of DEGs. Gene expression and regulatory networks for selected biological processes were also constructed to illustrate the complicate difference between rostral and caudal tissues. Finally, we validated the expressions of some key genes from these networks, including α-synuclein, heme oxygenase 1, bone morphogenetic protein 2, activating transcription factor 3, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Collectively, we provided a comprehensive network of gene expression and regulation to shed light on the molecular characteristics of critical biological processes that occur after SCI, which will broaden the understanding of SCI and facilitate clinical therapeutics for SCI.",Chun Yao;Yongjun Wang;Susu Mao;Yaxian Wang;Ronghua Wu;Wei Feng;Yanping Chen;Jian Yang;Chengbin Xue;Dong Liu;Fei Ding;Xiaosong Gu
567,Michael Bader,"Serotonylation, the covalent linkage of serotonin to proteins has been discovered more than 60 years ago but only recently the mechanisms and first functions have been elucidated. It has been found that transglutaminases (TG) such as TG2 and the blood coagulation factor XIIIa are the enzymes which catalyze the linkage of serotonin and other monoamines to distinct glutamine (Gln) residues of target proteins. The first target proteins, small G-proteins and extracellular matrix constituents, were found in platelets and are pivotally involved in platelet aggregation and the formation of thrombi. The serotonylation of the same proteins is also involved in insulin secretion and in the proliferation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and thereby in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Recently histones have been described as targets of serotonylation opening the area of transcriptional control to this posttranslational protein modification. Future studies will certainly reveal further target proteins, signaling pathways, cellular processes, and diseases, in which serotonylation or, more general, monoaminylation is important.",
568,Ke Ma,"Voa protein is a subunit of V-ATPase proton pump which is essential to acidify intracellular organelles including synaptic vesicles. Voa1 is one of the four isoforms of Voa family with strong expression in neurons. Our present study was aimed to examine the role of Voa1 protein in mammalian brain neurons. To circumvent embryonic lethality, we generated conditional Voa1 knockout mice in which Voa1 was selectively deleted from forebrain pyramidal neurons. We performed experiments in the Voa1 knockout mice of ages 5-6 months to assess the persistent effects of Voa1 deletion. We found that the Voa1 knockout mice exhibited poor performance in the Morris water maze test compared to control mice. In addition, synaptic field potentials of the hippocampal CA1 region were greatly diminished in the Voa1 knockout mice when examined in brain slices in vitro. Furthermore, brain histological experiments showed severe degeneration of dorsal hippocampal CA1 neurons while CA3 neurons were largely preserved. The CA1 neurodegeneration was associated with general brain atrophy as overall hemispheric areas were reduced in the Voa1 cKO mice. Despite the CA1 degeneration and dysfunction, electroencephalographic recordings from the hippocampal CA3 area revealed aberrant spikes and non-convulsive discharges in the Voa1 knockout mice but not in control mice. These hippocampal spikes were suppressed by single intra-peritoneal injection of diazepam which is a benzodiazepine GABAA receptor enhancer. Together these results suggest that Voa1 related activities are essential for the survival of the targeted neurons in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 as well as other forebrain areas. We postulate that the Voa1 knockout mice may serve as a valuable model for further investigation of V-ATPase dysfunction related neuronal degeneration and functional abnormalities in forebrain areas particularly the hippocampus.",Na-Ryum Bin;Shan Shi;Hidekiyo Harada;Yoh Wada;Ge-Hong-Sun Wada;Philippe P Monnier;Shuzo Sugita;Liang Zhang
569,Adrien A Eshraghi,"Cochlear implantation (CI) is now widely used to provide auditory rehabilitation to individuals having severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, CI can lead to electrode insertion trauma (EIT) that can cause damage to sensory cells in the inner ear resulting in loss of residual hearing. Even with soft surgical techniques where there is minimal macroscopic damage, we can still observe the generation of molecular events that may initiate programmed cell death via various mechanisms such as oxidative stress, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and activation of the caspase pathway. In addition, individuals with CI may be exposed to noise trauma (NT) due to occupation and leisure activities that may affect their hearing ability. Recently, there has been an increased interest in the auditory community to determine the efficacy of drug-eluting electrodes for the protection of residual hearing. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of NT on implanted cochlea as well as the otoprotective efficacy of dexamethasone eluting electrode to implanted cochlea exposed to NT in a guinea pig model of CI. Animals were divided into five groups: EIT with dexamethasone eluting electrode exposed to NT; EIT exposed to NT; NT only; EIT only and naïve animals (control group). The hearing thresholds were determined by auditory brainstem recordings (ABRs). The cochlea was harvested and analyzed for transcript levels of inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis genes. We observed that threshold shifts were significantly higher in EIT, NT or EIT + NT groups compared to naive animals at all the tested frequencies. The dexamethasone eluting electrode led to a significant decrease in hearing threshold shifts in implanted animals exposed to NT. Proapoptotic tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α, TNF-α receptor 1a (TNFαR1a)] and pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ) genes were more than two-fold up-regulated following EIT and EIT + NT compared to the control group. The use of dexamethasone releasing electrode significantly decreased the transcript levels of pro-apoptotic and pro-fibrotic genes. The dexamethasone releasing electrode has shown promising results for hearing protection in implanted animals exposed to NT. The results of this study suggest that dexamethasone releasing electrode holds great potential in developing effective treatment modalities for NT in the implanted cochlea.",Amit Wolfovitz;Rasim Yilmazer;Carolyn Garnham;Ayca Baskadem Yilmazer;Esperanza Bas;Peter Ashman;Jonathan Roell;Jorge Bohorquez;Rahul Mittal;Roland Hessler;Daniel Sieber;Jeenu Mittal
570,Simon M Danner,"Commissural interneurons (CINs) mediate interactions between rhythm-generating locomotor circuits located on each side of the spinal cord and are necessary for left-right limb coordination during locomotion. While glutamatergic V3 CINs have been implicated in left-right coordination, their functional connectivity remains elusive. Here, we addressed this issue by combining experimental and modeling approaches. We employed Sim1Cre/+; Ai32 mice, in which light-activated Channelrhodopsin-2 was selectively expressed in V3 interneurons. Fictive locomotor activity was evoked by NMDA and 5-HT in the isolated neonatal lumbar spinal cord. Flexor and extensor activities were recorded from left and right L2 and L5 ventral roots, respectively. Bilateral photoactivation of V3 interneurons increased the duration of extensor bursts resulting in a slowed down on-going rhythm. At high light intensities, extensor activity could become sustained. When light stimulation was shifted toward one side of the cord, the duration of extensor bursts still increased on both sides, but these changes were more pronounced on the contralateral side than on the ipsilateral side. Additional bursts appeared on the ipsilateral side not seen on the contralateral side. Further increase of the stimulation could suppress the contralateral oscillations by switching to a sustained extensor activity, while the ipsilateral rhythmic activity remained. To delineate the function of V3 interneurons and their connectivity, we developed a computational model of the spinal circuits consisting of two (left and right) rhythm generators (RGs) interacting via V0V, V0D, and V3 CINs. Both types of V0 CINs provided mutual inhibition between the left and right flexor RG centers and promoted left-right alternation. V3 CINs mediated mutual excitation between the left and right extensor RG centers. These interactions allowed the model to reproduce our current experimental data, while being consistent with previous data concerning the role of V0V and V0D CINs in securing left-right alternation and the changes in left-right coordination following their selective removal. We suggest that V3 CINs provide mutual excitation between the spinal neurons involved in the control of left and right extensor activity, which may promote left-right synchronization during locomotion.",Han Zhang;Natalia A Shevtsova;Joanna Borowska-Fielding;Dylan Deska-Gauthier;Ilya A Rybak;Ying Zhang
571,Xiaojuan Su,"Pericytes are functional components of the neurovascular unit (NVU) that are located around the blood vessels, and their roles in the regulation of cerebral health and diseases has been reported. Currently, the potential properties of pericytes as emerging therapeutic targets for cerebrovascular diseases have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, few reviews have comprehensively discussed pericytes and their roles in cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, in this review, we not only summarized and described the basic characteristics of pericytes but also focused on clarifying the new understanding about the roles of pericytes in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases, including white matter injury (WMI), hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, depression, neovascular insufficiency disease, and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

572,Mathilde Cheray,"Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, play a major role in the maintenance of brain homeostasis and constantly screen the brain environment to detect any infection or damage. Once activated by a stimulus, microglial cells initiate an immune response followed by the resolution of brain inflammation. A failure or deviation in the housekeeping function of these guardian cells can lead to multiple diseases, including brain cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). A small number of studies have investigated the causal relation of both diseases, thereby revealing an inverse relationship where cancer patients have a reduced risk to develop AD and vice versa. In this review, we aim to shed light on the role of microglia in the fate to develop specifically glioma as one type of cancer or AD. We will examine the common and/or opposing genetic predisposition as well as associated pathways of these diseases to unravel a possible involvement of microglia in the occurrence of either disease. Lastly, a set of guidelines will be proposed for future research and diagnostics to clarify and improve the knowledge on the role of microglia in the decision toward one pathology or another.",Vassilis Stratoulias;Bertrand Joseph;Kathleen Grabert
573,Kazuya Honjoh,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes loss of normal sensation and often leads to debilitating neuropathic pain (NeP). Chronic NeP develops at or below the SCI lesion in as many as 80% of patients with SCI and may be induced by modulators of neuronal excitability released from activated microglia and macrophages. In the inflammatory response after SCI, different microglia/macrophage populations that are classically activated (M1 phenotype) or alternatively activated (M2 phenotype) have become of great interest. Chemokines have also recently attracted attention in neuron-microglia communication. CCL21 is a chemokine that activates microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) and is expressed only in neurons with an insult or mechanical injury. In this study using an SCI model in mutant (plt) mice with deficient CCL21 expression, we assessed post-SCI NeP and expression of microglia/macrophages and inflammatory cytokines at the injured site and lumbar enlargement. SCI-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulation were relieved in plt mice compared with those in wild-type (C57BL/6) mice, although there was no difference in motor function. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analysis showed that the phenotype of microglia/macrophages was M1 type-dominant in both types of mice at the lesion site and lumbar enlargement. A decrease of M1-type microglia/macrophages was seen in plt mice compared with wild-type, while the number of M2-type microglia/macrophages did not differ between these mice. In immunoblot analysis, expression of M1-induced cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ)] was decreased in plt mice, while that of M2-induced cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4, IL-10) did not differ in the two types of mice. The results of this study indicate that suppression of expression of inflammatory cytokines by decreasing the number of M1-type microglia/macrophages at the injured site and lumbar enlargement is associated with provision of an environment for reduction of NeP. These findings may be useful for the design of new therapies to alleviate NeP after SCI.",Hideaki Nakajima;Takayuki Hirai;Shuji Watanabe;Akihiko Matsumine
574,Gonzalo León-Espinosa,"Hibernating mammals undergo torpor periods characterized by a general decrease in body temperature, metabolic rate, and brain activity accompanied by complex adaptive brain changes that appear to protect the brain from extreme conditions of hypoxia and low temperatures. These processes are accompanied by morphological and neurochemical changes in the brain including those in cortical neurons such as the fragmentation and reduction of the Golgi apparatus (GA), which both reverse a few hours after arousal from the torpor state. In the present study, we characterized - by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy - the GA of cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells in the Syrian hamster, which is a facultative hibernator. We also show that after artificial induction of hibernation, in addition to neurons, the GA of glia in the Syrian hamster undergoes important structural changes, as well as modifications in the intensity of immunostaining and distribution patterns of Golgi structural proteins at different stages of the hibernation cycle.",Javier DeFelipe;Alberto Muñoz
575,Giulia De Bonis,"Cortical slow oscillations (≲1 Hz) are an emergent property of the cortical network that integrate connectivity and physiological features. This rhythm, highly revealing of the characteristics of the underlying dynamics, is a hallmark of low complexity brain states like sleep, and represents a default activity pattern. Here, we present a methodological approach for quantifying the spatial and temporal properties of this emergent activity. We improved and enriched a robust analysis procedure that has already been successfully applied to both in vitro and in vivo data acquisitions. We tested the new tools of the methodology by analyzing the electrocorticography (ECoG) traces recorded from a custom 32-channel multi-electrode array in wild-type isoflurane-anesthetized mice. The enhanced analysis pipeline, named SWAP (Slow Wave Analysis Pipeline), detects Up and Down states, enables the characterization of the spatial dependency of their statistical properties, and supports the comparison of different subjects. The SWAP is implemented in a data-independent way, allowing its application to other data sets (acquired from different subjects, or with different recording tools), as well as to the outcome of numerical simulations. By using the SWAP, we report statistically significant differences in the observed slow oscillations (SO) across cortical areas and cortical sites. Computing cortical maps by interpolating the features of SO acquired at the electrode positions, we give evidence of gradients at the global scale along an oblique axis directed from fronto-lateral toward occipito-medial regions, further highlighting some heterogeneity within cortical areas. The results obtained using the SWAP will be essential for producing data-driven brain simulations. A spatial characterization of slow oscillations will also trigger a discussion on the role of, and the interplay between, the different regions in the cortex, improving our understanding of the mechanisms of generation and propagation of delta rhythms and, more generally, of cortical properties.",Miguel Dasilva;Antonio Pazienti;Maria V Sanchez-Vives;Maurizio Mattia;Pier Stanislao Paolucci
576,Tzu-Yu Hsu,"Patient suffering of major depressive disorder (MDD) often complain that subjective time seems to ""drag"" with respect to physical time. This may point toward a generalized dysfunction of temporal processing in MDD. In the present study, we investigated temporal preparation in MDD. ""Temporal preparation"" refers to an increased readiness to act before an expected event; consequently, reaction time should be reduced. MDD patients and age-matched controls were required to make a saccadic eye movement between a central and an eccentric visual target after a variable duration preparatory period. We found that MDD patients produced a larger number of premature saccades, saccades initiated prior to the appearance of the expected stimulus. These saccades were not temporally controlled; instead, they seemed to reflect reduced inhibitory control causing oculomotor impulsivity. In contrast, the latency of visually guided saccades was strongly influenced by temporal preparation in controls; significantly less so, in MDD patients. This observed reduced temporal preparation in MDD was associated with a faster decay of short-term temporal memory. Moreover, in patients producing a lot of premature responses, temporal preparation to early imperative stimuli was increased. In conclusion, reduced temporal preparation and short-term temporal memory in the oculomotor domain supports the hypothesis that temporal processing was altered in MDD patients. Moreover, oculomotor impulsivity interacted with temporal preparation. These observed deficits could reflect other underlying aspects of abnormal time experience in MDD.",Hsin-Chien Lee;Timothy Joseph Lane;Marcus Missal
577,Azeez Adebimpe,"Movies that involve violence increasingly attract large audiences, leading to concern that such entertainment will encourage imitation by youth, especially when the violence is seen as justified. To assess differences between brain responses to justified and unjustified film violence, we computed intersubject correlation (ISC) of fMRI BOLD time courses in a sample of late adolescents while they watched pairs of movie segments featuring violent characters prior to and during violent action. Based on a virtue-ethics approach that emphasizes motives in moral evaluation, we hypothesized significant ISC in lateral orbital frontal cortex (lOFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in response to unjustified and justified scenes of movie violence, respectively. Our predictions were confirmed. In addition, unjustified violence elicited greater intersubject synchrony in insular cortex, consistent with an empathic response to the pain experienced by victims of this kind of violence. The results provide evidence supporting the notion that lOFC and vmPFC play unique roles in moral evaluation of violence, with lOFC becoming more synchronous in response to unacceptable violence and vmPFC becoming more synchronous in response to virtuous forms of self-defense, thereby expanding the purview of current models that only focus on vmPFC. The results suggest that justified violence in popular movies is acceptable to youth who are accustomed to viewing such entertainment.",Danielle S Bassett;Patrick E Jamieson;Daniel Romer
578,Ryan McKendrick,"Adaptive training and workload management have the potential to drastically change safety and productivity in high-risk fields-including, air-traffic control, missile defense, and nuclear power-plant operations. Quantifying and classifying cognitive load is important for optimal performance. Brain-based metrics have previously been associated with mental workload. Specifically, attenuation of prefrontal activity has been linked to cognitive overload, a cognitive load state associated with degraded task performance. We hypothesized that a similar nonlinearity would be observed for cognitive underload. When underload and overload effects are combined, they should form a cubic function in lateral prefrontal cortex as a function of working memory load. The first of two studies assessed the relationships between spatial working memory load with subjective, behavioral and hemodynamic measures. A cubic function was observed in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC; Brodmann's Area 46) relating working memory load to changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO). The second, two-part study tested the effects of workload transitions to different cognitive load states. Part-one replicated the effects observed in study one and identified transition points for individual performers. Part-two assessed the effects of transitioning to different cognitive load states. Cognitive load state transitions caused a deviation between behavioral measures and induced a significant change in the cubic function relating LDLPFC HbO and working memory load. From these observations, we present a hypothesis associating workload transitions with the disruption of cognitive process integration.",Amanda Harwood
579,Emily O'Dell Garnett,"Stuttering is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests as frequent disruptions in the flow of speech, affecting 1% of adults. Treatments are limited to behavioral interventions with variable success and high relapse rates, particularly in adults. However, even in severe cases, fluency can be temporarily induced during conditions in which the speaker synchronizes his speech with external rhythmic cues, such as when reading in unison (choral speech) or with a metronome. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown promise in augmenting the effects of behavioral treatment during motor and speech/language rehabilitation, but only one study to date has examined behavioral modulatory effects of tDCS in the context of stuttering. Using high-definition (HD)-tDCS electrodes, which improves focality of stimulation relative to conventional tDCS, we investigated the effects of tDCS on speech fluency and brain activation in 14 adults who stutter (AWS). Either anodal or sham stimulation was delivered on separate days over left supplementary motor area (SMA). During stimulation, participants read aloud in sync with a metronome. Measures of speech fluency and brain activity functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were collected before and after stimulation. No significant differences in brain activity or speech fluency were found when comparing active and sham stimulation. However, stuttering severity significantly modulated the effect of stimulation: active stimulation attenuated the atypically strong association between stuttering severity and right thalamocortical network activity, especially in more severe speakers. These preliminary results warrant additional research into potential application of HD-tDCS to modulate speech motor networks to enhance fluency in stuttering.",Ho Ming Chow;Ai Leen Choo;Soo-Eun Chang
580,Shaowei Jin,"Object recognition in containers is extremely difficult for robots. Dynamic audio signals are more responsive to an object's internal property. Therefore, we adopt the dynamic contact method to collect acoustic signals in the container and recognize objects in containers. Traditional machine learning is to recognize objects in a closed environment, which is not in line with practical applications. In real life, exploring objects is dynamically changing, so it is necessary to develop methods that can recognize all classes of objects in an open environment. A framework for recognizing objects in containers using acoustic signals in an open environment is proposed, and then the kernel k nearest neighbor algorithm in an open environment (OSKKNN) is set. An acoustic dataset is collected, and the feasibility of the method is verified on the dataset, which greatly promotes the recognition of objects in an open environment. And it also proves that the use of acoustic to recognize objects in containers has good value.",Huaping Liu;Bowen Wang;Fuchun Sun

583,Kyan Younes,"Hepatic encephalopathy and hyperammonemia are common in the setting of liver disease and have been associated with both generalized and focal neurological deficits. We report a case of hepatic encephalopathy with transaminitis in the setting of hyperammonemia clinically mimicking acute dominant middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome. A 59-year-old right-handed woman had new-onset expressive aphasia, left gaze deviation, and right hemiparesis consistent with MCA stroke. Her symptoms began 12 h after transarterial chemoembolization, a procedure to embolize blood supply and provide cytotoxic agents to a hepatocellular carcinoma tumor. Thrombocytopenia and age-indeterminate hypodensities on brain CT precluded intravenous thrombolytic administration. MRI revealed predominantly dominant hemisphere subcortical restricted diffusion with no cortical involvement. Due to a mismatch between the MRI findings and the neurological symptoms, she underwent digital subtraction cerebral angiography to assess candidacy for intra-arterial thrombectomy, which revealed completely patent MCAs with intact filling of the distal branches. Liver enzymes and ammonia were elevated. The patient was treated with lactulose and intravenous fluids. After normalization of liver enzymes, the patient's neurological deficits resolved. Reversal of this patient's focal symptoms with medical management could potentially be explained by the recovery of blood flow-metabolic demand mismatch caused by worsening liver dysfunction and hyperammonemia. As acute stroke therapies and interventions increase in utility for large artery acute ischemic stroke, it is vital to recognize hepatic encephalopathy and liver failure as part of the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with MCA syndrome.",Nicole R Gonzales;Amrou Sarraj;Eliana Bonfante;Amanda Jagolino-Cole
584,Keita Yamauchi,"Bleeding from a dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) typically occurs in the form of an intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Here, we report a rare case of a DAVF with an acute subdural hematoma (ASDH). A 29-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a complaint of progressing headache and nausea, with no reported episode of head trauma. Non-contrast CT revealed a left ASDH with a moderate midline shift. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a DAVF on the left parietal convexity. The DAVF was fed by the middle meningeal artery and drained into the superior sagittal sinus and the sphenoparietal sinus via the diploic vein without cortical venous reflux. The DAVF was treated with transarterial embolization using 25% diluted n-butyl cyanoacrylate prior to hematoma removal. The bleeding point was confirmed on the inner surface of the dura mater. The patient recovered well without any neurological deficits.",Shunsuke Takenaka;Tomohiro Iida;Hideki Sakai

After complete etiological study, two cranial pseudoaneurysms were observed in the cerebral angiography. Endovascular treatment was successfully completed, achieving full embolization without complications. No rebleeding was detected during follow-up. The patient had a good clinical outcome at 3 months and achieved complete recovery.

587,Kim M Gruver,"Optogenetics is a state-of-the-art tool for interrogating neural circuits. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells serve as the sole output of the cerebellar cortex where they synapse on neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). To investigate the properties of this synaptic connection, we sought to elicit time-locked single action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. Using optical stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing Purkinje cells combined with patch-clamp recordings of Purkinje cells and DCN neurons in acute cerebellar slices, we determine the photostimulation parameters required to elicit single time-locked action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. We show that axons require longer light pulses than somata do to elicit single action potentials and that Purkinje cell axons are also more susceptible to light perturbations. We then demonstrate that these empirically determined photostimulation parameters elicit time-locked synaptic currents from postsynaptic cells in the DCN. Our results highlight the importance of optimizing optogenetic stimulation conditions to interrogate synaptic connections.",Alanna J Watt
588,John F Wesseling,"The connection strength of most chemical synapses changes dynamically during normal use as a function of the recent history of activity. The phenomenon is known as short-term synaptic plasticity or synaptic dynamics, and is thought to be involved in processing and filtering information as it is transmitted across the synaptic cleft. Multiple presynaptic mechanisms have been implicated, but large gaps remain in our understanding of how the mechanisms are modulated and how they interact. One important factor is the timing of recruitment of synaptic vesicles to a readily-releasable pool. A number of studies have concluded that activity and/or residual Ca2+ can accelerate the mechanism, but alternative explanations for some of the evidence have emerged. Here I review the methodology that we have developed for isolating the recruitment and the dependence on activity from other kinds of mechanisms that are activated concurrently.",
589,Jorge Ojeda,"The development of the brain is shaped by a myriad of factors among which neurotransmitters play remarkable roles before and during the formation and maturation of synaptic circuits. Cellular processes such as neurogenesis, morphological development, synaptogenesis and maturation of synapses are temporary and spatially regulated by the local or distal influence of neurotransmitters in the developing cortex. Thus, research on this area has contributed to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of brain development and to shed light on the etiology of various human neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome (RTT), among others. Recently, the field of neuroscience has been shaken by an explosive advance of experimental approaches linked to the use of induced pluripotent stem cells and reprogrammed neurons. This new technology has allowed researchers for the first time to model in the lab the unique events that take place during early human brain development and to explore the mechanisms that cause synaptopathies. In this context, the role of neurotransmitters during early stages of cortex development is beginning to be re-evaluated and a revision of the state of the art has become necessary in a time when new protocols are being worked out to differentiate stem cells into functional neurons. New perspectives on reconsidering the function of neurotransmitters include opportunities for methodological advances, a better understanding of the origin of mental disorders and the potential for development of new treatments.",Ariel Ávila
590,Jessica Oschwald,"Age-related differences in white matter (WM) microstructure have been linked to lower performance in tasks of processing speed in healthy older individuals. However, only few studies have examined this link in a longitudinal setting. These investigations have been limited to the correlation of simultaneous changes in WM microstructure and processing speed. Still little is known about the nature of age-related changes in WM microstructure, i.e., regionally distinct vs. global changes. In the present study, we addressed these open questions by exploring whether previous changes in WM microstructure were related to subsequent changes in processing speed: (a) 1 year later; or (b) 2 years later. Furthermore, we investigated whether age-related changes in WM microstructure were regionally specific or global. We used data from four occasions (covering 4 years) of the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database project (N = 232; age range at baseline = 64-86). As a measure of WM microstructure, we used mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in 10 major WM tracts averaged across hemispheres. Processing speed was measured with four cognitive tasks. Statistical analyses were conducted with bivariate latent change score (LCS) models. We found, for the first time, evidence for lagged couplings between preceding changes in FA and subsequent changes in processing speed 2 years, but not 1 year later in some of the WM tracts (anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus). Our results supported the notion that FA changes were different between regional WM tracts rather than globally shared, with some tracts showing mean declines in FA, and others remaining relatively stable across 4 years.",Susan Mérillat;Franziskus Liem;Christina Röcke;Mike Martin;Lutz Jäncke
591,Manuela Adcock,"Aging is associated with sensory, motor and cognitive impairments that may lead to reduced daily life functioning including gait disturbances, falls, injuries and mobility restrictions. A strong need exists for implementing effective evidence-based interventions for healthy aging. Therefore, the aim of this study was to (i) evaluate the feasibility and usability of an in-home multicomponent exergame training and (ii) explore its effects on physical functions, cognition and cortical activity. Twenty-one healthy and independently living older adults were included (11 female, 74.4 ± 7.0 years, range: 65-92 years) and performed 24 trainings sessions (each 40 min) over eight weeks. The first part was conducted in a living lab (home-like laboratory environment), the second part at participants' home. The multicomponent exergame included Tai Chi-inspired exercises, dance movements and step-based cognitive games to train strength, balance and cognition. Attendance and attrition rates were calculated and safety during training was evaluated to determine feasibility. Participants rated the usability of the exergame (System Usability Scale) and reported on their game experience (Game Experience Questionnaire). Physical and cognitive functions and cortical activity (resting state electroencephalopathy) were assessed pre and post intervention. Results showed a high training attendance rate for the living lab and the home-based setting (91.7 and 91.0%, respectively) with a rather high attrition rate (28.6%, six drop-outs). Half of the drop-out reasons were related to personal or health issues. System usability was rated acceptable with a mean score of 70.6/100. Affective game experience was rated favorable. Significant improvements were found for minimal toe clearance, short-term attentional span, and information processing speed (p < 0.05). No significant pre-post differences were found for cortical activity. To summarize, the exergame is generally feasible and usable for healthy older adults applied in an in-home setting and provides an overall positive emotional game experience. Nevertheless, flawless technical functionality should be a mandatory consideration. Additionally, the training might have potential positive influence on specific functions in older adults. However, the efficacy has to be evaluated in a future randomized controlled trial assessing the behavioral and neuroplastic changes in a larger population after a longer training period.",Melanie Thalmann;Alexandra Schättin;Federico Gennaro;Eling D de Bruin
592,Anushka Chakravorty,"Neurons are highly specialized post-mitotic cells that are inherently dependent on mitochondria owing to their high bioenergetic demand. Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore associated with various age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), wherein accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria has been reported as an early symptom further contributing to disease progression. In AD, impairment of mitochondrial function causes bioenergetic deficiency, intracellular calcium imbalance and oxidative stress, thereby aggravating the effect of Aβ and tau pathologies, leading to synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment and memory loss. Although there are reports suggesting intricate parallelism between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD pathologies such as Aβ aggregation and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation, the factors that drive the pathogenesis of either are unclear. In addition, emerging evidence suggest that mitochondrial quality control (QC) mechanisms such as mitophagy are impaired in AD. As an important mitochondrial QC mechanism, mitophagy plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal health and function. Studies show that various proteins involved in mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial biogenesis are affected in AD. Compromised mitophagy may also be attributed to impairment in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and defects in lysosomal acidification. Therapeutic interventions aiming to restore mitophagy functions can be used as a strategy for ameliorating AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence implicates the role of microglial activation via mitophagy induction in reducing amyloid plaque load. This review summarizes the current developments in the field of mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.",Cuckoo Teresa Jetto;Ravi Manjithaya
593,Li Wang,"Age-related neurodegenerative and neurochemical changes are considered to be the basis for the decline of motor function; however, the change of effective connections in cortical motor networks that come with aging remains unclear. Here, we investigated the age-related changes of the dynamic interaction between cortical motor regions. Twenty young subjects and 20 older subjects underwent both right hand motor execution (ME) and right hand motor imagery (MI) tasks by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) was used to compare young and older adults' effective connectivity among regions of the motor network during the tasks. The more effective connections among motor regions in older adults were found during ME; however, effective within-domain hemisphere connections were reduced, and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal was significantly delayed in older adults during MI. Supplementary motor area (SMA) had a significantly higher In+Out degree within the network during ME and MI in older adults. Our results revealed a dynamic interaction within the motor network altered with aging during ME and MI, which suggested that the interaction with cortical motor neurons caused by the mental task was more difficult with aging. The age-related effects on the motor cortical network provide a new insight into our understanding of neurodegeneration in older individuals.",Ye Zhang;Jingna Zhang;Linqiong Sang;Pengyue Li;Rubing Yan;Mingguo Qiu;Chen Liu
594,Xinjie Chen,"Objective: To investigate changes in brain function at the regional and whole-brain levels in patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (TDPD) complicated by sleep disorder (SD) by regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) analysis of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance images. Materials and Methods: ReHo and seed-based FC analyses were conducted among 32 patients with TDPD and SD (TDPD-SD), 24 with TDPD and no SD (TDPD-NSD), and 23 healthy controls (HCs) to assess spontaneous brain activity and network-level brain function. Correlation analyses were used to examine the associations between brain activity and the clinical data. Results: Anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) ReHo values differed significantly among the groups. ACC ReHo values were increased in TDPD-SD vs. HC and TDPD-SD vs. TDPD-NSD. ACC ReHo values were reduced in TDPD-NSD vs. HC. TDPD-SD ReHo values were positively correlated with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores (r = 0.41, p = 0.020) but negatively correlated with Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) scores (r = -0.38, p = 0.030). FC analysis using ACC as a mask showed that FC of the left olfactory cortex (L-OC), right straight gyrus (R-SG), right superior parietal gyrus (R-SPG), and right precuneus differed significantly among the groups. FC values between R-SG and ACC were significantly lower in TDPD-SD than in TDPD-NSD, while the FC of L-OC and R-OC with ACC was significantly lower in TDPD-SD than in HC. FC between ACC and L-OC, R-SPG, and the right precuneus was lower in TDPD-NSD than in HC. There was no correlation between the FC values and other clinical data in any of the groups. Conclusion: Localized abnormal activity in TDPD-SD was chiefly triggered by ACC. The change in the ReHo of ACC is closely related to the severity of TDPD-associated SD, revealing the role of this region as a regulator of the sleep mechanism in TDPD. Significant abnormal FC was found between R-SG and ACC in TDPD-SD but was not shown to correlate with clinical data.",Xiaoyan Hou;Xiaodong Luo;Sifan Zhou;Xian Liu;Bo Liu;Jun Chen
595,Mercedes Arnes,"Multiple neurological, physiological, and behavioral functions are synchronized by circadian clocks into daily rhythms. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies are associated with a decay of circadian rhythms, disruption of sleep patterns, and impaired cognitive function but the mechanisms underlying these alterations are still unclear. Traditional approaches in neurodegeneration research have focused on understanding how pathology impinges on circadian function. Since in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies tau proteostasis is compromised, here we sought to understand the role of tau protein in neuronal circadian biology and related behavior. Considering molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms are conserved from Drosophila to humans, here we took advantage of a recently developed tau-deficient Drosophila line to show that loss of tau promotes dysregulation of daily circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Strikingly, tau deficiency dysregulates the structural plasticity of the small ventral lateral circadian pacemaker neurons by disrupting the temporal cytoskeletal remodeling of its dorsal axonal projections and by inducing a slight increase in the cytoplasmic accumulation of core clock proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of tau function participates in the regulation of circadian rhythms by modulating the correct operation and connectivity of core circadian networks and related behavior.",Maria E Alaniz;Caline S Karam;Joshua D Cho;Gonzalo Lopez;Jonathan A Javitch;Ismael Santa-Maria
596,Carmit Gal,"The acquisition and retention of motor skills is necessary for everyday functioning in the elderly and may be critical in the context of motor rehabilitation. Recent studies indicate that motor training closely followed by sleep may result in better engagement of procedural (""how to"") memory consolidation processes in the elderly. Nevertheless, elderly individuals are mostly morning oriented and a common practice is to time rehabilitation programs to morning hours. Here, we tested whether the time-of-day wherein training is afforded (morning, 8-10:30 a.m., or evening, 6-9 p.m.) affects the long-term outcome of a multi-session motor practice program (10 sessions across 3-4 weeks) in healthy elderly participants. Twenty-nine (15 women) older adults (60-75 years) practiced an explicitly instructed five-element key-press sequence by repeatedly generating the sequence ""as fast and accurately as possible."" The groups did not differ in terms of sleep habits and quality (1-week long actigraphy); all were morning-oriented individuals. All participants gained robustly from the intervention, shortening sequence tapping duration and retaining the gains (> 90%) at 1-month post-intervention, irrespective of the time-of-day of training. However, retesting at 7-months post-intervention showed that the attrition of the training induced gains was more pronounced in the morning trained group compared to the evening group (76 and 56.5% loss in sequence tapping time; 7/14 and 3/14 participants showed a > 5% decline in accuracy relative to end of training, respectively). Altogether, the results show that morning-oriented older adults effectively acquired skill in the performance of a sequence of finger movements, in both morning and evening practice sessions. However, evening training leads to a significant advantage, over morning training, in the long-term retention of the skill. Evening training should be considered an appropriate time window for motor skill learning in older adults, even in individuals with morning chronotype. The results are in line with the notion that motor training preceding a sleep interval may be better consolidated into long-term memory in the elderly, and thus result in lower forgetting rates.",Ella Gabitov;Rinatia Maaravi-Hesseg;Avi Karni;Maria Korman
597,Shunsuke Kobayashi,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, localizing mainly in the axon of mature neurons. Phenotypic analysis of Tau knockout mice has revealed an impairment of synaptic plasticity but without gross changes in brain morphology. Since we previously described the presence of tau mRNA in the somatodendritic compartment, including the postsynapse, and demonstrated that it could be locally translated in response to glutamate, it appears that the regulated translation of synaptic tau can have a direct impact on synaptic function. Using SH-SY5Y cells, we herein confirm that glutamate dose-dependently regulates the translation of tau protein without altering tau mRNA levels. This is supported by the finding that cycloheximide blocks glutamate-stimulated increases in tau protein levels. Our observation that neural excitation can directly upregulate tau mRNA translation helps explain the pathological accumulation of tau in the somatodendrite.",Toru Tanaka;Yoshiyuki Soeda;Akihiko Takashima
598,Qi Feng,"Background: Recent evidence suggests the presence of hippocampal neuroanatomical abnormalities in subjects of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Our study aimed to identify the radiomic biomarkers of the hippocampus for building the classification models in aMCI diagnosis. Methods: For this target, we recruited 42 subjects with aMCI and 44 normal controls (NC). The right and left hippocampi were segmented for each subject using an efficient learning-based method. Then, the radiomic analysis was applied to calculate and select the radiomic features. Finally, two logistic regression models were built based on the selected features obtained from the right and left hippocampi. Results: There were 385 features derived after calculation, and four features remained after feature selection from each group of data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, precision, recall, and F-score of the classification evaluation index of the right hippocampus logistic regression model were 0.76, 0.71, 0.69, 0.69, 0.71, 0.69, 0.69, and 0.69, and those of the left hippocampus model were 0.79, 0.71, 0.54, 0.64, 0.63, 0.64, 0.54, and 0.58, respectively. Conclusion: Results demonstrate the potential hippocampal radiomic biomarkers are valid for the aMCI diagnosis.

599,Seyedamirhosein Motamedi,"Neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases regularly cause optic nerve and retinal damage. Evaluating retinal changes using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in diseases like multiple sclerosis has thus become increasingly relevant. However, intraretinal segmentation, a necessary step for interpreting retinal changes in the context of these diseases, is not standardized and often requires manual correction. Here we present a semi-automatic intraretinal layer segmentation pipeline and establish normative values for retinal layer thicknesses at the macula, including dependencies on age, sex, and refractive error. Spectral domain OCT macular 3D volume scans were obtained from healthy participants using a Heidelberg Engineering Spectralis OCT. A semi-automated segmentation tool (SAMIRIX) based on an interchangeable third-party segmentation algorithm was developed and employed for segmentation, correction, and thickness computation of intraretinal layers. Normative data is reported from a 6 mm Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) circle around the fovea. An interactive toolbox for the normative database allows surveying for additional normative data. We cross-sectionally evaluated data from 218 healthy volunteers (144 females/74 males, age 36.5 ± 12.3 years, range 18-69 years). Average macular thickness (MT) was 313.70 ± 12.02 μm, macular retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (mRNFL) 39.53 ± 3.57 μm, ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer thickness (GCIPL) 70.81 ± 4.87 μm, and inner nuclear layer thickness (INL) 35.93 ± 2.34 μm. All retinal layer thicknesses decreased with age. MT and GCIPL were associated with sex, with males showing higher thicknesses. Layer thicknesses were also positively associated with each other. Repeated-measurement reliability for the manual correction of automatic intraretinal segmentation results was excellent, with an intra-class correlation coefficient >0.99 for all layers. The SAMIRIX toolbox can simplify intraretinal segmentation in research applications, and the normative data application may serve as an expandable reference for studies, in which normative data cannot be otherwise obtained.",Kay Gawlik;Noah Ayadi;Hanna G Zimmermann;Susanna Asseyer;Charlotte Bereuter;Janine Mikolajczak;Friedemann Paul;Ella Maria Kadas;Alexander Ulrich Brandt
600,Anetta Lasek-Bal,"Introduction: The aim of this project was to assess the prevalence of four selected SNPs rs4977574 and rs7857345 (CDKN2B-AS1 gene) and rs3798220 and rs10455872 polymorphisms (the LPA gene) in the subpopulation of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Material and Methods: This study included 623 individuals (244 patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, 176 patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and 203 healthy people. All the participants underwent neurological examination, duplex Doppler ultrasound examination and molecular procedures. Results: In the first part of the analysis the assiociation of SNPs with stroke/TIA was investigated. The association was seen in symptomatic vs. control group for two SNPs: rs4977574 and rs7857345 (CDKN2B-AS1 gene); genotype distributions for rs4977574 and rs7857345 showed the statistically significant differences between patients and controls (p = 0.043 and 0.017, respectively). No association was observed for rs3798220 and rs10455872 located in the LPA gene. There were statistically significant differences between asymptomatic patients vs. control group in genotype distribution for the SNPs located in CDKN2B-AS1: rs4977574 and rs7857345 (p = 0.031 and 0.0099, respectively); and for the rs3798220 (LPA gene; p = 0.003); however, statistically significant differences did not occur for the rs10455872 polymorphism located in the LPA gene. In the next part of the evaluation, a comparison between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was performed. Significant differences in genotype distribution were seen only for the rs3798220 polymorphism located in the LPA gene (p = 0.0015). The analysis of the prevalence of the polymorphisms in the total group (symptomatic and asymptomatic) patients in comparison with the control group showed significant differences for three polymorphisms: rs4977574 and rs7857345 (CDKN2B-AS1 gene; p = 0.015 and 0.0046, respectively) and rs3798220 (LPA gene, p = 0.044). Conclusions: The present research on the carotid artery stenosis patient cohort suggests the significant association between the rs4977574, rs7857345 and rs3798220 polymorphisms and carotid artery stenosis as well as between the rs4977574 and rs7857345 polymorphisms and atherogenic stroke.

601,Marinela Vavla,"Introduction: In-vivo objective documentation of pathological changes in neurodegenerative disease is a major aim to possibly improve our ability to monitor disease progression and response to treatment. Temporal thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness shown by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) has been reported in association with the complex forms in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). We performed an assessment of the RNFL thickness in a group of HSP patients, including a longitudinal follow-up in a subgroup. Our aim was to measure and compare the changes and correlate them to clinical progression. Materials and Methods: Twenty-three HSP patients were recruited and studied with the SD-OCT including papillary and macular scan by Spectralis. The clinical severity was assessed using the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale. Results: Thinning of the superior, nasal and inferior quadrants bilaterally were observed compared to the normative data in both pure and complicated forms, that were clearly pathological only in a proportion of cases. Thinning correlated with age and disease duration, but not with clinical severity. The longitudinal study (n = 9) showed no significant change compared to the baseline data for the period of observation (mean 10.7 months). Conclusions: RFNL is frequently thinned in HSP with no specific recognizable pattern of quadrants involved and SPG types. The small sample size and the short follow-up time showed no clear progression. Although SD-OCT appraisal of RFNL deserves to be explored in neurodegenerative conditions, it might not be suitable for use as a biomarker in HSP as it appears not to be specific to this condition and can be a feature of aging.",Gabriella Paparella;Alessandro Papayannis;Riccardo Pascuzzo;Giulia Girardi;Francesco Pellegrini;Gianluca Capello;Gianni Prosdocimo;Andrea Martinuzzi

603,Mariana Dutra Brito,"Background: The development of strategies that could not only efficiently detect the onset of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with no cure but also predict its development and evaluate therapeutic intervention would be of great value. In this respect, the metabolic status of ALS patients has called attention. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the potential correlation between changes in ALS's metabolic parameters with the disease outcome in a systematic review. Methods: The manuscripts were manually searched within different databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane). The inclusion criteria were original articles and reviews about individuals with ALS and its survival, disease prognosis and metabolism (weight, cholesterol, hypertension, BMI, and glycaemia). The authors also established three different exclusion criteria: studies including ALS and other degenerative disorders, works including animal models and published before the year 2000. Results: In total, 29 papers were selected. From all manuscripts, only 82.8% ensured the participation of sALS patients. Also, 27.6% of selected studies described the presence of a genetic mutation. Regarding ALS prognosis, patient's age, the age of ALS onset, ALS duration and survival, <50% of the papers addressed these issues. Specifically, regarding metabolism, 65.5% of articles mentioned BMI, 20.7% mentioned any data concerning hypertension, 6.89% cardiovascular risk, 10.3% obesity, 13.78% diabetes and 10.3% glycaemia. Concerning lipid metabolism, more results were gathered, but still, they did not suffice to establish a correlation with ALS development. Conclusions: Altogether, the authors concluded that available information is not enough to establish a link between ALS and metabolism. In reality, less than half of the manuscripts evaluated show an association between both factors. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that metabolism does influence ALS, but not in a unique manner. There is a debate about patients' hypo- and hypermetabolism. Thus, to provide a reliable record, a public policy in which all research and clinical centers might assess the parameters discussed herein is suggested. Accordingly, this systematic review attempts to provide a comprehensible database to facilitate multicentered collaboration, validation, and clinical translation.",Gustavo Ferro Gomes da Silva;Erick Mutti Tilieri;Beatriz Grisolia Araujo;Michele Longoni Calió;Tatiana Rosado Rosenstock
604,Sara Isernia,"Background: The recent exponential growth of Digital Health (DH) in the healthcare system provides a crucial transformation in healthcare, answering to alarming threats related to the increasing number of Chronic Neurological Diseases (CNDs). New long-term integrated DH-care approaches, including rehabilitation, are warranted to address these concerns. Methods: The Human Empowerment Aging and Disability (HEAD) rehabilitation program, a new long-term integrated care including DH-care system, was evaluated in terms of efficiency and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in 107 CND patients (30 with Parkinson's Disease, PD; 32 with Multiple Sclerosis, MS; 45 with stroke in chronic stage). All participants followed 1-month of HEAD rehabilitation in clinic (ClinicHEAD: 12 sessions, 3/week), then 1:3 patient was consecutively allocated to 3-months telerehabilitation at home (HomeHEAD: 60 sessions, 5/week). Efficiency (i.e., adherence, usability, and acceptability) and PROMs (i.e., perceived functioning in real-world) were analyzed. Results: The rate of adherence to HEAD treatment in clinic (≥90%) and at home (77%) was high. Usability of HEAD system was judged as good (System Usability Scale, median 70.00) in clinic and even more at home (median 80.00). Similarly, administering the Technology Acceptance Model 3 questionnaire we found high scores both in clinic/at home (Usefulness, mean 5.39 ± 1.41 SD/mean 5.33 ± 1.29 SD; Ease of use, mean 5.55 ± 1.05 SD/ mean 5.45 ± 1.17 SD, External Control, mean 4.94 ± 1.17 SD/mean 5.07 ± 1.01 SD, Relevance, mean 5.68 ± 1.29 SD/mean 5.70 ± 1.13 SD and Enjoyment, mean 5.70 ± 1.40 SD/mean 6.01 ± 1.08 SD). After ClinicHEAD, participation and autonomy in daily routine was maintained or even ameliorated (PD and stroke > MS). Whereas, increased functionality and participation in the MS group was found only after HomeHEAD intervention. Discussion: Our results suggest that a tele-health-based approach is both feasible and efficient in providing rehabilitation care to CNDs from clinic to home. Increasing and maintaining participation as well as autonomy in daily routine are promising findings that open up scenarios for the continuity of care at home through DH-care for CNDs.",Chiara Pagliari;Johanna Jonsdottir;Carlotta Castiglioni;Patrizia Gindri;Cristina Gramigna;Giovanna Palumbo;Marco Salza;Franco Molteni;Francesca Baglio; 
605,Giorgi Kuchukhidze,"Background: Language function may be reorganized in patients with malformations of cortical development (MCD). This prospective cohort study aimed in assessing language dominance in a large group of patients with MCD and epilepsy using functional MRI (fMRI). Methods: Sixty-eight patients (40 women) aged 10-73 years (median, 28.0; interquartile range, 19) with MCD and epilepsy underwent 1.5 T MRI and fMRI (word generation task). Single-subject image analysis was performed with statistical parametric mapping (SPM12). Language lateralization indices (LIs) were defined for statistically significantly activated voxels in Broca's and Wernicke's areas using the formula: LI = (V L - V R)/(V L + V R) × 100, where V L and V R were sets of activated voxels on the left and on the right, respectively. Language laterality was considered typical if LI was between +20 and +100 or atypical if LI was between +19 and -100. Results: fMRI signal was elicited in 55 of 68 (81%) patients. In 18 of 55 (33%) patients, language dominance was typical, and in 37 of 55 (67%) patients, atypical (in 68%, right hemispheric; in 32%, bilateral). Language dominance was not influenced by handedness, electroclinical, and imaging features. Conclusions: In this prospective study on a large group of patients with MCD and epilepsy, about two-thirds had atypical language dominance. These results may contribute to assessing risks of postsurgical language deficits and could assist in planning of ""cortical mapping"" with intracranial electrodes in patients who undergo presurgical assessment.",Christian Siedentopf;Iris Unterberger;Florian Koppelstaetter;Martin Kronbichler;Laura Zamarian;Edda Haberlandt;Anja Ischebeck;Margarete Delazer;Stephan Felber;Eugen Trinka
606,Maram Aljuaid,"Background: The forefront treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is Levodopa. When patients are treated with Levodopa cerebral blood flow is increased while cerebral metabolic rate is decreased in key subcortical regions including the putamen. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in patients with Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Method: To study the effect of clinically-determined anti-parkinsonian medications, 10 PD patients (5 with LID and 5 without LID) have been scanned with FDG-PET (a probe for glucose metabolism) and perfusion MRI (a probe for cerebral blood flow) both when they are ON and OFF medications. Patients additionally underwent resting state fMRI to detect changes in dopamine-mediated cortico-striatal connectivity. The degree of blood flow-glucose metabolism dissociation was quantified by comparing the FDG-PET and perfusion MRI data. Results: A significant interaction effect (imaging modality × medication; blood flow-glucose metabolism dissociation) has been found in the putamen (p = 0.023). Post-hoc analysis revealed that anti-parkinsonian medication consistently normalized the pathologically hyper-metabolic state of the putamen while mixed effects were observed in cerebral blood flow changes. This dissociation was especially predominant in patients with LID compared to those without. Unlike the prior study, this differentiation was not observed when cortico-striatal functional connectivity was assessed. Conclusion: We confirmed striatal neurovascular dissociation between FDG-PET and perfusion MRI in response to clinically determined anti-parkinsonian medication. We further proposed a novel analytical method to quantify the degree of dissociation in the putamen using only the ON condition scans, Putamen-to-thalamus Hyper-perfusion/hypo-metabolism Index (PHI), which may have the potential to be used as a biomarker for LID (correctly classifying 8 out 10 patients). For wider use of PHI, a larger validation study is warranted.",Samuel Booth;Douglas E Hobson;Andrew Borys;Kelly Williams;Audrey Katako;Lawrence Ryner;Andrew L Goertzen;Ji Hyun Ko
607,Valeria Prada,"Nerve biopsy represents the conclusive step in the diagnostic work-up of peripheral neuropathies, and its diagnostic yield is still debated. The aim of this study is to consider the impact of nerve biopsy on reaching a useful diagnosis in different peripheral neuropathies and its changing over time. We retrospectively analyzed 1,179 sural nerve biopsies performed in the period 1981-2017 at Neurological Clinic of Policlinico San Martino (Genoa). We relied on medical records and collected both clinical and pathological data in a database. Biopsy provided univocal diagnoses in 53% of cases (with an increase over time), multiple diagnostic options in 14%, while diagnosis was undetermined in 33% (undetermined reports decreased during the years). In 57% of patients, the pre-biopsy suspicion was confirmed, while in 43% sural biopsy modified the clinical diagnosis. The highest yield was in axonal neuropathies (29% undetermined reports vs. 40% in demyelinating and 48% in mixed neuropathies). In 68% of patients with vasculitic neuropathy, this etiology was already suspected, whereas in 32% nerve biopsy modified the clinical diagnosis. During the years, the number of annually performed biopsies decreased significantly (p = 0.007), with an increase in the mean age of patients (p < 0.0001). The percentage of hereditary neuropathies had a significant decrease (p = 0.016), while the rate of vasculitic and chronic inflammatory neuropathies increased (p < 0.0001). This is the largest Italian study addressing the yield of sural nerve biopsy. During the years, we observed a progressive refinement of the indication of this procedure, which confirms its utility for interstitial neuropathies, particularly if non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy is suspected.",Sara Massucco;Consuelo Venturi;Alessandro Geroldi;Emilia Bellone;Paola Mandich;Michele Minuto;Emanuela Varaldo;Giovanni Mancardi;Marina Grandis;Angelo Schenone
608,Christiane D Much,"Autosomal dominant cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) represents a genetic disorder with a high mutation detection rate given that stringent inclusion criteria are used and copy number variation analyses are part of the diagnostic workflow. Pathogenic variants in either CCM1 (KRIT1), CCM2 or CCM3 (PDCD10) can be identified in 87-98% of CCM families with at least two affected individuals. However, the interpretation of novel sequence variants in the 5'-region of CCM2 remains challenging as there are various alternatively spliced transcripts and different transcription start sites. Comprehensive genetic and clinical data of CCM2 patients with variants in cassette exons that are either skipped or included into alternative CCM2 transcripts in the splicing process can significantly facilitate clinical variant interpretation. We here report novel pathogenic CCM2 variants in exon 3 and the adjacent donor splice site, describe the natural history of CCM disease in mutation carriers and provide further evidence for the classification of the amino acids encoded by the nucleotides of this cassette exon as a critical region within CCM2. Finally, we illustrate the advantage of a combined single nucleotide and copy number variation detection approach in NGS-based CCM1/CCM2/CCM3 gene panel analyses which can significantly reduce diagnostic turnaround time.",Konrad Schwefel;Dariush Skowronek;Loay Shoubash;Felix von Podewils;Miriam Elbracht;Stefanie Spiegler;Ingo Kurth;Agnes Flöel;Henry W S Schroeder;Ute Felbor;Matthias Rath
609,Marta Allena,"Introduction: Cluster Headache (CH) is a well-characterized primary headache that mostly affects men, although a progressive decrease in the male-to-female ratio has occurred over time. Available, but partly discordant, data on gender-related differences in CH suggest a more marked overlapping with migraine features in female subjects. The aim of this study is to carefully evaluate the female/male distribution of the typical migraine-associated symptoms and of other features of the disease in a large and well-characterized clinical population of CH subjects. Materials and Methods: We enrolled consecutive CH patients regularly followed at the tertiary Headache Science Center of the IRCCS Mondino Foundation of Pavia (Italy) who attended the Center for a CH bout between September 2016 and October 2018. The subjects were requested to fill in a semi-structured questionnaire focused on the presence of migraine-associated symptoms, familiarity for migraine and, for women, the relationship of CH onset with the reproductive events of their life. These data were compared and integrated with those recorded over time in our clinical database, including demographics and clinical characteristics. The primary outcome was the gender distribution of subjects who satisfied ICHD-III criterion D for migraine-associated symptoms. The secondary outcomes were represented by the gender distribution of individual migraine-associated symptoms and of other disease features included in the questionnaire and/or in the clinical database. Results: Data from 163 males (mean age 41.46 ± 10.37) and 87 females suffering of CH (mean age 42.24 ± 11.95) were analyzed. We did not find a different distribution between sexes as regards the primary outcome measure (F 73.6%, M 65.6%, p = 0.200). However, when we analyzed the occurrence of individual symptoms, nausea and osmophobia were reported more frequently by women (p = 0.048, p = 0.037, respectively). Ptosis and nasal congestion were predominant in females (p = 0.017 and p = 0.01, respectively), while enlarged temporal artery was more frequently reported by men (p = 0.001). Distribution of pain across the head tended to be larger in women, extending more frequently to the zygomatic (p = 0.050), parietal (p = 0.049), and frontal (p = 0.037) regions. Women had a longer mean attack duration (p = 0.004) than men. In CH women the onset of disease often corresponded with moments of important changes in the levels of sexual hormones (menarche, post-partum, menopause). Concomitant thyroid diseases and psychiatric disorders were observed more frequently in women than in men, while snoring and smoking habit was reported by a higher percentage of men than women. Conclusion: We confirmed the presence of distinct gender-related differences in CH and added some novel information that lends credibility to the hypothesis of a closer phenotypical similarity between CH and migraine in the female sex. These observations are relevant for advancing our knowledge on CH pathophysiology, as well as for a more refined diagnostic framing and improved management of the disease.",Roberto De Icco;Grazia Sances;Lara Ahmad;Alessia Putortì;Ennio Pucci;Rosaria Greco;Cristina Tassorelli
610,Mengmeng Li,"Here, we describe the first case of familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) resulting from a T666M mutation in the CACNA1A gene of a Chinese individual. A 54-year-old female patient demonstrated extensive clinical manifestations, including transient paropsia, hemianesthesia, logaphasia, hemiplegia, migraine, fever, impaired consciousness, and progressive cerebellar ataxia. At admission, neurological examination showed a fever of 38.6°C, coma, bilateral pupillary constriction, left-sided deviation of both eyes, meningeal irritation, and bilateral positive Chaddock's sign. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed only cerebellar atrophy. The pressure and white blood cells of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were elevated. Her nine relatives also had similar clinical spectra. To further clarify the diagnosis, we conducted a genetic analysis on the family. The results of genetic testing showed that all seven living affected members carried the T666M mutation in the CACNA1A gene. This case report indicates that the diagnosis of FHM should be taken into account when a patient manifests migraine accompanied with hemiplegia, acute encephalopathy, and abnormal CSF. In addition, genetic testing is indispensable for the identification of some atypical attacks of hemiplegic migraine.",Xiangyu Zheng;Rui Zhong;Qian Zhao;Yingxue Lu;Zan Wang;Weihong Lin
611,Wei-Chieh Weng,"Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is regarded as a transition phase between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identification of novel and non-invasive biomarkers that can distinguish AD at an early stage from MCI is warranted for therapeutic and support planning. The goal of this study was to identify the differences of serum metabolomic profiles between MCI and early-stage AD, which could be potential non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD. Methods: The subjects enrolled in the study were classified into two diagnostic groups: MCI (n = 40) and early-stage AD (n = 40). Targeted metabolomics analysis of serum samples was performed using the Biocrates Absolute-IDQ P180 kit. Targeted metabolic data were analyzed by TargetLynx, and MetIDQ software was applied to integrate the metabolites by automated calculation of metabolite concentrations. Results: The datasets of targeted metabolite analysis were analyzed by the orthogonal-projection-to-latent-structure-discriminant-analysis (OPLS-DA) model. The OPLS-DA score plots demonstrated considerable separation between the MCI and early-stage AD patients. The levels of pimelylcarnitine, putrescine, SM (OH) C24:1, and SM C24:0 were significantly lower, whereas the levels of acetylornithine, methionine sulfoxide, and PC ae C44:3 were significantly higher in early-stage AD patients as compared with MCI patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of a combination of three lipid metabolites [SM (OH) C24:1, SM C24:0, and PC ae C44:3] showed an acceptable discrimination between the early-stage AD and MCI patients (area under the curve = 0.788). Conclusions: Our results characterized the differences of serum metabolic profiles between MCI and early-stage AD patients. The positive findings from this study indicate that the minimally invasive method of blood sampling may help to identify patients with AD at an early stage from those with MCI.",Wen-Yi Huang;Hsiang-Yu Tang;Mei-Ling Cheng;Kuan-Hsing Chen
612,Chao-Sheng Chang,"Mirror therapy (MT) facilitates motor learning and induces cortical reorganization and motor recovery from stroke. We applied the new digital mirror therapy (DMT) system to compare the cortical activation under the three visual feedback conditions: (1) no mirror visual feedback (NoMVF), (2) bilateral synchronized task-based mirror visual feedback training (BMVF), and (3) reciprocal task-based mirror visual feedback training (RMVF). During DMT, EEG recordings, including time-dependent event-related desynchronization (ERD) signal amplitude in both mu and beta bands, were obtained from the standard C3 (ispilesional hemisphere, IH), C4 (contralesional hemisphere, CH), and Cz scalp sites (supplementary motor area, SMA). The entire ERD curve was separated into three time-phases: P0 (-2 to 0 s), P1 (0 to 2 s), and P2 (2 to 4 s). Four-way and subsequent repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to examine the effects of group (stroke vs. control group), test condition (NoMVF, BMVF, and RMVF), time-phase (P0, P1, and P2), and brain area (IH, CH, SMA) on the ERD areas (%) in mu and beta bands. For the mu band, generally, ERD areas (%) were larger in the control than in the stroke group. The ERD areas (%) were largest under the RMVF condition, followed by BMVF and NoMVF conditions. Similar results were found in the beta bands. The main effects of group, time-phase, and test condition on the ERD areas (%) were significant for the three brain areas, except the main effect of group in the SMA (Cz) and CH (C4) brain area. The ERD areas (%) were larger in the control than in the stroke group. The ERD area (%) was significantly larger during P1 than during P0 and P2 (ps < 0.02), and during P2 than during P0 (ps < 0.01). The ERD area (%) under the RMVF condition was significantly larger than that under the BMVF condition and NoMVF condition (ps < 0.05). The present study suggests that cortical activation particularly in the SMA (Cz) of the brain increases in the RMVF condition in both healthy subjects and stroke patients. This result supports the hypothesis that stroke patients may benefit from RMVF training.",Ying-Ying Lo;Chien-Liang Chen;Hsin-Min Lee;Wei-Chi Chiang;Ping-Chia Li
613,Kaimin Wu,"Objective: To investigate prospective associations between triglyceride (TG) level and prognosis of first-attacked patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Methods: This retrospective study included 196 patients newly diagnosed with NMOSD from June 2014 to December 2018. Data of clinical parameters, including age of onset, sex, BMI, blood lipid levels, anti-aquaporin-4 status, serum glucose level, therapy regimens, comorbidities, initial Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), relapses, and outcomes were collected. We used logistic regression models to examine the associations among relevant clinical factors and outcomes, and statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 23.0 software. Results: Compared with the high TG group, residual EDSS was relatively lower in the normal TG group (median 1.0 vs. 2.0, P = 0.002). In the univariate analysis, TG level was positively correlated with outcomes (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.18-2.60, P = 0.005) and relapses (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.07-2.31, P = 0.02). Our stratified analysis suggested that patients with normal BMI (OR 4.90, 95% CI 2.10-11.44, P = 0.001) were closely correlated with poor recovery owing to increased TG level. In the multivariate analysis, a statistically significant association still existed between TG level and outcomes (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.02-11.64; P = 0.040) after adjusting for various variables. Conclusions: In first-attacked NMOSD patients, TG level was positively associated with poor recovery. Early monitoring and treatment of elevated TG level in NMOSD patients are important.",LuLu Wen;Ranran Duan;Yanfei Li;Yaobing Yao;Lijun Jing;Yanjie Jia;Junfang Teng;Qianyi He
614,Si Chen,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The G2385R variant of LRRK2 is a risk factor for PD in Han Chinese individuals. We retrospectively compared the clinical outcomes of STN-DBS surgery between PD Han Chinese G2385R variant carriers and non-carriers. Fifty-seven PD patients with bilateral STN-DBS were enrolled, including 8 G2385R+ variant carriers (G2385R+ group) and 49 non-carriers (G2385R- group). Clinical data included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) parts I to IV, levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), Mini-Mental State Examination Scale (MMSE) score, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score measured prior to DBS and 12 months post-DBS. DBS settings were also recorded. All PD patients benefited from STN-DBS surgery. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of motor function, daily living activities, and LEDD reductions at 12 months post-DBS. The rigidity of the post-surgical G2385R+ group was significantly improved compared with that of the G2385R- group (P = 0.045). Post-surgical voltage in the G2385R+ group was significantly higher than that in the G2385R- group (P = 0.033).

615,Joshua L Milstein,"Objective: To test the hypothesis that Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients have increased peripheral inflammation compared to healthy donors and that this systemic activation of the immune system, reflected by acute phase reactants (APRs) measured in the blood, contributes to intrathecal inflammation, which in turn contributes to the development of disability in MS. Methods: Eight serum APRs measured in a prospectively-collected cross-sectional cohort with a total of 51 healthy donors and 291 untreated MS patients were standardized and assembled into related biomarker clusters to derive global measures of systemic inflammation. The resulting APR clusters were compared between diagnostic categories and correlated to equivalently-derived cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of innate and adaptive immunity. Finally, correlations were calculated between biomarkers of systemic and intrathecal inflammation and MS severity measures, which predict future rates of disability progression. Results: While two blood APR clusters were elevated in MS patients, only one exhibited a weak correlation with MS severity. All CSF inflammation clusters, except CSF albumin, correlated with at least one measure of MS severity, with biomarkers of humoral adaptive immunity exhibiting the strongest correlations, especially in Progressive MS. Conclusion: Systemic inflammation does not appear to be strongly associated with intrathecal inflammation in MS. Positive correlations between markers of intrathecal inflammation, especially of humoral immunity, with MS severity measures support a pathogenic role of intrathecal (compartmentalized) inflammation in central nervous system tissue destruction, including in Progressive MS.",Christopher R Barbour;Kayla Jackson;Peter Kosa;Bibiana Bielekova
616,Shinji Itamura,"Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome (HHES) is a subset of acute encephalopathy characterized by infantile-onset with acute hemiconvulsive febrile status and subsequent unilateral cerebral atrophy and hemiparesis. In the chronic phase, patients with HHES develop epilepsy, typically displayed as intractable focal seizures. The patients are often intractable with antiepileptic drugs and need surgical treatment. Although viral encephalitis and genetic abnormalities are presumed to be the underlying etiology, the pathogenesis remains mostly unknown. We describe three cases of successful functional hemispherotomy for intractable epilepsy in HHES. Patients developed acute asymmetrical convulsive status following viral infections during the ages of 17-30 months. Their seizures were intractable with antiepileptic drugs and required hemispherotomy. On the basis of the pathological findings, all cases were diagnosed as focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIId.

617,Martina L Hernandez,"The repercussions of traumatic brain injury (TBI) endure years following the initial insult and involve chronic impairments/disabilities. Studies indicate that these morbidities stem from diffuse pathologies, however, knowledge regarding TBI-mediated diffuse pathologies, and in particular, diffuse neuronal membrane disruption, is limited. Membrane disruption has been shown to occur acutely following injury, primarily within neurons, however, the progression of TBI-induced membrane disruption remains undefined. Therefore, the current study investigated this pathology over a longer temporal profile from 6 h to 4 w following diffuse TBI induced using the central fluid percussion injury (CFPI) model in rats. To visualize membrane disruption, animals received an intracerebroventricular infusion of tagged cell-impermeable dextran 2 h prior to experimental endpoints at 6 h, 1 d, 3 d, 1 w, 2 w, or 4 w post-CFPI. The percentage of total neurons demonstrating dextran uptake, indicative of membrane disruption, was quantified within the lateral neocortex layers V and VI from 6 h to 4 w post-injury. We found that membrane disruption displayed a biphasic pattern, where nearly half of the neurons were membrane disrupted sub-acutely, from 6 h to 3 d post-TBI. At 1 w the membrane disrupted population was dramatically reduced to levels indistinguishable from sham controls. However, by 2 and 4 w following CFPI, approximately half of the neurons analyzed displayed membrane disruption. Moreover, our data revealed that a subset of these late membrane disrupted neurons were NeuN negative (NeuN-). Correlative western blot analyses, however, revealed no difference in NeuN protein expression in the lateral neocortex at any time following injury. Furthermore, the NeuN- membrane disrupted neurons did not co-label with traditional markers of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, or NG2 cells. Immunohistochemistry against NeuN, paired with a hematoxylin and eosin counter-stain, was performed to quantify the possibility of overall NeuN+ neuronal loss following CFPI. A NeuN- population was observed consistently in both sham and injured animals regardless of time post-injury. These data suggest that there is a consistent subpopulation of NeuN- neurons within the lateral neocortex regardless of injury and that these NeuN- neurons are potentially more vulnerable to late membrane disruption. Better understanding of membrane disruption could provide insight into the mechanisms of diffuse pathology and lead to the discovery of novel treatments for TBI.",Todd Chatlos;Karen M Gorse;Audrey D Lafrenaye
618,Ludwig Schlemm,"Background: The ""smoking paradox"" indicates that patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who smoke at the time of their stroke may have a better prognosis after intravenous thrombolysis than non-smokers. However, findings are inconsistent and data analyzing the effect of smoking on treatment efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis are scarce. Methods: We performed a pre-specified post-hoc subgroup analysis of the Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke (WAKE-UP) trial that randomized AIS patients with unknown time of symptom onset who had diffusion-weighted imaging-fluid attenuation inversion recovery (DWI-FLAIR) mismatch to either alteplase or placebo. Patients were categorized as current smokers or non-smokers (including former smokers and never-smokers). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as clinical and imaging follow-up data were analyzed according to smoking status. Results: Four hundred and eighty six patients were included in the analysis. Current smokers (133, 27.4%) were younger (60.1 ± 13.0 vs. 67.2 ± 10.3 years; p < 0.001) and less often had arterial hypertension (45.0% vs. 56.8%; p = 0.02) or atrial fibrillation (3.8% vs. 15.3%; p < 0.001). The acute stroke presentation was more often due to large vessel occlusion among current smokers (27.1 vs. 16.2%; p = 0.01), and smokers had a trend towards more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score>10 in 27.1% vs. 19.5%; p = 0.08). The treatment effect of alteplase, quantified as odds ratio for a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score at 90 days of 0 or 1), did not differ between current smokers and non-smokers (p-value for interaction: 0.59). After adjustment for age and stroke severity, neither the proportion of patients with favorable outcome, nor the median mRS score at 90 days differed between current smokers and non-smokers. When additional potential confounders were included in the model, the median mRS score was higher in current smokers than in non-smokers (cOR of better outcome for current smokers vs. non-smokers: 0.664 [0.451-0.978], p = 0.04). Conclusions: In patients with mild to moderate MRI-proven AIS and unknown time of symptom onset with DWI-FLAIR mismatch, current smokers had worse functional outcome as compared to non-smokers. Current smoking did not modify the treatment effect of alteplase. Clinical Trial registration: Main trial (WAKE-UP): ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01525290; and EudraCT, 2011-005906-32.

619,Takayuki Okano,"In the mammalian cochlea, resident macrophages settle in the spiral ligament, spiral ganglion, and stria vascularis, even at the steady state. Resident macrophages in the cochlea are believed to maintain homeostasis in the inner ear and become active, as part of the front line defense, following inner ear damage. However, the exact roles of cochlear resident macrophages require further clarification. Colony stimulating factor-1 (Csf1) signaling regulates survival, proliferation, and differentiation of resident macrophages and appears to be essential for resident macrophages in the inner ear. To examine the roles of Csf1 signaling in auditory function, we examined the ossicles and inner ear of homozygous Csf1 mutant (Csf1  ) mice. The ossicles including the incus and stapes of Csf1  mice macroscopically demonstrated bone thickening, and the otic capsules of the inner ear were also thick and opaque. Histological analyses demonstrated that the otic capsules in Csf1  mice were thickened and showed spongy bone degeneration. Measurements of the auditory brainstem response revealed significant elevation of thresholds in 4-week old Csf1  mice compared with wild-type littermates, indicating that Csf1  mice demonstrate hearing loss due to, at least in part, deformity of the ossicles and bone capsule of the inner ear. Furthermore, Csf1  mice are deficient in the number of resident macrophages in the spiral ligament and stria vascularis, but not in the spiral ganglion. These data provide evidence that Csf1 signaling is important not only for bone formation in the inner ear, but also for the maintenance of resident macrophages in the spiral ligament and stria vascularis in the adult mouse cochlea.",Ippei Kishimoto

621,B William Downs,"In the face of the current Opioid crisis in America killing close to 800,000 people since 2004, we are proposing a novel approach to assist in at least attenuating these unwanted premature deaths. While we applaud the wonderful efforts of our governmental institutes and professional societies (NIDA, NIAAA, ASAM, ABAM ) in their extraordinary efforts in combating this continued dilemma, the current approach is failing, and other alternative approaches should at least be tested. These truths present a serious ethical dilemma to scientists, clinicians and counselors in the Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) treatment community. It is important to realize that the current DSM-5 does not actually accurately display the natural brain reward process. The human brain has not been designed to carve out specific drugs like opioids, alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, benzodiazepines or cannabis and process addictions such as gambling as distinct endophenotypes. This is true in spite of natural ligands for cannabinoids, endorphins, or even benzodiazepines. The most accurate endophenotype is indeed reward dysfunction (e.g hypodopaminergic or hyperdopaminergic). With this mind, we are hereby proposing that the current Medication Assisted Treatment (i.e. 'MAT') expands to needed individuals as an initial ""Band-Aid"" to reduce harm avoidance, with the long-term goal of prophylaxis. So, to be clear, there may be other promising modalities other than MAT such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), exercise and even new medications with positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors, as well as the highly researched Genetic Addiction Risk Score (GARS) coupled with precision KB220Z. This will induce ""dopamine homeostasis"" to effectively rebalance and restore healthier brain function by promoting the cross talk between various brain regions (e.g. Nucleus accumbens, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus etc.) resulting in dopamine homeostasis.

Thus, their surgical removal is challenging, recurrence rates are high, and their therapeutic strategies remain controversial. In this video, we present a 47-year-old man with a recent onset of swallowing difficulties, hoarseness, and weight loss for several weeks. In the neurological examination, he had complete paralysis of the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th cranial nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a heterogeneously enhancing expansile invasive mass lesion centered within the clivus and involving the C1, the occipitocervical junction, the retropharynx, and the hypoglossal canal. The decision was made to proceed with multiple staged surgeries. In the first surgical stage, we performed a mastoidectomy with the infralabyrinthine approach to perform a test clip ligation of the sigmoid sinus and to resect the tumor component that extended into the infralabyrinthine space. In the second stage, we performed a far-lateral transcondylar approach for tumor resection and occipitocervical fusion. In the third stage, we used a transoral approach with endoscopic assistance to complete the excision of the remaining tumor in the retropharyngeal space and anterior aspect of C1 and C2 bodies that were not accessible in the first two stages. The surgeries and postoperative course were uneventful. Postoperative MRI showed a gross total resection of the tumor. Histopathology indicated a chordoma. The patient subsequently received proton radiotherapy and has continued to do well without recurrence at 14 months' follow-up.

624,Jiang Zhu,"There is a growing recognition regarding the importance of pial collateral flow in the protection from impending ischemic stroke both in preclinical and clinical studies. Collateral flow is also a major player in sensory stimulation-based protection from impending ischemic stroke. Doppler optical coherence tomography has been employed to image spatiotemporal patterns of collateral flow within the dorsal branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) as it provides a powerful tool for quantitative in vivo flow parameters imaging (velocity, flux, direction of flow, and radius of imaged branches). It was employed prior to and following dorsal permanent MCA occlusion (pMCAo) in rat models of treatment by protective sensory stimulation, untreated controls, or sham surgery controls. Unexpectedly, following pMCAo in the majority of subjects, some MCA branches continued to show anterograde blood flow patterns over time despite severing of the MCA. Further, in the presence of protective sensory stimulation, the anterograde velocity and flux were stronger and lasted longer than in retrograde flow branches, even within different branches of single subjects, but stimulated retrograde branches showed stronger flow parameters at 24 h. Our study suggests that the spatiotemporal patterns of collateral-based dorsal MCA flow are dynamic and provide a detailed description on the differential effects of protective sensory stimulation.",Aneeka M Hancock;Li Qi;Klaus Telkmann;Babak Shahbaba;Zhongping Chen;Ron D Frostig
625,Anusha Dravid,"A spinal cord injury can damage neuronal connections required for both motor and sensory function. Barriers to regeneration within the central nervous system, including an absence of neurotrophic stimulation, impairs the ability of injured neurons to re-establish their original circuitry. Exogenous neurotrophin administration has been shown to promote axonal regeneration and outgrowth following injury. The neurotrophins possess chemotrophic properties that guide axons towards the region of highest concentration. These growth factors have demonstrated potential to be used as a therapeutic intervention for orienting axonal growth beyond the injury lesion, towards denervated targets. However, the success of this approach is dependent on the appropriate spatiotemporal distribution of these molecules to ensure detection and navigation by the axonal growth cone. A number of in vitro gradient-based assays have been employed to investigate axonal response to neurotrophic gradients. Such platforms have helped elucidate the potential of applying a concentration gradient of neurotrophins to promote directed axonal regeneration towards a functionally significant target. Here, we review these techniques and the principles of gradient detection in axonal guidance, with particular focus on the use of neurotrophins to orient the trajectory of regenerating axons.",Sam Parittotokkaporn;Zaid Aqrawe;Simon J O'Carroll;Darren Svirskis

627,Ziad M Hafed,"Rigorous behavioral studies made in human subjects have shown that small-eccentricity target displacements are associated with increased saccadic reaction times, but the reasons for this remain unclear. Before characterizing the neurophysiological foundations underlying this relationship between the spatial and temporal aspects of saccades, we tested the triggering of small saccades in the male rhesus macaque monkey. We also compared our results to those obtained in human subjects, both from the existing literature and through our own additional measurements. Using a variety of behavioral tasks exercising visual and non-visual guidance of small saccades, we found that small saccades consistently require more time than larger saccades to be triggered in the non-human primate, even in the absence of any visual guidance and when valid advance information about the saccade landing position is available. We also found a strong asymmetry in the reaction times of small upper versus lower visual field visually-guided saccades, a phenomenon that has not been described before for small saccades, even in humans. Following the suggestion that an eye movement is not initiated as long as the visuo-oculomotor system is within a state of balance, in which opposing commands counterbalance each other, we propose that the longer reaction times are a signature of enhanced times needed to create the symmetry-breaking condition that puts downstream premotor neurons into a push-pull regime necessary for rotating the eyeballs. Our results provide an important catalog of non-human primate oculomotor capabilities on the miniature scale, allowing concrete predictions on underlying neurophysiological mechanisms.",Laurent Goffart
628,Louis N Vinke,"Our visual system is tasked with transforming variations in light within our environment into a coherent percept, typically described using properties such as luminance and contrast. Models of vision often downplay the importance of luminance in shaping cortical responses, instead prioritizing representations that do not co-vary with overall luminance (i.e., contrast), and yet visuocortical response properties that may reflect luminance encoding remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined whether well-established visuocortical response properties may also reflect luminance encoding, challenging the idea that luminance information itself plays no significant role in supporting visual perception. To do so, we measured functional activity in human visual cortex when presenting stimuli varying in contrast and mean luminance, and found that luminance response functions are strongly contrast dependent between 50 to 250 cd/m2, confirmed with a subsequent experiment. High contrast stimuli produced linearly increasing responses as luminance increased logarithmically for all early visual areas, whereas low contrast stimuli produced either flat (V1) or positive linear (V2 & V3) response profiles. These results reveal that the mean luminance information of a visual signal persists within visuocortical representations, potentially reflecting an inherent imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory components that can be either contrast-dependent (V1 & V2) or contrast-invariant (V3). The role of luminance should be considered when aiming to drive potent visually-evoked responses, and when comparing activity across studies. More broadly, overall luminance should be weighed heavily as a core feature of the visual system, and play a significant role in cortical models of vision.",Sam Ling
629,Kohitij Kar,"Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is used as a non-invasive tool for cognitive enhancement and clinical applications. The physiological effects of tACS, however, are complex and poorly understood (Liu et al. 2018). Most studies of tACS focus on its ability to entrain brain oscillations (Herrmann et al. 2013), but our behavioral results in humans (Kar and Krekelberg 2014) and extracellular recordings in nonhuman primates (Kar et al. 2017) support the view that tACS at 10 Hz also affects brain function by reducing sensory adaptation. Our primary goal here is to test this hypothesis using BOLD imaging in human subjects. Using concurrent fMRI and tACS, and a motion adaptation paradigm developed to quantify BOLD adaptation (Huk et al. 2001), we show that tACS significantly attenuates adaptation in the human motion area (hMT+). In addition, an exploratory analysis shows that tACS increases functional connectivity of the stimulated hMT+ with the rest of the brain and the dorsal attention network in particular. Based on field estimates from individualized head models, we relate these changes to the strength of tACS-induced electric fields. Specifically, we report that functional connectivity (between hMT+ and any other region of interest) increases in proportion to the field strength in the region of interest. These findings add support for the claim that weak 10 Hz currents applied to the scalp modulate both local and global measures of brain activity.",Takuya Ito;Michael W Cole;Bart Krekelberg
630,Shimpei Yamagishi,"Recent studies using video-based eye tracking have presented accumulating evidence that post-saccadic oscillation defined in reference to the pupil center (PSOp) is larger than that to the iris center (PSOi). This indicates that the relative motion of the pupil reflects the viscoelasticity of the tissue of the iris. It is known that the pupil size controlled by the sphincter/dilator pupillae muscles reflects many aspects of cognition. A hypothesis derived from this fact is that cognitive tasks affect the properties of PSOp due to the change in the state of these muscles. To test this hypothesis, we conducted pro- and anti-saccade tasks for human participants and adopted the recent physical model of PSO to evaluate the dynamic properties of PSOp/PSOi. The results showed the dependence of the elasticity coefficient of the PSOp on the anti-saccade task, but this effect was not significant for the PSOi. This suggests that cognitive tasks such as anti-saccade tasks affect elasticity of the muscle of the iris. We found that the trial-by-trial fluctuation in the pre-saccade absolute pupil size correlated with the elasticity coefficient of PSOp. We also found the task dependence of the viscosity coefficient and overshoot amount of PSOi, which probably reflects the dynamics of the entire eyeball movement. The difference in task dependence between PSOp and PSOi indicates that the separate measures of these two can be means to distinguish factors related to the oculomotor neural system from those related to the physiological states of the iris tissue.",Makoto Yoneya;Shigeto Furukawa
631,Solenn Gousset,"The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of burst-like conditioning electrical stimulation versus continuous stimulation of cutaneous nociceptors for inducing increased pinprick sensitivity in the surrounding unstimulated skin (a phenomenon referred to as secondary hyperalgesia). In a first experiment (N=30) we compared the increase in mechanical pinprick sensitivity induced by 50 Hz burst-like stimulation (N=15) versus 5 Hz continuous stimulation (N=15), while maintaining constant the total number of stimuli and the total duration of stimulation. We found a significantly greater increase in mechanical pinprick sensitivity in the surrounding unstimulated skin after 50 Hz burst-like stimulation compared to 5 Hz continuous stimulation (p=.013, Cohen's d=.970). Importantly, to control for the different frequency of stimulation we compared in a second experiment (N=40) 5 Hz continuous stimulation (N=20) versus 5 Hz burst-like stimulation (N=20), this time while keeping the total number of stimuli as well as the frequency of stimulation identical. Again we found a significantly greater increase in pinprick sensitivity after 5 Hz burst-like stimulation compared to 5 Hz continuous stimulation (p=.009, Cohen's d=.868). To conclude, our data shows indicate that burst-like conditioning electrical stimulation is more efficacious than continuous stimulation for inducing secondary hyperalgesia.",André Mouraux;Emanuel Nathanael Van Den Broeke
632,Elodie Hinnekens,"Motor behaviors are often hypothesized to be set up from the combination of a small number of modules encoded in the central nervous system. These modules are thought to combine such that a variety of motor tasks can be realized, from reproducible tasks like walking to more unusual locomotor tasks that typically exhibit more step-by-step variability. Here we investigated the impact of step-by-step variability on the modular architecture of unusual tasks compared to walking. To this aim, twenty adults had to perform walking and two unusual modes of locomotion inspired by developmental milestones (cruising and crawling). Sixteen surface electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded to extract both spatial and temporal modules. Modules were extracted from both averaged and non-averaged (i.e. single-step) EMG signals to assess the significance of step-to-step variability when practicing such unusual locomotor tasks. The number of modules extracted from averaged data was similar across tasks, but a higher number of modules was required to reconstruct non-averaged EMG data of the unusual tasks. While certain walking modules were shared with cruising and crawling, task-specific modules were necessary to account for the muscle patterns underlying these unusual locomotion modes. These results highlight a more complex modularity (e.g. more modules) for cruising and crawling compared to walking, which was only apparent when the step-to-step variability of EMG patterns was considered. This suggests that considering non-averaged data is relevant when studying muscle modularity especially in motor tasks with high variability like in motor development.",Bastien Berret;Manh-Cuong Do;Caroline Teulier
633,Susan C Campbell,"Unprovoked recurrent seizures are a serious comorbidity affecting most patients who suffer from glioma, a primary brain tumor composed of malignant glial cells. Cellular mechanisms contributing to the development of recurrent spontaneous seizures include the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from glioma into extracellular space. Under physiological conditions, astrocytes express two high affinity glutamate transporters, Glt-1 and Glast, which are responsible for the removal of excess extracellular glutamate. In the context of neurological disease or brain injury, astrocytes become reactive which can negatively affect neuronal function, causing hyperexcitability and/or death. Using electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and Western blot analysis in different orthotopic xenograft and allograft models of human and mouse gliomas, we find that peritumoral astrocytes exhibit astrocyte scar formation characterized by proliferation, cellular hypertrophy, process elongation, and increased GFAP and pSTAT3. Overall, peritumoral reactive astrocytes show a significant reduction in glutamate and potassium uptake, as well as decreased glutamine synthetase activity. A subset of peritumoral astrocytes displayed a depolarized resting membrane potential, further contributing to reduced potassium and glutamate homeostasis. These changes may contribute to the propagation of peritumoral neuronal hyperexcitability and excitotoxic death.",Carmen Muñoz-Ballester;Lata Chaunsali;William A Mills;Jennifer H Yang;Harald Sontheimer;Stefanie Robel

Bilateral vestibulopathy is a clinical syndrome in which laboratory testing plays a crucial diagnostic role. We aimed to establish the frequency of detection of that finding in a tertiary level hospital considering the new methods of laboratory vestibular examination nowadays in use, with respect to the conventional caloric and rotatory chair test approaches.


DESIGN
Two similar time periods (5 years) were retrospectively evaluated, and the demographic, clinical data and test results from 4,576 patients were reviewed. In the first period, the diagnosis was based on caloric and rotatory chair tests and, in the second, on the video head impulse test.


RESULTS
Of the patients included, 3.77% in the first period and 4.58% in the second met the criteria for bilateral vestibular hypofunction; there was no significant difference between both periods.


CONCLUSIONS
The functional vestibular evaluation to detect bilateral deficiency makes no significant difference to the number of patients diagnosed with a bilateral vestibulopathy. New diagnostic categories probably depend not only on the availability and accessibility of complete vestibular and visual-vestibular evaluation, but also on recent advances in defining vestibular disorders. Bilateral vestibular hypofunction manifests with very different patterns. Progress in more detailed definition (clinical and laboratory) is needed, in particular when all 6 semicircular canals and both maculae are available for testing.",Laura Alvarez-Gomez;Raquel Manrique-Huarte

This study aims to further assess the rates and risk factors for relapse in medication overuse headache (MOH) patients in China.


METHODS
The patients were admitted to neurology outpatient clinics at Chinese PLA General Hospital (primarily for headache) and diagnosed with MOH. They responded well to 2 months of preventive treatment and completed a 1-year consultation. General information was collected, including demographic characteristics (age, height, weight, and education level), the clinical features of the headache and the use of pain relievers (type, frequency and duration). Differences in each factor between the group with relapse and the group without relapse were analyzed by the chi-square test or Wilcoxon test. Variables with a p < 0.05 were included as independent variables in nonconditional logistic regression analysis.


RESULTS
In total, 129 patients were recruited for this retrospective study. The relapse rate of the MOH patients at the 1-year follow-up was 24.8%. The relapse rate was significantly higher in the patients with migraine (29/97, 29.9%) than in the patients with tension-type headache (3/32, 9.4%) and in the patients with low education levels (middle school or lower; 24/77, 31.6%) than in those with high education levels (high school or higher; 8/52, 15.4%). Nonconditional logistic regression analysis showed that the type of primary headache was an independent risk factor for MOH relapse (OR 3.719, p = 0.044).

Hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) are independent risk factors of stroke and are associated with each other. Although evidence suggests that they are related to cognitive impairment, the relationship between hypertension accompanied with HHcy and poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is unclear.


OBJECTIVE
To define the relationship between hypertension with HHcy and early cognitive impairment after acute cerebral infarction.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our study enrolled 232 patients with acute first-ever ischemic stroke. Patients were assigned to 3 groups by blood pressure and homocysteine (Hcy) levels: hypertension with HHcy, simple hypertension, or control. Cognition was assessed by the Montreal cognitive assessment at admission and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.


RESULTS
The hypertension with HHcy group exhibited the highest incidence of early cognitive impairment (simple hypertension: p = 0.000; control: p = 0.000). This group also had lower visual space/executive scores than the simple hypertension group (p = 0.000) and lower delayed recall scores than the control group (p = 0.011). Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension with HHcy (OR 7.797; 95% CI 2.917-20.843; p = 0.000), the level of serum Hcy (OR 1.063; 95% CI 1.109-1.109; p = 0.005), education years (OR 0.797; 95% CI 0.722-0.880; p = 0.000), and Fazekas scale of leukoaraiosis (OR 1.648; 95% CI 1.239-2.191; p = 0.001) were independent influencing factors of early PSCI; however, simple hypertension (OR 1.183, 95% CI 0.208-6.737; p = 0.850) and simple HHcy (OR 1.112, 95% CI 0.181-6.810; p = 0.909) were not.

Falls are common among persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). On the other hand, predicting falls is complex as there are both generic and PD-specific contributors. In particular, the role of non-motor symptoms has been less studied.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to identify the role of non-motor predictors of falling in persons with PD (PwP).


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was carried out in PwP recruited from a movement disorders clinic. Clinical and demographical data were collected. All PwP were assessed using the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Variables were assessed at the bivariate level. Significant variables were put into a logistic regression model.


RESULTS
A total of 179 PwP were included. Overall, 16.8% of PwP had fallen in the past 12 months, with 53.3% of them being recurrent fallers. The mean number of monthly falls was 2.5 ± 3.3. Factors associated with falling in the bivariate analysis included the disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr stage, MDS-UPDRS part I and II, postural instability/gait disturbance (PIGD) subtype, NMSS urinary domain, NMSS miscellaneous domain, and non-motor severity burden (all p-values < 0.05). After multivariate analysis, only the disease duration (p = 0.03) and PIGD (p = 0.03) remained as independent risk factors.


CONCLUSION

Although it is known that anxiety and depressive disorders frequently accompany migraine and TTH, the role of somatic amplification (SSA) and health anxiety in these diseases is not adequately known.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study is to compare SSA and health anxiety in patients with migraine or TTH, and healthy controls and to investigate the relationships between SSA, health anxiety, headache characteristics, anxiety and depressive symptoms.


METHODS
Fifty-four migraine, 50 TTH patients from the outpatient unit of the neurology department and 53 healthy volunteers were recruited for the study. The somatosensory amplification scale (SSAS), health anxiety inventory, Beck depression (BDI) and anxiety inventory (BAI) were administered to all participants.


RESULTS
The SSAS scores were significantly higher in migraineurs compared with the healthy controls. The health anxiety scores were significantly higher in both migraine and TTH groups. The BDI and BAI scores were also significantly higher in migraine and TTH groups compared with the controls. A significant positive correlation was found between headache frequency and BAI scores, the visual analogue scale scores and SSAS and BDI scores in migraineurs. The SSAS scores were also significantly correlated with the BDI and BAI scores in both of the headache groups. A similar correlation was determined with the health anxiety scores.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been described as a good tool to detect cognitive impairment. The ideal MoCA cutoff score is still under debate. The aim was to provide MoCA norms and accuracy data for seniors with a lower education level, including illiterates.


METHODS
Data originated from an epidemiological study conducted in the municipality of Tremembe, Brazil. The Brazilian MoCA test was applied as part of the cognitive assessment in all participants. Of the 630 participants, 385 were classified as cognitively normal (CN) and were included in the normative data set, 110 individuals were diagnosed with dementia and 135 were classified as having cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND).


RESULTS
The total scores varied significantly according to age and education among the three diagnostic groups: CN, CIND and dementia (p < 0.001). To distinguish participants with CN from dementia, the best MoCA cutoff was 15 points (sensitivity 90%, specificity 77%) and to differentiate those with CN from CIND, the MoCA cutoff was 19 points (sensitivity 84%, specificity 49%). Those scores varied according to education level.


CONCLUSIONS
The MoCA test did not have a high accuracy for detecting CIND in the population with a low educational level. Nevertheless, this tool may be used to detect dementia, especially in individuals with more than five years of education, if a lower cutoff score is adopted.",Mônica S Yassuda;Fabio H G Porto;Sonia M D Brucki;Ricardo Nitrini

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease without a cure, but multidisciplinary treatment can maintain the quality of life (QOL) of persons with ALS (PALS). Despite health professionals possibly being affected by ALS in their care roles, little is known about the impact of ALS care on these professionals.


OBJECTIVE
To analyze the effects of interactions between PALS and Nursing/Psychology students.


METHODS
Over 12 weeks, 16 student pairs performed weekly 60-minute home visits to 16 PALS. Instruments used for analyses were the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire for the PALS; and the Draw-a-Person test and the Desiderative Questionnaire for the students. All instruments were applied twice: at the beginning (pre-first visit) and at the end of the study (post-12 visits).


RESULTS
After 12 weeks, there was not a significant change in total QOL or its five domains (existential wellbeing, physical wellbeing, psychological wellbeing, physical symptoms, and support). Existential wellbeing/support domains contributed most to the QOL of the PALS (pre-first visit and post-12 visits). Students showed anxiety/impulsivity but preserved adequacy to reality, logical thinking and global perception with regard to the PALS. We found that students were psychologically fragile in some subgroups/moments.


CONCLUSIONS
Students' visits to PALS may contribute to the maintenance of the QOL of the patients. Additionally, visits, with psychological support for the students, seem safe and could contribute to the students' psychological maturation as health professionals. Additional psychological support may be necessary for some students in fragile subgroups/moments.",Leila Salomão Plata Cury Tardivo;Acary Souza Bulle Oliveira;Helga Cristina Almeida da Silva

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease characterized by progressive loss of muscle fiber, gradually from proximal to distal. Although a few studies have investigated hand grip strength in non-ambulatory DMD patients, a lack of literature was found determining its relationship with functional capacity.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to determine the associations between hand grip strength and functional measures in non-ambulatory children with DMD.


METHODS
Hand grip strength was evaluated using a dynamometer in children with DMD. The children with DMD were evaluated with the Turkish version of the Egen Klassifikation Scale Version 2 (EK2) for global functional capacity, the Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) for upper limb functional performance and the ABILHAND-Kids for hand ability.


RESULTS
The mean age of 38 DMD children was 12.02 ± 1.99 years. Dominant hand grip strength of the children with DMD was higher than the non-dominant hand (p < 0.05). The EK2 was 13.02 ± 5.50, PUL was 49.86 ± 14.34 and ABILHAND-Kids was 26.81 ± 7.59. Hand grip strength was found to be correlated with the EK2 (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
It is known that measuring functional ability and strength in very weak children with DMD has been difficult and complex for therapists/clinicians in the clinical environment. Although there is a moderate correlation, hand grip strength may be used in clinical practice as a practical assessment tool to have an immediate insight into the global functional capacity in non-ambulatory DMD children.",Ipek Gürbüz;Öznur Yilmaz;Güllü Aydin;Ayşe Karaduman

Drug-resistant epilepsy associated with central nervous system tumors is generally caused by low grade gliomas. This group of tumors is usually found in brain eloquent areas, such as the insular lobe, rolandic cortex and supplementary motor area and, historically, possess a greater risk of postoperative deficits.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this investigation was to present our surgical experience on patients with drug-resistant epilepsy caused by gliomas in eloquent areas. We retrospectively investigated variables that impact seizure control, such as tumor location, extent of resection, invasion into the lenticulostriate arteries in the patient, especially those with insular gliomas.


METHODS
Out of 67 patients with eloquent area brain tumors operated on in our service between 2007 and 2016, 14 patients had symptoms of drug-resistant epilepsy. Volumetric analysis, extent of resection (EOR), type of approach and mapping, among other factors were correlated with the 12-month postoperative seizure outcome.


RESULTS
Univariate analysis showed that the factors showing statistical relevance with seizure control were preoperative volume (p = 0.005), EOR (p = 0.028) and postoperative volume (p = 0.030).


CONCLUSION
There was a statistically significant association between the EOR and the Engel score for epilepsy control: an EOR < 70 was associated with Engel II, III, IV and an EOR > 90 was associated with Engel I.

Since then, five different autoantibodies (mGluR5, Hu, NMDAR, SOX, PCA2) have been associated with Hodgkin's disease. It is interesting to note the divergent outcomes of Shakespeare's character and the patient in the original description by Carr, the latter recovering to lead a normal life, and the former deceased.

647,Elisabetta C Del Re,"Background. Abnormalities of mismatch negativity (MMN), an event-related potential, indexing preattentive mechanisms, are consistently reported in schizophrenia (SZ). MMN abnormalities elicited to different deviant types have been recently shown to distinguish among patients according to length of their illness as well as inpatient versus outpatient status, and to be modulated by premorbid IQ. The objective of this study was to evaluate the MMN elicited by both frequency and duration deviant stimuli in patients with early schizophrenia (EP) recruited from an outpatient clinic in Boston, Massachusetts. Methods. Twenty-two healthy controls (HC) and 22 age-, handedness-, and gender-matched EP were tested using a frequency and duration MMN paradigm. Clinical data were also collected. Results. Frequency MMN amplitude but not duration MMN was significantly reduced in EP relative to HC subjects (P = .015). Conclusions. These results indicate that in this sample of early psychosis outpatient group, reductions in frequency MMN but not in duration MMN index clinical status. The relationship between age at first hospitalization and MMN frequency and duration amplitude and latency indicates that neurodevelopmental stage, auditory function, and clinical status are tightly linked.",Toshihiko Maekawa;Raquelle I Mesholam-Gately;Joanne Wojcik;Larry J Seidman;Robert W McCarley;Margaret A Niznikiewicz
648,Alfredo Ardila,"Background. Contemporary neuroimaging techniques, particularly fMRI and PET, have demonstrated that cognitive abilities do not strictly depend on specific brain areas, but rather on complex brain circuits or systems.Methods. Using PubMed and Google Scholar databases, a search for functional studies (fMRI and PET) during the performance of several neuropsychological tests was done. The pattern of brain activity found during the solution of some executive functions, language, memory, calculation, and visuospatial/visuoconstructive abilities is reviewed.Results. Brain activity supporting the performance in these tests is usually quite extended, and involves not only those brain areas traditionally assumed in neuropsychology, but also other cortical and sometimes subcortical regions.Conclusions. Most neuropsychological tests are simultaneously evaluating different cognitive abilities associated with the activity of diverse brain areas. ""Cognitive/anatomical"" correlations could only be established for some relatively simple functions. This change in the understanding about the brain organization of cognition has not been reflected in the interpretation of the neuropsychological tests yet. The interpretation of neuropsychological tests should be based not only in clinical observations but also in functional studies. This is a necessary further step in clinical neuropsychology.",Feggy Ostrosky
649,Yana Suchy,"Objective: Executive functioning (EF) is critical for performance of instrumental activities of daily living, including medication management. Under complex conditions, daily activities require greater EF resources. This study examined if older adults who exhibit weaknesses in EF are at an increased risk for mismanaging their medications under complex contexts.Method: Participants were 50 non-Hispanic white community-dwelling older adults, ages 60-85. At a baseline visit, EF was assessed using the Push-Turn-Taptap task, and daily life complexity and medication regimen complexity were assessed using a structured interview. Medication management across the subsequent 8 weeks was assessed by weekly pill counts.Results: A general linear regression using at-home medication management as the dependent variable showed that EF and the interaction between EF and life complexity were significant predictors (both p values < .001). Specifically, life complexity had a deleterious impact on medication management, but only for older adults whose EF performance was in the bottom 22% of the sample. There was no association between medication regimen complexity and accuracy of medication management.Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that older adults who have even mild EF weaknesses are at an increased risk for mismanaging their medication when leading complex daily lives. These findings add support for the Contextually Valid Executive Assessment (ConVExA) model, which asserts that EF interacts with contextual factors as a predictor of functional outcomes.",Rosemary E Ziemnik;Madison A Niermeyer;Stacey L Brothers
650,Joanna Ciafone,"OBJECTIVES
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) have substantial clinical and biological overlap, with cognitive deficits typically observed in the executive and visuospatial domains. However, the neuropsychological profiles of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) associated with these disorders are not well understood.


METHODS
This systematic review examined existing literature on cognition in MCI due to LB disease (MCI-LB) and PD (PD-MCI) using an electronic search of seven databases (Medline, Embase, Psychinfo, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and ScienceDirect). MCI-LB results were reviewed narratively given the small number of resulting papers (n = 7). Outcome variables from PD-MCI studies (n = 13) were extracted for meta-analysis of standardised mean differences (SMD).


RESULTS
In MCI-LB, executive dysfunction and slowed processing speed were the most prominent impairments, while visuospatial and working memory (WM) functions were also poor. MCI-LB scored significantly lower on verbal memory tests relative to controls, but significantly higher than patients with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease. Quantitative analysis of studies in PD-MCI showed a similar profile of impairment, with the largest deficits in visuospatial function (Benton Judgement of Line Orientation, SMD g = -2.09), executive function (Trail Making Test B, SMD g = -1.65), verbal ability (Naming Tests, SMD g = -0.140), and WM (Trail Making Test A, SMD g = -1.20). In both MCI-LB and PD-MCI, verbal and visuospatial memory retrieval was impaired, while encoding and storage appeared relatively intact.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings of this systematic review indicate similar neuropsychological profiles in the MCI stages of DLB and PDD. Executive impairment may at least partially explain poor performance in other domains.",Bethany Little;Alan J Thomas;Peter Gallagher
651,Nasrin Mohammadhasani,"OBJECTIVE
Several studies agree on the link between attention and eye movements during reading. It has been well established that attention and working memory (WM) interact. A question that could be addressed to better understand these relationships is: to what extent can an attention deficit affect eye movements and, consequently, remembering a word? The main aims of the present study were (1) to compare visual patterns of word stimuli between children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and typically developing (TD) children, during a visual task on word stimuli; (2) to examine the WM accuracy of the word stimuli; and (3) to compare the dynamic of visual scan path in both groups.


METHOD
A total of 49 children with ADHD, age and sex matched with 32 TD children, were recruited. We used eye-tracking technology in which the Word Memory Test was implemented. To highlight the scan path of participants, two measures were used: the ordered direction of reading and the entropy index.


RESULTS
ADHD groups showed a poorer WM than TD group. They did not follow a typical scan path across the words compared with TD children, but their visual scanning was discontinuous, uncoordinated, and chaotic. ADHD groups showed an index of entropy among the four categories of saccades higher than TD group.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings were discussed in light of two directions: the relationship between atypical visual scan path and WM and the training implications related to the necessity of redirecting the dynamic of visual scan path in ADHD to improve WM.",Tindara Caprì;Andrea Nucita;Giancarlo Iannizzotto;Rosa Angela Fabio
652,Gowri K Iyer,"OBJECTIVES
While the burden of dementia is increasing in low- and middle-income countries, there is a low rate of diagnosis and paucity of research in these regions. A major challenge to study dementia is the limited availability of standardised diagnostic tools for use in populations with linguistic and educational diversity. The objectives of the study were to develop a standardised and comprehensive neurocognitive test battery to diagnose dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to varied etiologies, across different languages and educational levels in India, to facilitate research efforts in diverse settings.


METHODS
A multidisciplinary expert group formed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) collaborated towards adapting and validating a neurocognitive test battery, that is, the ICMR Neurocognitive Tool Box (ICMR-NCTB) in five Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam), for illiterates and literates, to standardise diagnosis of dementia and MCI in India.


RESULTS
Following a review of existing international and national efforts at standardising dementia diagnosis, the ICMR-NCTB was developed and adapted to the Indian setting of sociolinguistic diversity. The battery consisted of tests of cognition, behaviour, and functional activities. A uniform protocol for diagnosis of normal cognition, MCI, and dementia due to neurodegenerative diseases and stroke was followed in six centres. A systematic plan for validating the ICMR-NCTB and establishing cut-off values in a diverse multicentric cohort was developed.

653,Pablo Medrano-Martinez,"OBJECTIVES
The objective of our study was to assess attention processes and executive function in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (NT1). To do so, we compared the results with those of a control group from the general population using an extensive neuropsychological test battery.


METHODS
We studied 28 patients with NT1 and 28 healthy control participants matched for age, gender, and educational level. They all completed questionnaires on sleepiness, anxiety, and depression symptoms. In addition, they underwent neuropsychological tests. The ability to maintain attention was assessed using three computer tasks with different levels of complexity.


RESULTS
Patients had significantly more daytime sleepiness than controls. A significant negative correlation between depression and disease duration was found in NT1 patients. The results of the anxiety questionnaire correlated with the presence of sleep paralysis. There were significant differences in information processing speed subtasks. Patients made significantly more omissions and generally reacted slower and more variably than controls in computerized tasks. As for executive function, patients performed worse in phonologic fluency tasks than controls. However, when the influence of processing speed on fluency tasks was statistically controlled, part of this significant difference disappeared.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that the negative correlation between depression and disease duration probably reflects progressive adaptation to the functional burden of the disease. Information processing speed plays a fundamental role in the expression of cognitive deficits. We emphasized the need to control the influence of processing speed and sustained attention in the neuropsychological assessment of NT1 patients.",Rosa Peraita-Adrados
654,Rechdi Ahdab,"BACKGROUND
Somatotopy is considered the hallmark of the primary motor cortex. While this is fundamentally true for the major body parts (head, upper and lower extremities), evidence supporting the existence of within-limb somatotopy is scarce.


METHOD
We report a young man presenting recurrent ischemic strokes with selective finger weakness in whom serial motor cortex mapping procedures were performed.


RESULT
Following the first stroke, which largely spared the motor cortex, motor mapping displayed overlap of the motor representations of the hand muscles. The second focal stroke, affecting the lateral part of the hand knob, resulted in selective loss of the first dorsal interosseous muscle motor evoked potentials while sparing those of the adductor digiti minimi muscle. This observation is in apparent contradiction with the first mapping results that suggested complete overlap of motor representations.


DISCUSSION
Our mapping results provide evidence for the existence of very precise within-limb somatotopy and confirm the proposed homuncular order, whereby lateral fingers are represented laterally and medial fingers medially. The discrepancy between the initial and subsequent mapping results is discussed in light of functional organization of the primary motor cortex.",Samar S Ayache;Hassan Hosseini;Anthony G Mansour;Philippe Kerschen;Wassim H Farhat;Moussa A Chalah;Jean-Pascal Lefaucheur
655,Sarah L Master,"Multiple neurocognitive systems contribute simultaneously to learning. For example, dopamine and basal ganglia (BG) systems are thought to support reinforcement learning (RL) by incrementally updating the value of choices, while the prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributes different computations, such as actively maintaining precise information in working memory (WM). It is commonly thought that WM and PFC show more protracted development than RL and BG systems, yet their contributions are rarely assessed in tandem. Here, we used a simple learning task to test how RL and WM contribute to changes in learning across adolescence. We tested 187 subjects ages 8 to 17 and 53 adults (25-30). Participants learned stimulus-action associations from feedback; the learning load was varied to be within or exceed WM capacity. Participants age 8-12 learned slower than participants age 13-17, and were more sensitive to load. We used computational modeling to estimate subjects' use of WM and RL processes. Surprisingly, we found more protracted changes in RL than WM during development. RL learning rate increased with age until age 18 and WM parameters showed more subtle, gender- and puberty-dependent changes early in adolescence. These results can inform education and intervention strategies based on the developmental science of learning.",Maria K Eckstein;Neta Gotlieb;Ronald Dahl;Linda Wilbrecht;Anne G E Collins
656,Christiane S Rohr,"Behavioral self-regulation develops rapidly during childhood and struggles in this area can have lifelong negative outcomes. Challenges with self-regulation are common to several neurodevelopmental conditions, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Little is known about the neural expression of behavioral regulation in children with and without neurodevelopmental conditions. We examined whole-brain brain functional correlations (FC) and behavioral regulation through connectome predictive modelling (CPM). CPM is a data-driven protocol for developing predictive models of brain-behavior relationships and assessing their potential as 'neuromarkers' using cross-validation. The data stems from the ABIDE II and comprises 276 children with and without ASD (8-13 years). We identified networks whose FC predicted individual differences in behavioral regulation. These network models predicted novel individuals' inhibition and shifting from FC data in both a leave-one-out, and split halves, cross-validation. We observed commonalities and differences, with inhibition relying on more posterior networks, shifting relying on more anterior networks, and both involving regions of the DMN. Our findings substantially add to our knowledge on the neural expressions of inhibition and shifting across children with and without a neurodevelopmental condition. Given the numerous behavioral issues that can be quantified dimensionally, refinement of whole-brain neuromarker techniques may prove useful in the future.",Shanty Kamal;Signe Bray
657,Melda Arslan,"The own name is a salient stimulus, used by others to initiate social interaction. Typically developing infants orient towards the sound of their own name and exhibit enhanced event-related potentials (ERP) at 5 months. The lack of orientation to the own name is considered to be one of the earliest signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, we investigated ERPs to hearing the own name in infants at high and low risk for ASD, at 10 and 14 months. We hypothesized that low-risk infants would exhibit enhanced frontal ERP responses to their own name compared to an unfamiliar name, while high-risk infants were expected to show attenuation or absence of this difference in their ERP responses. In contrast to expectations, we did not find enhanced ERPs to own name in the low-risk group. However, the high-risk group exhibited attenuated frontal positive-going activity to their own name compared to an unfamiliar name and compared to the low-risk group, at the age of 14 months. These results suggest that infants at high risk for ASD start to process their own name differently shortly after one year of age, a period when frontal brain development is happening at a fast rate.",Petra Warreyn;Nele Dewaele;Jan R Wiersema;Ellen Demurie;Herbert Roeyers
658,Joshua K Lee,"Relational memory improves during middle childhood and adolescence, yet the neural correlates underlying those improvements are debated. Although memory for spatial, temporal, and other associative relations requires the hippocampus, it is not established whether within-individual changes in hippocampal structure contribute to memory improvements from middle childhood into adolescence. Here, we investigated how structural changes in hippocampal head, body, and tail subregions predict improvements in the capacity to remember item-space, item-time, and item-item relations. Memory for each relation and volumes of hippocampal subregions were assessed longitudinally in 171 participants across 3 time points (Mage at T1 = 9.45 years; Mage at T2 = 10.86 years, Mage at T3 = 12.12 years; comprising 393 behavioral assessments and 362 structural scans). Among older children, volumetric growth in: (a) head and body predicted improvements in item-time memory, (b) head predicted improvements in item-item memory; and (c) right tail predicted improvements in item-space memory. The present research establishes that changes in hippocampal structure are related to improvements in relational memory, and that sub-regional changes in hippocampal volume differentially predict changes in different aspects of relational memory. These findings underscore a division of labor along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus during child development.",Yana Fandakova;Elliott G Johnson;Neal J Cohen;Silvia A Bunge;Simona Ghetti
659,Paige M Dexter,"Inherited retinal degenerations originate from mutations in >300 genes, many of which cause the production of misfolded mutant photoreceptor proteins that are ultimately degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). It was previously shown that rod photoreceptors in multiple mouse models of retinal degeneration suffer from proteostatic stress consisting of an insufficient cellular capacity for degrading UPS substrates. In this study, we focused on a specific UPS component required for the degradation of a subset of proteasome targets: the substrate-processing complex formed by the AAA+ ATPase P97/VCP and associated cofactors. To assess whether P97 capacity may be insufficient in degenerating rods, we employed two complementary in vivo proteasomal activity reporters whose degradation is either P97-dependent or P97-independent. Retinal accumulation of each reporter was measured in two models of retinal degeneration: the transducin γ-subunit knockout (Gγ ) and P23H rhodopsin knockin (P23H) mice. Strikingly, the patterns of reporter accumulation differed between these models, indicating that the proteostatic stress observed in Gγ and P23H rods likely originates from different pathobiological mechanisms, in which UPS substrate degradation may or may not be limited by P97-dependent substrate processing. Further, we assessed whether P97 overexpression could ameliorate pathology in Gγ mice, in which proteostatic stress appears to result from P97 insufficiency. However, despite P97 overexpression being aphenotypic in other tissues, the ∼2.4-fold increase in retinal P97 content was toxic to rods, which complicated the interpretation of the observed phenotype. Our results highlight the complexity of pathophysiological mechanisms related to degrading misfolded proteins in mutant photoreceptors.Significance Statement Many mutations linked to inherited retinal degenerations cause the production of misfolded photoreceptor proteins, which overwhelms the capacity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in affected photoreceptors and causes proteostatic stress. This stress has been shown to be a major factor contributing to photoreceptor cell death in multiple mouse models of retinal degeneration. Here, we show that proteostatic stress in two common retinal degeneration models results from insufficient capacities of distinct components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These results highlight the complexity of pathophysiological mechanisms related to degrading misfolded proteins in mutant photoreceptors, which must be accounted for in the development of effective strategies to ameliorate these blinding conditions.",Ekaterina S Lobanova;Stella Finkelstein;Vadim Y Arshavsky
660,Luis M Colon-Perez,"The functional connectome reflects a network architecture enabling adaptive behavior that becomes vulnerable in advanced age. The cellular mechanisms that contribute to altered functional connectivity in old age, however, are not known. Here we used a multi-scale imaging approach to link age-related changes in the functional connectome to altered expression of the activity-dependent immediate-early gene Arc as a function of training to multi-task on a working memory/bi-conditional association task (WM/BAT). Resting state fMRI data were collected from young and aged rats longitudinally at three different timepoints during cognitive training. After imaging, rats performed the WM/BAT and were immediately sacrificed to examine expression levels of Arc during task performance. Aged behaviorally-impaired, but not young, rats had a subnetwork of increased connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal striatum (DS) that was correlated with the use of a suboptimal response-based strategy during cognitive testing. Moreover, while young rats had stable rich club organization across three scanning sessions, the rich club organization of old rats increased with cognitive training. In a control group of young and aged rats that were longitudinally scanned at similar time intervals, but without cognitive training, ACC-DS connectivity and rich club organization did not change between scans in either age group. These findings suggest that aberrant large-scale functional connectivity in aged animals is associated with altered cellular activity patterns within individual brain regions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cognitive decline is frequently observed in advanced age. Although impairments in older adults have been linked to alterations in resting state brain connectivity, how these changes relate to the neurobiology of individual neurons is unknown. The current study reports longitudinal changes in the functional connectome of aged rats with cognitive training that were not observed in young animals with better task performance. These network alterations in old age were associated with poorer task performance and increased Arc expression in the dorsal striatum. This work is significant because it links functional organization of brain networks to behavioral impairments and changes within individual neurons, providing a potential bridge between invasive cell-based analyses in animal models to imaging data from human study participants.",Sean M Turner;Katelyn N Lubke;Marjory Pompilus;Marcelo Febo;Sara N Burke
661,Dylan Deska-Gauthier,"Neuronal diversity provides the spinal cord with the functional flexibility required to perform complex motor tasks. Spinal neurons arise during early embryonic development with the establishment of spatially and molecularly discrete progenitor domains that give rise to distinct, but highly heterogeneous, post-mitotic interneuron (IN) populations. Our previous studies have shown that Sim1-expressing V3 INs, originating from the p3 progenitor domain, are anatomically and physiologically divergent. However, the developmental logic guiding V3 subpopulation diversity remains elusive. In specific cases of other IN classes, neurogenesis timing can play a role in determining the ultimate fates and unique characteristics of distinctive subpopulations. To examine whether neurogenesis timing contributes to V3 diversity, we systematically investigated the temporal neurogenesis profiles of V3 INs in the mouse spinal cord. Our work uncovered that V3 INs were organized into either early-born (E9.5-E10.5) or late-born (E11.5-E12.5) neurogenic waves. Early-born V3 INs displayed both ascending and descending commissural projections and clustered into subgroups across dorsoventral spinal laminae. In contrast, late-born V3 INs became fate-restricted to ventral laminae, displayed mostly descending and local commissural projections, and uniform membrane properties. Furthermore, we found that the post-mitotic transcription factor, Sim1, although expressed in all V3 INs, exclusively regulated the dorsal clustering and electrophysiological diversification of early-born, but not late-born, V3 INs, which indicates that neurogenesis timing may enable new born V3 INs to interact with different post-mitotic differentiation pathways. Thus, our work demonstrates neurogenesis timing as a developmental mechanism underlying the post-mitotic differentiation of V3 INs into distinct subpopulation assemblies.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTInterneuron (IN) diversity empowers the spinal cord with the computation flexibility required to perform appropriate sensorimotor control. As such, uncovering the developmental logic guiding spinal IN diversity is fundamental to understanding the development of movement. In our current work, through a focus on the cardinal spinal V3 IN population, we investigated the role of neurogenesis timing on IN diversity. We uncovered that V3 INs are organized into early-born (E9.5-E10.5) or late-born (E11.5-E12.5) neurogenic waves, where late-born V3 INs display increasingly restricted subpopulation fates. Next, to better understand the consequences of V3 neurogenesis timing, we investigated the time-dependent functions of the Sim1 transcription factor, which is expressed in post-mitotic V3 INs. Interestingly, Sim1 exclusively regulated the diversification of early-born, but not late-born V3 INs. Thus, our current work indicates neurogenesis timing can modulate the functions of early postmitotic transcription factors, and thus, subpopulation fate specifications.",Joanna Borowska-Fielding;Chris Jones;Ying Zhang
662,Reka Daniel,"To efficiently learn optimal behavior in complex environments, humans rely on an interplay of learning and attention. Healthy aging has been shown to independently affect both of these functions. Here, we investigate how reinforcement learning and selective attention interact during learning from trial and error across age groups. We acquired behavioral and fMRI data from older and younger adults (male and female) performing two probabilistic learning tasks with varying attention demands. While learning in the unidimensional task did not differ across age groups, older adults performed worse than younger adults in the multidimensional task, which required high levels of selective attention. Computational modeling showed that choices of older adults are better predicted by reinforcement learning than Bayesian inference, and that older adults rely more on reinforcement learning based predictions than younger adults. Conversely, a higher proportion of younger adults' choices was predicted by a computationally demanding Bayesian approach. In line with the behavioral findings, we observed no group differences in reinforcement-learning related fMRI activation. Specifically, prediction-error activation in the nucleus accumbens was similar across age groups, and numerically higher in older adults. However, activation in the default mode was less suppressed in older adults in for higher attentional task demands, and the level of suppression correlated with behavioral performance. Our results indicate that healthy aging does not significantly impair simple reinforcement learning. However, in complex environments, older adults rely more heavily on suboptimal reinforcement-learning strategies supported by the ventral striatum, whereas younger adults utilize attention processes supported by cortical networks.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTChanges in the way that healthy human aging affects how we learn to optimally behave are not well understood; it has been suggested that age-related declines in dopaminergic function may impair older adult's ability to learn from reinforcement. In the present fMRI experiment we show that learning and nucleus accumbens activation in a simple unidimensional reinforcment-learning task was not significantly affected by age. However, in a more complex multidimensional task, older adults showed worse performance and relied more on reinforcement-learning strategies than younger adults, while failing to disengage their default-mode network during learning. These results imply that older adults are only impaired in reinforcement learning if they additionally need to learn which dimensions of the environment are currently important.1.",Angela Radulescu;Yael Niv
663,Nina L T So,"Vocal communication relies on the ability of listeners to identify, process, and respond to vocal sounds produced by others in complex environments. In order to accurately recognize these signals, animals' auditory systems must robustly represent acoustic features that distinguish vocal sounds from other environmental sounds. Vocalizations typically have spectral structure; power regularly fluctuates along the frequency axis, creating spectral contrast. Spectral contrast is closely related to harmonicity, which refers to spectral power peaks occurring at integer multiples of a fundamental frequency. While both spectral contrast and harmonicity typify natural sounds, they may differ in salience for communication behavior and engage distinct neural mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to understand which of these properties of vocal sounds underlie the neural processing and perception of vocalizations.Here, we test the importance of vocalization-typical spectral features in behavioral recognition and neural processing of vocal sounds, using male zebra finches. We show that behavioral responses to natural and synthesized vocalizations rely on the presence of discrete frequency components, but not on harmonic ratios between frequencies. We identify a specific population of neurons in primary auditory cortex that are sensitive to the spectral resolution of vocal sounds. We find that behavioral and neural response selectivity is explained by sensitivity to spectral contrast rather than harmonicity. This selectivity emerges within the cortex; it is absent in the thalamorecipient region and present in the deep output region. Further, deep-region neurons that are contrast-sensitive show distinct temporal responses and selectivity for modulation density compared to unselective neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAuditory coding and perception are critical for vocal communication. Auditory neurons must encode acoustic features that distinguish vocalizations from other sounds in the environment and generate percepts that direct behavior. The acoustic features that drive neural and behavioral selectivity for vocal sounds are unknown, however. Here, we show that vocal response behavior scales with stimulus spectral contrast but not with harmonicity, in songbirds. We identify a distinct population of auditory cortex neurons in which response selectivity parallels behavioral selectivity. This neural response selectivity is explained by sensitivity to spectral contrast rather than to harmonicity. Our findings inform the understanding of how the auditory system encodes socially-relevant signals via detection of an acoustic feature that is ubiquitous in vocalizations.",Jacob A Edwards;Sarah M N Woolley
664,Shu-Guang Kuai,"When moving around in the world, the human visual system uses both motion and form information to estimate the direction of self-motion (i.e., heading). However, little is known about cortical areas in charge of this task. This brain-imaging study addressed this question by using visual stimuli consisting of randomly distributed dot pairs oriented toward a locus on a screen (the form-defined focus of expansion (FoE)) but moved away from a different locus (the motion-defined FoE) to simulate observer translation. We first fixed the motion-defined FoE location and shifted the form-defined FoE location. We then made the locations of the motion- and the form-defined FoEs either congruent (at the same location in the display) or incongruent (on the opposite sides of the display). The motion- or the form-defined FoE shift was the same in the two types of stimuli but the perceived heading direction shifted for the congruent but not the incongruent stimuli. Participants (both sexes) made a task-irrelevant (contrast discrimination) judgment during scanning. Searchlight and region-of-interest based multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed that early visual areas V1, V2, and V3 responded to either the motion- or the form-defined FoE shift. After V3, only the dorsal areas V3a and V3B/KO responded to such shifts. Furthermore, area V3B/KO shows a highly significant higher decoding accuracy for the congruent than the incongruent stimuli. Our results provide direct evidence showing area V3B/KO does not simply respond to motion and form cues but integrate these two cues for the perception of heading.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHuman survival relies on accurate perception of self-motion. The visual system uses both motion (optic flow) and form cues for the perception of the direction of self-motion (heading). Although human brain areas for processing optic flow and form structure are well identified, the areas responsible for integrating these two cues for the perception of self-motion remain unknown. We conducted fMRI experiments and used MVPA analysis technique to find human brain areas that can decode the shift in heading specified by each cue alone and the two cues combined. We found that motion and form information are first processed in the early visual areas and then are likely integrated in the higher dorsal area V3B/KO for the final estimation of heading.",Zhou-Kui-Dong Shan;Jing Chen;Zhe-Xin Xu;Jia-Mei Li;David T Field;Li Li
665,David V C Brito,"Age-related memory loss is observed across multiple mammalian species and preferentially affects hippocampus-dependent memory. Memory impairments are characterized by accelerated decay of spatial memories. Nevertheless the molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the expression and function of the growth arrest DNA damage (Gadd45) family during aging and cognition, respectively. We report that aging impairs the expression of Gadd45γ in the hippocampus of cognitively impaired male mice. Mimicking this decrease in young adult male mice led to age-like memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Gadd45γ reduction impaired the activity of key components of the MAPK pathway (p38 and JNK) in mouse hippocampal cultures. Furthermore we found that activation of downstream targets, such as ATF-2, c-Jun and CREB was disrupted. Finally, we showed that Gadd45γ is required for induction of key early- and late-response genes that have been associated with aging. Together, these findings indicate that Gadd45γ expression regulates cognitive abilities and synapse-to-nucleus communication, and suggest Gadd45γ dysfunction as a potential mechanism contributing to age-related cognitive impairments.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA high percentage of subjects experience age-related memory loss that burdens daily performance. Although many advances have been made, the precise changes in the brain governing these deficits are unclear. Identifying molecular processes that are required for cognition and are altered during old age is crucial to develop preventive or therapeutic strategies. Here we show that baseline and learning-induced expression of the growth arrest DNA damage (Gadd45) γ is selectively impaired in the hippocampus of aged mice with cognitive deficits. Next, we show that modeling this impairment in young adult mice with normal cognitive performance disrupts long-and short-term memories in an aged-like manner. Finally, we demonstrate that Gadd45γ regulates synapse-to-nucleus communication processes that are needed for plasticity-associated gene expression.",Janina Kupke;Kubra Gulmez Karaca;Benjamin Zeuch;Ana M M Oliveira
666,Rose A Cooper,"The hallmark of episodic memory is recollecting multiple perceptual details tied to a specific spatial-temporal context. To remember an event, it is therefore necessary to integrate such details into a coherent representation during initial encoding. Here we tested how the brain encodes and binds multiple, distinct kinds of features in parallel, and how this process evolves over time during the event itself. We analyzed data from 27 human subjects (16 females, 11 males) who learned a series of objects uniquely associated with a color, a panoramic scene location, and an emotional sound while functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected. By modeling how brain activity relates to memory for upcoming or just-viewed information, we were able to test how the neural signatures of individual features as well as the integrated event changed over the course of encoding. We observed a striking dissociation between early and late encoding processes: left inferior frontal and visuo-perceptual signals at the onset of an event tracked the amount of detail subsequently recalled and were dissociable based on distinct remembered features. In contrast, memory-related brain activity shifted to the left hippocampus toward the end of an event, which was particularly sensitive to binding item color and sound associations with spatial information. These results provide evidence of early, simultaneous feature-specific neural responses during episodic encoding that predict later remembering and suggest that the hippocampus integrates these features into a coherent experience at an event transition.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUnderstanding and remembering complex experiences is crucial for many socio-cognitive abilities, including being able to navigate our environment, predict the future, and share experiences with others. Probing the neural mechanisms by which features become bound into meaningful episodes is a vital part of understanding how we view and reconstruct the rich detail of our environment. By testing memory for multimodal events, our findings show a functional dissociation between early encoding processes that engage lateral frontal and sensory regions to successfully encode event features, and later encoding processes that recruit hippocampus to bind these features together. These results highlight the importance of considering the temporal dynamics of encoding processes supporting multimodal event representations.",Maureen Ritchey

To describe the neuropathologic features and the molecular data of phosphorylated tau (pTau) in a new case of anti-IgLON5 disease.


METHODS
Review of clinical data, postmortem neuropathologic examination. Biochemical analyses of pTau were performed in brain samples from the present case and from a previously described patient with anti-IgLON5 with the characteristic brainstem tauopathy.


RESULTS
The patient was a 71-year-old man with a clinical syndrome consisting of sleep disturbance and bulbar symptoms. IgLON5 antibodies of predominant IgG4 subtype were detected in serum and CSF. He carried the HLA DRB1*10:01-DQB1*05:01 haplotype. Despite treatment with IV immunoglobulins, he unexpectedly died during sleep 2 years after disease onset. Histology showed neurofibrillary pathology and β-amyloid deposits consistent with Alzheimer disease (AD) of intermediate severity. pTau deposits were absent in the brainstem. There were few perivascular CD8+ T-cell infiltrates in the posterior hypothalamus, amygdala, and brainstem with microglial activation. The pTau immunoblot showed a pattern of bands consistent with AD, which was different from that observed in the patient with anti-IgLON5 with brainstem tauopathy who presented a differential band around 56 KDa.


CONCLUSION
The absence of pTau deposits in the brainstem of the present patient suggests that the tauopathy of patients with anti-IgLON5 disease may be a late, secondary event. The anti-IgLON5 brainstem tauopathy has a specific molecular signature different from primary tauopathies. pTau deposits restricted to the hippocampus/limbic regions of patients with anti-IgLON5 may represent an age-related comorbidity.",Lidia Sabater;Laura Martínez;María Herrera;Aiora Ostolaza;Iñaki García de Gurtubay;Teresa Tuñón;Francesc Graus;Ellen Gelpi
668,Nora Möhn,"OBJECTIVE
The use of alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody has changed the therapy of highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Alemtuzumab infusion depletes most lymphocytes in peripheral blood, whereas differential recovery of immune cells, probably those with a less CNS-autoreactive phenotype, is supposed to underlie its long-lasting effects. To determine whether alemtuzumab significantly reduces immunoglobulin levels in blood and CSF of treated patients, we analyzed blood and CSF samples of 38 patients with MS treated with alemtuzumab regarding changes in immunoglobulin levels.


METHODS
Blood and CSF samples of patients were collected at the beginning of alemtuzumab treatment and at 12, 24, and 36 months after the first administration of the drug. Specimens were analyzed regarding immunoglobulin concentrations in blood and CSF.


RESULTS
We observed significant and dose-dependent reductions of immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM, and IgA) in serum and CSF 12 and 24 months following 2 courses of alemtuzumab. Patients with persistent or returning disease activity who were treated with a third course of alemtuzumab exhibited even further decrease in IgG levels compared with matched controls treated twice. Here, alemtuzumab-treated patients with IgG levels below the lower limits of normal were more susceptible to pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis, whereas upper respiratory tract and urinary tract infections were not associated therewith.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest to monitor IgG levels for safety reasons in patients treated with alemtuzumab-in particular when additional treatment courses are required-and to consider preventive action in critical cases.

This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with RRMS alemtuzumab reduces immunoglobulin levels.",Steffen Pfeuffer;Tobias Ruck;Catharina C Gross;Thomas Skripuletz;Luisa Klotz;Heinz Wiendl;Martin Stangel;Sven G Meuth

To report the presence of a new neuronal surface antibody against the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 antibody (mGluR2-Ab) in 2 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia.


METHODS
mGluR2-Abs were initially characterized by immunohistochemistry on the rat brain and confirmed by immunofluorescence on HEK293 cells transfected with mGluR2. Additional studies included analysis of potential cross-reactivity with other mGluRs, expression of mGluR2 in patients' tumors, and the effects of mGluR2-Abs on cultures of rat hippocampal neurons.


RESULTS
Patient 1 was a 78-year-old woman with progressive cerebellar ataxia with an initial relapsing-remitting course who developed a small-cell tumor of unknown origin. Patient 2 was a 3-year-old girl who presented a steroid-responsive acute cerebellitis preceding the diagnosis of an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Patients' serum and CSF showed a characteristic immunostaining of the hippocampus and cerebellum in rat brain sections and immunolabeled the cell surface of live rat hippocampal neurons. HEK293 cells transfected with mGluR1, 2, 3, and 5 confirmed that patients' antibodies only recognized mGluR2. mGluR2-Abs were not detected in 160 controls, 120 with paraneoplastic, autoimmune, or degenerative ataxias, and 40 with autoimmune encephalitis and antibodies against mGluR5 or unknown antigens. Expression of mGluR2 in tumors was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using a commercial mGluR2-Ab. Incubation of live rat hippocampal neurons with CSF of patient 2 did not modify the density of surface mGluR2 clusters.


CONCLUSIONS
mGluR2-Abs are a novel biomarker of paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia. The potential pathogenic effect of the antibodies is not mediated by downregulation or internalization of neuronal surface mGluR2.",Eugenia Martínez-Hernández;Bastien Joubert;Mar Petit-Pedrol;Elena Pajarón-Boix;Verónica Fernández;Lidia Salais;María Del Pozo;Thais Armangué;Lidia Sabater;Josep Dalmau;Francesc Graus
670,Lue Zhou,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the associations of sleep duration, midday napping, sleep quality, and change in sleep duration with risk of incident stroke and stroke subtypes.


METHODS
Among 31,750 participants aged 61.7 years on average at baseline from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort, we used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident stroke.


RESULTS
Compared with sleeping 7 to <8 hours/night, those reporting longer sleep duration (≥9 hours/night) had a greater risk of total stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.41), while shorter sleep (<6 hours/night) had no significant effect on stroke risk. The HR (95% CI) of total stroke was 1.25 (1.03-1.53) for midday napping >90 minutes vs 1-30 minutes. The results were similar for ischemic stroke. Compared with good sleep quality, those with poor sleep quality showed a 29%, 28%, and 56% higher risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Moreover, we observed significant joint effects of sleeping ≥9 hours/night and midday napping >90 minutes (HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.28-2.66), and sleeping ≥9 hours/night and poor sleep quality (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.33-2.48) on risk of total stroke. Furthermore, compared with persistently sleeping 7-9 hours/night, those who persistently slept ≥9 hours/night or switched from 7 to 9 hours to ≥9 hours/night had a higher risk of total stroke.


CONCLUSIONS
Long sleep duration, long midday napping, and poor sleep quality were independently and jointly associated with higher risks of incident stroke. Persistently long sleep duration or switch from average to long sleep duration increased the risk of stroke.",Kuai Yu;Liangle Yang;Hao Wang;Yang Xiao;Gaokun Qiu;Xuezhen Liu;Yu Yuan;Yansen Bai;Xiulou Li;Handong Yang;Meian He;Chongjian Wang;Tangchun Wu;Xiaomin Zhang
671,Andrea Cortese,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effectiveness of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels in achieving a molecular diagnosis in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and related disorders in a clinical setting.


METHODS
We prospectively enrolled 220 patients from 2 tertiary referral centers, one in London, United Kingdom (n = 120), and one in Iowa (n = 100), in whom a targeted CMT NGS panel had been requested as a diagnostic test. PMP22 duplication/deletion was previously excluded in demyelinating cases. We reviewed the genetic and clinical data upon completion of the diagnostic process.


RESULTS
After targeted NGS sequencing, a definite molecular diagnosis, defined as a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, was reached in 30% of cases (n = 67). The diagnostic rate was similar in London (32%) and Iowa (29%). Variants of unknown significance were found in an additional 33% of cases. Mutations in GJB1, MFN2, and MPZ accounted for 39% of cases that received genetic confirmation, while the remainder of positive cases had mutations in diverse genes, including SH3TC2, GDAP1, IGHMBP2, LRSAM1, FDG4, and GARS, and another 12 less common genes. Copy number changes in PMP22, MPZ, MFN2, SH3TC2, and FDG4 were also accurately detected. A definite genetic diagnosis was more likely in cases with an early onset, a positive family history of neuropathy or consanguinity, and a demyelinating neuropathy.


CONCLUSIONS
NGS panels are effective tools in the diagnosis of CMT, leading to genetic confirmation in one-third of cases negative for PMP22 duplication/deletion, thus highlighting how rarer and previously undiagnosed subtypes represent a relevant part of the genetic landscape of CMT.",Janel E Wilcox;James M Polke;Roy Poh;Mariola Skorupinska;Alexander M Rossor;Matilde Laura;Pedro J Tomaselli;Henry Houlden;Michael E Shy;Mary M Reilly
672,Jos Oudeman,"OBJECTIVE
To assess and compare the diagnostic performance of qualitative and (semi-)quantitative MRI and ultrasound for distinguishing chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) from segmental spinal muscular atrophy (sSMA).


METHODS
Patients with CIDP (n = 13), MMN (n = 10), or sSMA (n = 12) and healthy volunteers (n = 30) were included. MRI of the brachial plexus, using short tau inversion recovery (STIR), nerve-specific T2-weighted (magnetic resonance neurography [MRN]), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences, was evaluated. Furthermore, with ultrasound, cross-sectional areas of the nerves were evaluated. Three radiologists blinded for diagnosis qualitatively scored hypertrophy and increased signal intensity (STIR and MRN), and intraobserver and interobserver agreement was assessed. For the (semi-)quantitative modalities, group differences and receiver operator characteristics were calculated.


RESULTS
Hypertrophy and increased signal intensity were found in all groups including healthy controls. Intraobserver and interobserver agreements varied considerably (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.00-0.811 and 0.101-0.491, respectively). DTI showed significant differences (p < 0.05) among CIDP, MMN, sSMA, and controls for fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in the brachial plexus. Ultrasound showed significant differences in cross-sectional area (p < 0.05) among CIDP, MMN, and sSMA in upper arm and brachial plexus. For distinguishing immune-mediated neuropathies (CIDP and MMN) from sSMA, ultrasound yielded the highest area under the curve (0.870).


CONCLUSION
Qualitative assessment of hypertrophy and signal hyperintensity on STIR or MRN is of limited value. DTI measures may discriminate among CIDP, MMN, and sSMA. Currently, ultrasound may be the most appropriate diagnostic imaging aid in the clinical setting.",Filip Eftimov;Gustav J Strijkers;Joppe J Schneiders;Stefan D Roosendaal;Maurits P Engbersen;Martijn Froeling;H Stephan Goedee;Pieter A van Doorn;Matthan W A Caan;Ivo N van Schaik;Mario Maas;Aart J Nederveen;Marianne de Visser;Camiel Verhamme
673,Ruth Peters,"OBJECTIVE
High blood pressure is one of the main modifiable risk factors for dementia. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the best antihypertensive class for optimizing cognition. Our objective was to determine whether any particular antihypertensive class was associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline or dementia using comprehensive meta-analysis including reanalysis of original participant data.


METHODS
To identify suitable studies, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO and preexisting study consortia were searched from inception to December 2017. Authors of prospective longitudinal human studies or trials of antihypertensives were contacted for data sharing and collaboration. Outcome measures were incident dementia or incident cognitive decline (classified using the reliable change index method). Data were separated into mid and late-life (>65 years) and each antihypertensive class was compared to no treatment and to treatment with other antihypertensives. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data.


RESULTS
Over 50,000 participants from 27 studies were included. Among those aged >65 years, with the exception of diuretics, we found no relationship by class with incident cognitive decline or dementia. Diuretic use was suggestive of benefit in some analyses but results were not consistent across follow-up time, comparator group, and outcome. Limited data precluded meaningful analyses in those ≤65 years of age.


CONCLUSION
Our findings, drawn from the current evidence base, support clinical freedom in the selection of antihypertensive regimens to achieve blood pressure goals.

674,Steven M Greenberg,"The shared role of amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer disease (AD) is arguably the clearest instance of crosstalk between neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular processes. The pathogenic pathways of CAA and AD intersect at the levels of Aβ generation, its circulation within the interstitial fluid and perivascular drainage pathways and its brain clearance, but diverge in their mechanisms of brain injury and disease presentation. Here, we review the evidence for and the pathogenic implications of interactions between CAA and AD. Both pathologies seem to be driven by impaired Aβ clearance, creating conditions for a self-reinforcing cycle of increased vascular Aβ, reduced perivascular clearance and further CAA and AD progression. Despite the close relationship between vascular and plaque Aβ deposition, several factors favour one or the other, such as the carboxy-terminal site of the peptide and specific co-deposited proteins. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities that have been seen in trials of anti-Aβ immunotherapy are another probable intersection between CAA and AD, representing overload of perivascular clearance pathways and the effects of removing Aβ from CAA-positive vessels. The intersections between CAA and AD point to a crucial role for improving vascular function in the treatment of both diseases and indicate the next steps necessary for identifying therapies.",Brian J Bacskai;Mar Hernandez-Guillamon;Jeremy Pruzin;Reisa Sperling;Susanne J van Veluw

Barriers inherent in service systems for autism can hinder parents from getting help for their children, and this is probably especially true for immigrant parents. In order to provide accessible assessment and interventions for preschool children with autism, a multidisciplinary team was established in one district of a Swedish city, with a majority population of immigrants.


Aim
The aim of the present study was to gain knowledge of the parents' experiences of participating in the community assessment and intervention program.


Methods and procedures
A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was conducted with parents of 11 children aged 3-5, who had been diagnosed with autism and participated in the community intervention program for at least 1 year. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and data were analyzed following a phenomenological hermeneutical method.


Results
The overall meaning of the parents' narratives was interpreted as ""A new way of understanding my child made life more hopeful and more challenging than before"". Their experience was interpreted as a process, captured in the three main themes: ""An overwhelming diagnosis"", ""Cooperating with the team"", and ""Growing as a parent"".


Conclusion
As lacking knowledge of available resources and support seems to be an important barrier to access services, the results underscore the importance of providing individually tailored services including comprehensive societal support to immigrant families with young children suffering from autism. The study also highlights the importance of addressing the parents' previous awareness and knowledge of autism early in the assessment process, as well as continually involving parents in the intervention program, and this may enhance parental growth.",Marianne Jingrot;Petra Linnsand;Christopher Gillberg;Gudrun Nygren
676,Efat Sadeghian,"Purpose
Despite its efficacy and safety, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is underutilized, in part, due to the stigma associated with the treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of counseling on stigma in patients with psychiatric disorders receiving ECT.


Patients and methods
A total of 114 patients with psychiatric disorders undergoing ECT were randomly divided into two groups. Both the groups received routine care and treatment, but the intervention group (n=57) received four counseling sessions. At the beginning and end of the study (6 weeks, post-treatment), patients completed the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale. The data were analyzed using independent and paired sample t-tests.


Results
There was no significant difference in the mean stigma scores of participants in the control and intervention groups before counseling (P>0.08). However, post-intervention, there was a significant difference in the mean stigma scores between both the groups (P<0.001).


Conclusion
The findings demonstrate that the counseling intervention is effective in decreasing stigma in patients undergoing ECT. Therefore, it is recommended to use this therapeutic method in such patients.",Parisa Rostami;Farshid Shamsaei;Lily Tapak

Vagal activity is critical for maintaining key body functions, including the stability of inflammatory control. Its weakening, such as in the aftermatch of a surgery, leaves the body vulnerable to diverse inflammatory conditions, including sepsis.


Methods
Vagal activity can be measured by the cardiorespiratory interaction known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia or high-frequency heart-rate variability (HRV). We examined the vagal dynamics before, during and after an orthopedic surgery. 39 patients had their HRV measured around the period of operation and during subsequent rehabilitation. Measurements were done during 24 h circadian cycles on ten specific days. For each patient, the circadian vagal activity was calculated from HRV data.


Results
Our results confirm the deteriorating effect of surgery on vagal activity. Patients with stronger pre-operative vagal activity suffer greater vagal withdrawal during the peri-operative phase, but benefit from stronger improvements during post-operative period, especially during the night. Rehabilitation seems not only to efficiently restore the vagal activity to pre-operative level, but in some cases to actually improve it.


Discussion
Our findings indicate that orthopedic rehabilitation has the potential to strengthen the vagal activity and hence boost inflammatory control. We conclude that providing a patient with a vagal reinforcement procedure prior to the surgery (""pre-habilitation"") might be a beneficial strategy against post-operative complications. The study also shows the clinical usefulness of quantifying the cardiorespiratory interactions.",Zoran Levnajić;Henry Puff;Tanja Ohland;Nandu Goswami;Matthias Frühwirth;Maximilian Moser
678,Heidi Gröhn,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method commonly used in the disciplines of neuroscience, neurology, and neuropsychiatry to examine or modulate brain function. Low frequency rTMS (e.g., 1 Hz) is associated with a net suppression of cortical excitability, whereas higher frequencies (e.g., 5 Hz) purportedly increase excitability. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) allow investigation of neurochemistry and functional connectivity, respectively, and can assess the influence of rTMS in these domains. This pilot study investigated the effects of rTMS on the primary motor cortex using pre and post MRS and rsfMRI assessments at 7 T. Seven right-handed males (age 27 ± 7 y.o.) underwent single-voxel MRS and rsfMRI before and about 30-min after rTMS was administered outside the scanner for 20-min over the primary motor cortex of the left (dominant) hemisphere. All participants received 1-Hz rTMS; one participant additionally received 5-Hz rTMS in a separate session. Concentrations of 17 neurochemicals were quantified in left and right motor cortices. Connectivity metrics included fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) of both motor cortices, strength of related brain networks, and inter-hemispheric connectivity. The group-analysis revealed few trends (i.e., uncorrected for multiple comparisons), including a mean increase in the concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) after the inhibitory rTMS protocol as compared to baseline in the stimulated (left) motor cortex (+8%, p = 0.043), along with a slight increase of total creatine (+2%, p = 0.018), and decrease of aspartate (-18%, p = 0.016). Additionally, GABA tended to decrease in the contralateral hemisphere (-6%, p = 0.033). No other changes of metabolite concentrations were found. Whereas functional connectivity outcomes did not exhibit trends of significant changes induced by rTMS, the percent changes of few connectivity metrics in both hemispheres were negatively correlated with GABA changes in the contralateral hemisphere. While studies in larger cohorts are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, our results indicate the safety and feasibility of detecting changes in key metabolites associated with neurotransmission after a single 1-Hz rTMS session, establishing the construct for future exploration of the neurochemical, and connectivity mechanisms of cortical responses to neuromodulation.",Bernadette T Gillick;Ivan Tkáč;Petr Bednařík;Daniele Mascali;Dinesh K Deelchand;Shalom Michaeli;Gregg D Meekins;Michael J Leffler-McCabe;Colum D MacKinnon;Lynn E Eberly;Silvia Mangia
679,Chen Chen,"Estimation of individuals' cognitive, behavioral and demographic (CBD) variables based on MRI has attracted much research interest in the past decade, and effective machine learning techniques are of great importance for these estimations. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is an attractive machine learning technique that can accommodate both single- and multi-label learning in a simple framework, while its potential for MRI-based estimations of CBD variables remains to be explored. In this study, we systemically investigated the performance of PLSR in MRI-based estimations of individuals' CBD variables, especially its performance in simultaneous estimation of multiple CBD variables (multi-label learning). We performed the study on the dataset included in the HCP S1200 release. Resting state functional connections (RSFCs) were used as features, and a total of 10 CBD variables (e.g., age, gender, grip strength, and picture vocabulary) were estimated. The results showed that PLSR performed well in both single- and multi-label learning. In fact, the present estimations were better than those reported in literatures, as indicated by stronger correlations between the estimated and actual CBD variables, as well as high gender classification accuracy (97.8% in this study). Moreover, the RSFCs that contributed to the estimations exhibited strong correlations with the CBD variable estimated, that is, PLSR algorithm automatically selected the RSFCs closely related to one CBD variable to establish predictive models for the variable. Besides, the estimation accuracies based on RSFCs among 100, 200, and 300 regions of interest (ROIs) were higher than those based on RSFCs among 15, 25, and 50 ROIs; the estimation accuracies based on RSFCs evaluated using partial correlation were higher than those based on RSFCs evaluated using full correlation. In addition to the aforementioned virtues, PLSR is efficient in model training and testing, and it is simple and easy to use. Therefore, PLSR can be a favorable choice for future MRI-based estimations of CBD variables.",Xuyu Cao;Lixia Tian
680,Carsten Simons,"Neuronal Ca2+ sensor proteins (NCS) transduce changes in Ca2+ homeostasis into altered signaling and neuronal function. NCS-1 activity has emerged as important for neuronal viability and pathophysiology. The progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, particularly within the Substantia nigra (SN), is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), causing its motor symptoms. The activity-related Ca2+ homeostasis of SN DA neurons, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic stress promote neurodegeneration and PD. In contrast, NCS-1 in general has neuroprotective effects. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed transcriptional changes in SN DA neurons upon NCS-1 loss by combining UV-laser microdissection and RT-qPCR-approaches to compare expression levels of a panel of PD and/or Ca2+-stress related genes from wildtype and NCS-1 KO mice. In NCS-1 KO, we detected significantly lower mRNA levels of mitochondrially coded ND1, a subunit of the respiratory chain, and of the neuron-specific enolase ENO2, a glycolytic enzyme. We also detected lower levels of the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins UCP4 and UCP5, the PARK7 gene product DJ-1, and the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel Cav2.3 in SN DA neurons from NCS-1 KO. Transcripts of other analyzed uncoupling proteins (UCPs), mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters, PARK genes, and ion channels were not altered. As Cav channels are linked to regulation of gene expression, metabolic stress and degeneration of SN DA neurons in PD, we analyzed Cav2.3 KO mice, to address if the transcriptional changes in NCS-1 KO were also present in Cav.2.3 KO, and thus probably correlated with lower Cav2.3 transcripts. However, in SN DA neurons from Cav2.3 KO mice, ND1 mRNA as well as genomic DNA levels were elevated, while ENO2, UCP4, UCP5, and DJ-1 transcript levels were not altered. In conclusion, our data indicate a possible novel function of NCS-1 in regulating gene transcription or stabilization of mRNAs in SN DA neurons. Although we do not provide functional data, our findings at the transcript level could point to impaired ATP production (lower ND1 and ENO2) and elevated metabolic stress (lower UCP4, UCP5, and DJ-1 levels) in SN DA neurons from NCS-1 KO mice. We speculate that NCS-1 is involved in stimulating ATP synthesis, while at the same time controlling mitochondrial metabolic stress, and in this way could protect SN DA neurons from degeneration.",Julia Benkert;Nora Deuter;Christina Poetschke;Olaf Pongs;Toni Schneider;Johanna Duda;Birgit Liss
681,Lucia Ciranna,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) modulates glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain area with a key role in learning and memory. In agreement, several studies have demonstrated that PACAP modulates learning in physiological conditions. Recent publications show reduced PACAP levels and/or alterations in PACAP receptor expression in different conditions associated with cognitive disability. It is noteworthy that PACAP administration rescued impaired synaptic plasticity and learning in animal models of aging, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's chorea. In this context, results from our laboratory demonstrate that PACAP rescued metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), a genetic form of intellectual disability. PACAP is actively transported through the blood-brain barrier and reaches the brain following intranasal or intravenous administration. Besides, new studies have identified synthetic PACAP analog peptides with improved selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties with respect to the native peptide. Our review supports the shared idea that pharmacological activation of PACAP receptors might be beneficial for brain pathologies with cognitive disability. In addition, we suggest that the effects of PACAP treatment might be further studied as a possible therapy in FXS.",Lara Costa

683,Xuewen Wu,"Connexins (Cxs) are ubiquitous membrane proteins that are found throughout vertebrate organs, acting as building blocks of the gap junctions (GJs) known to play vital roles in the normal function of many organs. Mutations in Cx genes (particularly GJB2, which encodes Cx26) cause approximately half of all cases of congenital hearing loss in newborns. Great progress has been made in understanding GJ function and the molecular mechanisms for the role of Cxs in the cochlea. Data reveal that multiple types of Cxs work together to ensure normal development and function of the cochlea. These findings include many aspects not proposed in the classic K+ recycling theory, such as the formation of normal cochlear morphology (e.g., the opening of the tunnel of Corti), the fine-tuning of the innervation of nerve fibers to the hair cells (HCs), the maturation of the ribbon synapses, and the initiation of the endocochlear potential (EP). New data, especially those collected from targeted modification of major Cx genes in the mouse cochlea, have demonstrated that Cx26 plays an essential role in the postnatal maturation of the cochlea. Studies also show that Cx26 and Cx30 assume very different roles in the EP generation, given that only Cx26 is required for normal hearing. This article will review our current understanding of the molecular structure, cellular distribution, and major functions of cochlear GJs. Potential implications of the knowledge of cochlear GJs on the design and implementation of translational studies of cochlear gene therapies for Cx mutations are also discussed.",Wenjuan Zhang;Yihui Li;Xi Lin
684,Christine Ibrahim,"The insular cortex has been linked to a multitude of functions. In contrast, the nearby claustrum is a densely connected subcortical region with unclear function. To view the insula-claustrum region from the molecular perspective we analyzed the transcriptomic profile of these areas in six adult and four fetal human brains. We identified marker genes with specific expression and performed transcriptome-wide tests for enrichment of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. In addition, specific insular and claustral expression of genes pertaining to diseases, addiction, and depression was tested. At the anatomical level, we used brain-wide analyses to determine the specificity of our results and to determine the transcriptomic similarity of the insula-claustrum region. We found UCMA to be the most significantly enriched gene in the insular cortex and confirmed specific expression of NR4A2, NTNG2, and LXN in the claustrum. Furthermore, the insula was found to have enriched expression of genes associated with mood disorders, learning, cardiac muscle contraction, oxygen transport, glutamate and dopamine signaling. Specific expression in the claustrum was enriched for genes pertaining to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe intellectual disability, epileptic encephalopathy, intracellular transport, spine development, and macroautophagy. We tested for enrichment of genes related to addiction and depression, but they were generally not highly specific to the insula-claustrum region. Exceptions include high insular expression of genes linked to cocaine abuse and genes associated with ever smoking in the claustrum. Brain-wide, we find that markers of the adult claustrum are most specifically expressed in the fetal and adult insula. Altogether, our results provide a novel molecular perspective on the unique properties of the insula and claustrum.",Bernard Le Foll;Leon French

Relatively little attention has been directed toward possible compartmentalization of the claustrum complex into anatomical subdivisions, and how this compartmentalization is reflected in claustrum connections with other brain structures. In this study, we examined the cyto- and myelo-architecture of the claustrum of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), to determine whether the claustrum contains internal anatomical structures or compartments, which could facilitate studies focused on understanding its role in brain function. NeuN, Nissl, calbindin, parvalbumin, and myelin-stained sections from eight adult marmosets were studied using light microscopy and serial reconstruction to identify potential internal compartments. Ultra high resolution (9.4T) post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging was employed to identify tractographic differences between identified claustrum subcompartments by diffusion-weighted tractography. Our results indicate that the classically defined marmoset claustrum includes at least two major subdivisions, which correspond to the dorsal endopiriform and insular claustrum nuclei, as described in other species, and that the dorsal endopiriform nucleus (DEnD) contains architecturally distinct compartments. Furthermore, the dorsal subdivision of the DEnD is tractographically distinguishable from the insular claustrum with respect to cortical connections.",David K Wright;Nafiseh Atapour;Jonathan M-H Chan;Kirsty J Watkins;Katrina H Worthy;Marcello Rosa;Amy Reichelt;David H Reser
686,Nicolas Thorne,"Haptic communication between humans plays an important role in society. Although this form of communication is ubiquitous at all levels of society and of human development, little is known about how synchronized coordination of motion between two persons leads to higher-order cognitive functions used in communication. In this study, we developed a novel experimental paradigm of a coin-collecting task in which participants used their hands to control a rod to jointly collect the coins on the screen. We characterized the haptic interactions between paired participants while they were taking part in a cooperative task. The individual participants first completed this task on their own and then with a randomly assigned partner for the cooperative task. Single participant experiments were used as a baseline to compare results of the paired participants. Forces applied to the rod were translated to four possible haptic states which encode the combination of the haptic interactions. As a next step, pairs of consecutive haptic states were then combined into 16 possible haptic signals which were classified in terms of their temporal patterns using a Tsallis q-exponential function. For paired participants, 80% of the haptic signals could be fit by the Tsallis q-exponential. On the other hand, only 30% of the signals found in the single-participant trials could be fit by the Tsallis q-exponential. This shows a clear difference in the temporal structures of haptic signals when participants are interacting with each other and when they are not. We also found a large difference in the number of haptic signals used by paired participants and singles. Single participants only used 1/4 of the possible haptic signals. Paired participants, on the other hand, used more than half of the possible signals. These results suggest that temporal structures present in haptic communication could be linked to the emergence of language at an evolutionary level.",Juliane J Honisch;Toshiyuki Kondo;Slawomir Nasuto;Yoshikatsu Hayashi
687,Nadine Martin,"We propose that deficits in lexical retrieval can involve difficulty in transmission of activation between processing levels, or difficulty in maintaining activation. In support, we present an investigation of picture naming by persons with aphasia in which the naming response is generated after a 1 s (sec) cue to respond in one condition or a 5 s cue to respond in another. Some individuals did better after 5 s, some did worse after 5 s, and some were not impacted by the delay. It is suggested that better performance after 5 s indicates a transmission deficit and that worse performance after 5 s indicates a maintenance deficit. To support this hypothesis, we adapted the two-step semantic-phonological model of lexical retrieval (Schwartz et al., 2006) so that it can simulate the passage of time and can simulate lesions in transmission (its semantic and phonological connection strength parameters) and/or maintenance (its decay parameter). The naming error patterns after 1 and 5 s for each participant were successfully fit to the model. Persons who did better after 5 s were found to have low connection strength parameters, persons who did worse after 5 s were simulated with an increased decay rate, and persons whose performance did not differ with delay were found to have lesions of both types. Some potential theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.",Gary S Dell
688,Taban Eslami,"Heterogeneous mental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are notoriously difficult to diagnose, especially in children. The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioral observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to misdiagnosis. In order to move the field toward more quantitative diagnosis, we need advanced and scalable machine learning infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental health disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for classifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a single layer perceptron (SLP) which results in improved quality of extracted features and optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a data augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature vectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset provided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1, 035 subjects coming from 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms other state of the art methods from 10 imaging centers with increase in classification accuracy up to 28% with maximum accuracy of 82%. The machine learning technique presented in this paper, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time (40 min vs. 7 h on other methods).

689,Grzegorz M Wojcik,"The electroencephalographic activity of particular brain areas during the decision making process is still little known. This paper presents results of experiments on the group of 30 patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders and 41 members of the control group. All subjects were performing the Iowa Gambling Task that is often used for decision process investigations. The electroencephalographical activity of participants was recorded using the dense array amplifier. The most frequently active Brodmann Areas were estimated by means of the photogrammetry techniques and source localization algorithms. The analysis was conducted in the full frequency as well as in alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and theta bands. Next the mean electric charge flowing through each of the most frequently active areas and for each frequency band was calculated. The comparison of the results obtained for the subjects and the control groups is presented. The difference in activity of the selected Brodmann Areas can be observed in all variants of the task. The hyperactivity of amygdala is found in both the patients and the control group. It is noted that the somatosensory association cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and primary visual cortex play an important role in the decision-making process as well. Some of our results confirm the previous findings in the fMRI experiments. In addition, the results of the electroencephalographic analysis in the broadband as well as in specific frequency bands were used as inputs to several machine learning classifiers built in Azure Machine Learning environment. Comparison of classifiers' efficiency is presented to some extent and finding the most effective classifier may be important for planning research strategy toward finding decision-making biomarkers in cortical activity for both healthy people and those suffering from psychiatric disorders.",Jolanta Masiak;Andrzej Kawiak;Lukasz Kwasniewicz;Piotr Schneider;Filip Postepski;Anna Gajos-Balinska
690,André Couto Carvalho,"Background: Declining serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D, a biomarker of vitamin D status] with aging is a well-recognized phenomenon. However, scarce information is available on the relation between 25(OH)D levels and cognitive performance over time in older individuals. Our purpose was to evaluate, longitudinally, the association of 25(OH)D with cognitive function in a healthy older adults' cohort. Methods: Sixty-four individuals over 55 years-old with no cognitive impairment, clustered as healthy ""Poor"" and ""Good"" cognitive performers, were followed for an average of 18 months. Seasonal-adjusted 25(OH)D serum levels (measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) were related, longitudinally, with cognitive (memory and general/executive) composite scores. Results: Overall seasonal-adjusted median serum 25(OH)D level was of 47 nmol/l [interquartile range (IQR), 38-60 nmol/l]. A negative correlation between baseline 25(OH)D and the general/executive composite score was found in the ""Poor"" cognitive performers (r s = -0.52, p = 0.006), an association lost after adjusting 25(OH)D levels for the season. No effect was found in both groups between seasonal-adjusted 25(OH)D levels and the variation of both memory and general/executive composites during follow-up when adjusted for age, gender and education level. Conclusion: In this healthy older population with no cognitive impairment, lower serum levels of 25(OH)D were not longitudinally associated with poorer cognitive scores.",Nadine Correia Santos;Carlos Portugal-Nunes;Teresa Costa Castanho;Pedro Moreira;Patrício Soares Costa;Nuno Sousa;Joana Almeida Palha

692,Zimo Chen,"Background: Small-artery occlusion (SAO) subtype accounts for a quarter of the cases of ischemic stroke and is mainly caused by pathological changes in cerebral small vessels, which also involve in deep intracerebral hemorrhage (dICH). However, the factors that drive some cases to SAO and others to dICH remained incompletely defined. Material and Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study from the China National Stroke Registry that included consecutive patients with ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage between August 2007 and September 2008. We compared the risk profile between the two subgroups using multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 1,135 patients with SAO stroke and 1,125 dICH patients were included for analyses. Generally, patients with SAO stroke were more likely to be male (odds ratio = 0.74, confidence interval = 0.58-0.94) and have diabetes (0.30, 0.22-0.40), higher atherogenic lipid profiles, higher body mass index (0.96, 0.94-0.99), higher waist/height ratio (0.12, 0.03-0.48), higher platelet count (0.84, 0.77-0.91), and higher proportion of abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate (<90, ml/min/1.73 m2) (0.77, 0.62-0.95). Conversely, patients with dICH were more likely to have higher blood pressure parameters, inflammation levels (white blood cell count: 1.61, 1.48-1.76; high sensitivity C-reactive protein: 2.07, 1.36-3.16), and high-density lipoprotein-c (1.57, 1.25-1.98). Conclusions: The risk profile between SAO stroke and dICH were different. Furthermore, despite of traditional indexes, waist/height ratio, platelet count, inflammation levels, lipid profile, and estimated glomerular filtration rate also play important roles in driving arteriolosclerosis into opposite ends.",Jinglin Mo;Jie Xu;Haiqiang Qin;Huaguang Zheng;Yuesong Pan;Xia Meng;Jing Jing;Xianglong Xiang;Yongjun Wang
693,Ella Gabitov,"Recently, an increasing interest in investigating interactions between brain regions using functional connectivity (FC) methods has shifted the initial focus of cognitive neuroimaging research from localizing functional circuits based on task activation to mapping brain networks based on intrinsic FC dynamics. Leveraging the advantages of the latter approach, it has been shown that despite primarily invariant intrinsic organization of the large-scale functional networks, interactions between and within these networks significantly differ between various behavioral and cognitive states. These differences presumably indicate transient reconfiguration of functional connections-an instantaneous process that flexibly mediates and calibrates human behavior according to momentary demands of the environment. Nevertheless, the specificity of these reconfigured FC patterns to the task at hand and their relevance to adaptive processes during learning remain elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated (1) to what extent FC within the somatomotor network is reconfigured during motor skill practice, and (2) how these changes are related to learning. We applied a seed-driven FC approach to data collected during a continuous task-free condition, so-called resting state, and during a motor sequence learning task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. During the task, participants repeatedly performed a short five-element sequence with their non-dominant (left) hand. As predicted, such unimanual sequence production was associated with lateralized activation of the right somatomotor cortex (SMC). Using this ""active"" region as a seed, here we show that unimanual performance of the motor sequence relies on functional segregation between the two SMC and selective integration between the ""active"" SMC and supplementary motor area. Whereas, greater segregation between the two SMC was associated with gains in performance rate, greater segregation within the ""active"" SMC itself was associated with more consistent performance by the end of training. Nether the resting-state FC patterns within the somatomotor network nor their relative modulation by the task state predicted these behavioral benefits of learning. Our results suggest that task-induced FC changes reflect reconfiguration of the connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network rather than a simple amplification or silencing of its intrinsic dynamics. Such reconfiguration not only supports motor behavior but may also predict learning.",Ovidiu Lungu;Geneviève Albouy;Julien Doyon
694,Xingwang Huang,"Quantum-behaved bat algorithm with mean best position directed (QMBA) is a novel variant of bat algorithm (BA) with good performance. However, the QMBA algorithm generates all stochastic coefficients with uniform probability distribution, which can only provide a relatively small search range, so it still faces a certain degree of premature convergence. In order to help bats escape from the local optimum, this article proposes a novel Gaussian quantum bat algorithm with mean best position directed (GQMBA), which applies Gaussian probability distribution to generate random number sequences. Applying Gaussian distribution instead of uniform distribution to generate random coefficients in GQMBA is an effective technique to promote the performance in avoiding premature convergence. In this article, the combination of QMBA and Gaussian probability distribution is applied to solve the numerical function optimization problem. Nineteen benchmark functions are employed and compared with other algorithms to evaluate the accuracy and performance of GQMBA. The experimental results show that, in most cases, the proposed GQMBA algorithm can provide better search performance.",Chaopeng Li;Yunming Pu;Bingyan He
695,Ming Lu,"Seam carving is an excellent content-aware image resizing technology widely used, and it is also a means of image tampering. Once an image is seam carved, the distribution of magnitude levels for the pixel intensity differences in the local neighborhood will be changed, which can be considered as a clue for detection of seam carving for forensic purposes. In order to accurately describe the distribution of magnitude levels for the pixel intensity differences in the local neighborhood, local neighborhood magnitude occurrence pattern (LNMOP) is proposed in this paper. The LNMOP pattern describes the distribution of intensity difference by counting up the number of magnitude level occurrences in the local neighborhood. Based on this, a forensic approach for image seam carving is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the histogram features of LNMOP and HOG (histogram of oriented gradient) are extracted from the images for seam carving forgery detection. Then, the final features for the classifier are selected from the extracted LNMOP features. The LNMOP feature selection method based on HOG feature hierarchical matching is proposed, which determines the LNMOP features to be selected by the HOG feature level. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is utilized as a classifier to train and test by the above selected features to distinguish tampered images from normal images. In order to create training sets and test sets, images are extracted from the UCID image database. The experimental results of a large number of test images show that the proposed approach can achieve an overall better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches.",Shaozhang Niu

CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy, also known as hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS), is a rare white-matter encephalopathy characterized by motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms due to colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene mutation. Few of CSF1R mutations have been functionally testified and the pathogenesis remains unknown.


Methods
In order to investigate clinical and pathological characteristics of patients with CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy and explore the potential impact of CSF1R mutations, we analyzed clinical manifestations of 15 patients from 10 unrelated families and performed brain biopsy in 2 cases. Next generation sequencing was conducted for 10 probands to confirm the diagnosis. Sanger sequencing, segregation analysis and phenotypic reevaluation were utilized to substantiate findings. Functional examination of identified mutations was further explored.


Results
Clinical and neuroimaging characteristics were summarized. The average age at onset was 35.9 ± 6.4 years (range 24-46 years old). Younger age of onset was observed in female than male (34.2 vs. 39.2 years). The most common initial symptoms were speech dysfunction, cognitive decline and parkinsonian symptoms. One patient also had marked peripheral neuropathy. Brain biopsy of two cases showed typical pathological changes, including myelin loss, axonal spheroids, phosphorylated neurofilament and activated macrophages. Electron microscopy disclosed increased mitochondrial vacuolation and disorganized neurofilaments in ballooned axons. A total of 7 pathogenic variants (4 novel, 3 documented) were identified with autophosphorylation deficiency, among which c.2342C > T remained partial function of autophosphorylation. Western blotting disclosed the significantly lower level of c.2026C > T (p.R676*) than wild type. The level of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II), a classical marker of autophagy, was significantly lower in mutants expressed cells than wild type group by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining.


Conclusions
Our findings support the loss-of-function and haploinsufficiency hypothesis in pathogenesis. Autophagy abnormality may play a role in the disease. Repairing or promoting the phosphorylation level of mutant CSF1R may shed light on therapeutic targets in the future. However, whether peripheral polyneuropathy potentially belongs to CSF1R-related spectrum deserves further study with longer follow-up and more patients enrolled.

697,Inger Lauritzen,"Background
We recently demonstrated an endolysosomal accumulation of the β-secretase-derived APP C-terminal fragment (CTF) C99 in brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) mouse models. Moreover, we showed that the treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor (D6) led to further increased endolysosomal APP-CTF levels, but also revealed extracellular APP-CTF-associated immunostaining. We here hypothesized that this latter staining could reflect extracellular vesicle (EV)-associated APP-CTFs and aimed to characterize these γ-secretase inhibitor-induced APP-CTFs.


Methods
EVs were purified from cell media or mouse brains from vehicle- or D6-treated C99 or APPswedish expressing cells/mice and analyzed for APP-CTFs by immunoblot. Combined pharmacological, immunological and genetic approaches (presenilin invalidation and C99 dimerization mutants (GXXXG)) were used to characterize vesicle-containing APP-CTFs. Subcellular APP-CTF localization was determined by immunocytochemistry.


Results
Purified EVs from both AD cell or mouse models were enriched in APP-CTFs as compared to EVs from control cells/brains. Surprisingly, EVs from D6-treated cells not only displayed increased C99 and C99-derived C83 levels but also higher molecular weight (HMW) APP-CTF-immunoreactivities that were hardly detectable in whole cell extracts. Accordingly, the intracellular levels of HMW APP-CTFs were amplified by the exosomal inhibitor GW4869. By combined pharmacological, immunological and genetic approaches, we established that these HMW APP-CTFs correspond to oligomeric APP-CTFs composed of C99 and/or C83. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that monomers were localized mainly to the trans-Golgi network, whereas oligomers were confined to endosomes and lysosomes, thus providing an anatomical support for the selective recovery of HMW APP-CTFs in EVs. The D6-induced APP-CTF oligomerization and subcellular mislocalization was indeed due to γ-secretase blockade, since it similarly occurred in presenilin-deficient fibroblasts. Further, our data proposed that besides favoring APP-CTF oligomerization by preventing C99 proteolysis, γ-secretase inhibiton also led to a defective SorLA-mediated retrograde transport of HMW APP-CTFs from endosomal compartments to the TGN.


Conclusions
This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of oligomeric APP-CTFs in AD mouse models, the levels of which are selectively enriched in endolysosomal compartments including exosomes and amplified by γ-secretase inhibition. Future studies should evaluate the putative contribution of these exosome-associated APP-CTFs in AD onset, progression and spreading.",Anaïs Bécot;Alexandre Bourgeois;Raphaëlle Pardossi-Piquard;Maria-Grazia Biferi;Martine Barkats;Fréderic Checler
698,Jeroen Van Schependom,"Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex chronic inflammatory and degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Accelerated brain volume loss, or also termed atrophy, is currently emerging as a popular imaging marker of neurodegeneration in affected patients, but, unfortunately, can only be reliably interpreted at the time when irreversible tissue damage likely has already occurred. Timing of treatment decisions based on brain atrophy may therefore be viewed as suboptimal.


Main body
This Narrative Review focuses on alternative techniques with the potential of detecting neurodegenerative events in the brain of subjects with MS prior to the atrophic stage. First, metabolic and molecular imaging provide the opportunity to identify early subcellular changes associated with energy dysfunction, which is an assumed core mechanism of axonal degeneration in MS. Second, cerebral hypoperfusion has been observed throughout the entire clinical spectrum of the disorder but it remains an open question whether this serves as an alternative marker of reduced metabolic activity, or exists as an independent contributing process, mediated by endothelin-1 hyperexpression. Third, both metabolic and perfusion alterations may lead to repercussions at the level of network performance and structural connectivity, respectively assessable by functional and diffusion tensor imaging. Fourth and finally, elevated body fluid levels of neurofilaments are gaining interest as a biochemical mirror of axonal damage in a wide range of neurological conditions, with early rises in patients with MS appearing to be predictive of future brain atrophy.


Conclusions
Recent findings from the fields of advanced neuroradiology and neurochemistry provide the promising prospect of demonstrating degenerative brain pathology in patients with MS before atrophy has installed. Although the overall level of evidence on the presented topic is still preliminary, this Review may pave the way for further longitudinal and multimodal studies exploring the relationships between the abovementioned measures, possibly leading to novel insights in early disease mechanisms and therapeutic intervention strategies.",Kaat Guldolf;Marie Béatrice D'hooghe;Guy Nagels;Miguel D'haeseleer
699,David Czell,"Objective
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease with involvement of the upper and lower motor neurons. Since the loss of fine motor skills is one of the earliest signs of ALS, the hypothesis was tested if the nine hole PEG test (NHPT) and transcranial magnet stimulation (TMS) with resting-motor threshold (RMT) could be useful in monitoring disease progression.


Methods
We examined 28 ALS patients and 27 age-matched healthy controls. ALS patients and healthy controls underwent the nine hole peg test (NHPT) and TMS with RMT. Measurements in patients were repeated after three and six months.


Results
At baseline, the median NHPT durations were 1,4-fold longer (p < 0.001), and TMS scores showed a significant 0.8-fold smaller score in ALS patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). The comparison of three and six months versus baseline revealed significant differences for NHPT durations and ALSFRS-R in patients, whereas TMS scores did not significantly differ in the patients.


Conclusion
NHPT seems to be a good tool to evaluate dexterity of the hand and the progression of the disease in ALS patients. TMS RMT to the hand muscles seems to be poorly qualified to evaluate the dexterity of the hand function and the course of the disease.",Christoph Neuwirth;Markus Weber;Sabine Sartoretti-Schefer;Andreas Gutzeit;Carolin Reischauer

We collected reports on clinically-relevant sleep characteristics - time spent overnight in bed, sleep quality, excessive daytime somnolence and disruptive sleep events. Difficulty falling or staying asleep at night and excessive daytime somnolence were significantly more frequently reported for patients with both FTD and AD than healthy controls. On average, patients with FTD and AD retired earlier and patients with AD spent significantly longer in bed overnight than did healthy controls. Excessive daytime somnolence was significantly more frequent in the FTD group than the AD group; AD syndromic subgroups showed similar sleep symptom profiles while FTD subgroups showed more variable profiles.

701,Annapoorna Kannan,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by homozygous mutation or deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. A second copy, SMN2, is similar to SMN1 but produces ∼10% SMN protein because of a single-point mutation that causes splicing defects. Chronic low levels of SMN cause accumulation of co-transcriptional R-loops and DNA damage leading to genomic instability and neurodegeneration in SMA. Severity of SMA disease correlates inversely with SMN levels. SMN2 is a promising target to produce higher levels of SMN by enhancing its expression. Mechanisms that regulate expression of SMN genes are largely unknown. We report that zinc finger protein ZPR1 binds to RNA polymerase II, interacts in vivo with SMN locus and upregulates SMN2 expression in SMA mice and patient cells. Modulation of ZPR1 levels directly correlates and influences SMN2 expression levels in SMA patient cells. ZPR1 overexpression in vivo results in a systemic increase of SMN levels and rescues severe to moderate disease in SMA mice. ZPR1-dependent rescue improves growth and motor function and increases the lifespan of male and female SMA mice. ZPR1 reduces neurodegeneration in SMA mice and prevents degeneration of cultured primary spinal cord neurons derived from SMA mice. Further, we show that the low levels of ZPR1 associated with SMA pathogenesis cause accumulation of co-transcriptional RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) and DNA damage leading to genomic instability in SMA mice and patient cells. Complementation with ZPR1 elevates senataxin levels, reduces R-loop accumulation and rescues DNA damage in SMA mice, motor neurons and patient cells. In conclusion, ZPR1 is critical for preventing accumulation of co-transcriptional R-loops and DNA damage to avert genomic instability and neurodegeneration in SMA. ZPR1 enhances SMN2 expression and leads to SMN-dependent rescue of SMA. ZPR1 represents a protective modifier and a therapeutic target for developing a new method for the treatment of SMA.",Xiaoting Jiang;Lan He;Saif Ahmad;Laxman Gangwani

This technique allows for excellent decompression with clearance of the contralateral recess and foramen. In the video, we present the case of a 51-yr-old female patient with a past medical history of left L5-S1 microdiscectomy who presented in clinic with residual/recurrent foraminal disc herniation at L5-S1 compressing the left L5 nerve root. The patient had left lower extremity pain in the left hip and thigh that radiated down the front and side of the leg, as well as tingling and numbness in the left foot. The patient was treated via a L5-S1 microdiscectomy using a portable intraoperative computed tomography scanner, (Airo®, Brainlab AG, Feldkirchen, Germany), combined with 3-dimensional (3D) computer navigation. Patient consent was obtained prior to performing the procedure. The main advantage of this technique is the direct ""over-the-top"" trajectory to the foraminal pathology that minimizes the need of facet joint resection. The use of 3D navigation facilitates surgical planning and further minimizes facet joint compromise. Particularly, the inferior facet contralateral to the approach side as well as its outer capsular surroundings can be preserved.

703,Benjamin K Hendricks,"Dissecting aneurysms can pose an immense surgical challenge, and intervention often involves high risk for rerupture because of the volatile nature of the fibrin thrombus overlying the rupture site. This patient presented following rupture of a dissecting aneurysm along the A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA).

Manipulation of the aneurysm dome resulted in intraoperative rerupture of the aneurysm, which was controlled by the application of a temporary clip on the parent A2 proximally and distally. Aneurysmectomy of the thin diseased vessel wall was performed. The defect was filled by transecting the frontopolar branch of the ACA and sewing the frontopolar branch onto the aneurysmectomy defect.

704,Benjamin K Hendricks,"Large extramedullary-intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) within the spinal cord provide a unique management opportunity, compared with the cranial counterpart, in that the surgical morbidity can be minimized and surgical cure can still be achieved by resecting the extramedullary segment and leaving the intramedullary segment without invading the parenchyma. This management strategy minimizes morbidity and provides an excellent chance of surgical cure. This patient had a history of longstanding left hemiparesis since birth that progressed, prompting imaging evaluation that demonstrated a large cervical AVM with bilateral vertebral artery, anterior spinal artery, and left thyrocervical trunk feeding vessels. The AVM had both extramedullary and intramedullary components, making this a challenging lesion for microsurgical obliteration and preservation of neurological function. Preoperative embolization was utilized through the right vertebral artery pedicle. Microdissection was performed to isolate the extramedullary from the intramedullary component. Surgical cure was attempted for this patient by removing the extramedullary component and leaving the intramedullary segment.

705,Xiangyang Ma,"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE
Patients with severe thoracic or lumbar deformities can achieve satisfactory correction through appropriate osteotomies. However, patients with multiple craniocervical malformations commonly undergo conservative or finite surgical therapy mainly because of the involvement of the vertebral artery. Anterior oral meningocele is an extremely rare pathology that has not been previously reported. Here, we provide the first report of complex craniocervical anomalies combined with oral meningocele treated with a 1-stage anteroposterior atlantoaxial osteotomy correction surgery, with outcomes after 16 mo follow-up.


CLINICAL PRESENTATION
A 10-yr-old boy presented with recurrent dyspnea, cyanosis, and progressive torticollis. Imaging studies revealed complicated bony abnormalities accompanied by an anterior oral meningocele. A 1-stage extensive atlantoaxial osteotomy through anterior and posterior approaches was performed with an innovatively designed vertebral artery exclusion technique.

706,Avery L Buchholz,"Spinal deformity management can be difficult. The decision for surgery, approach, number of levels, and surgical technique all present challenges. Even when other issues are managed appropriately the process of how to correct the deformity needs special consideration. Numerous techniques have been studied including vertebra-to-rod, rod de-rotation, 3-rod-techniques, and cantilever maneuvers. While cantilever is the preferred technique when treating sagittal plane deformity, scoliosis often requires a combination of techniques due to the complexity of deformity in coronal and transverse planes. This video illustrates an adult scoliosis correction using sequential reduction towers and de-rotation techniques. Using this method the step of hook holders is eliminated and tension is distributed evenly across the rod using sequential reduction of the reduction towers across the length of the rod. This has led to a very efficient correction of our deformity as well as a powerful de-rotation tool. We routinely use this technique for flexible and rigid deformities, which is assessed pre-op with a computed tomography. The patient is a 67-yr-old female with prior lumbar decompressions and worsening back pain with radiculopathy. No significant sagittal malalignment is present but pelvic tilt is elevated and a coronal deformity exists. pelvic incidence measures 59°, LL50°, PT28° and lumbar scoliosis shows a coronal Cobb angle of 50.8°. Briefly, surgery involved transpedicular instrumentation from T10-S1 with bilateral iliac screw fixation. To achieve mobility posterior column osteotomies were performed at T12-L1, L1-2, L2-3, L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1 levels. TLIF was performed at L4-5, L5-S1 for fusion. Postoperative scoliosis X-rays demonstrated improved sagittal and coronal alignment with PI59°, LL59°, PT22°, and coronal Cobb angle of 12°.",Thomas J Buell;Mark E Shaffrey;Regis W Haid;Christopher I Shaffrey

Prior treatment with magnetic resonance-guided, laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) is widely assumed not to be a contraindication for further treatment of brain lesions, including further iterations of LITT. However, the safety and efficacy of repeat LITT treatments have never been formally investigated.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate treatment with multiple iterations of LITT.


METHODS
All patients treated with LITT at least twice at our institution were included in the study. Outcomes and neurological examinations from before and after surgery were retrospectively examined from clinic notes. Perilesonal edema was determined at various timepoints using volumetric data derived from manual tracings of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Finally, a literature review of prior cases of repeat LITT was performed.


RESULTS
A total of 9 patients underwent 18 treatments with LITT; all but 1 of whom were treated for metastatic brain lesions. One patient had a transient cerebrospinal fluid leak, whereas a second patient had a superficial wound infection, both of which resolved with standard medical care. The remaining 7 patients tolerated all LITT procedures without complication. Analysis of perilesional edema volume demonstrated a correlation with the amount of energy delivered during LITT. Literature review found 5 published papers describing 9 patients who underwent LITT more than once, the majority of whom tolerated repeat LITT well.


CONCLUSION
LITT is a safe and promising treatment modality and may be used multiple times without issue. There appears to be an association between the amount of energy delivered during a LITT session and the degree of postoperative perilesional edema.",Simon A Menaker;Walter J Jermakowicz;Ashish H Shah;Evan M Luther;Aria M Jamshidi;Alexa M Semonche;Long Di;Ricardo J Komotar;Michael E Ivan
708,Salomon Cohen-Cohen,"Endovascular therapy is the primary treatment for the majority of tentorial dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF). Surgical occlusion is an effective alternative when embolization is not possible. This video demonstrates microsugical occlusion of a right-sided tentorial dAVF in a symptomatic 45-yr-old male. The dAVF was fed directly by meningohypophyseal trunk. Venous drainage was retrograde through the sphenoparietal sinus, superficial sylvian vein, vein of Labee, and transverse sinus. The patient underwent a right-sided pterional craniotomy; the sylvian fissure was widely opened. Subarachoid dissection was performed until a large arterialized draining vein was identified exiting dura subtemporally. Intraoperative indocyanine green angiography confirmed the fistulous site and the draining vein was occluded and divided. The patient remained neurologically intact after surgery. Immediate angiography demonstrates complete occlusion of the dAVF. This video demonstrates the surgical access obtained through a transylvian approach for this tentorial dAVF. Occlusion of the draining vein, with or without resection of the fistula, is enough to permanently treat these lesions.",Michael J Link;Leonardo Rangel-Castilla

For optimizing high-grade glioma resection, 5-aminolevulinic acid is a reliable tool. However, its efficacy in low-grade glioma resection remains unclear.


OBJECTIVE
To study the role of 5-aminolevulinic acid in low-grade glioma resection and assess positive fluorescence rates and the effect on the extent of resection.


METHODS
A systematic review of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane was performed from the date of inception to February 1, 2019. Studies that correlated 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence with low-grade glioma in the setting of operative resection were selected. Studies with biopsy only were excluded. Positive fluorescence rates were calculated. The quality index of the selected papers was provided. No patient information was used, so Institutional Review Board approval and patient consent were not required.


RESULTS
A total of 12 articles met the selection criteria with 244 histologically confirmed low-grade glioma patients who underwent microsurgical resection. All patients received 20 mg/kg body weight of 5-aminolevulinic acid. Only 60 patients (n = 60/244; 24.5%) demonstrated visual intraoperative 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence. The extent of resection was reported in 4 studies; however, the data combined low- and high-grade tumors. Only 2 studies reported on tumor location. Only 3 studies reported on clinical outcomes. The Zeiss OPMI Pentero microscope was most commonly used across all studies. The average quality index was 14.58 (range: 10-17), which correlated with an overall good quality.


CONCLUSION
There is an overall low correlation between 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence and low-grade glioma. Advances in visualization technology and using standardized fluorescence quantification methods may further improve the visualization and reliability of 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence in low-grade glioma resection.",Tarek Y El Ahmadieh;Eva M Wu;Karl R Abi-Aad;Salah G Aoun;Aaron R Plitt;Najib E El Tecle;Toral Patel;Walter Stummer;Bernard R Bendok
710,William Clifton,"We present a surgical video highlighting the technical demonstration and microsurgical anatomy of an L4-5 transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion utilizing a combination of thermoplastic polymers and 3-dimensional printing technology to create a biomimetic lumbar spine surgical simulator. The posterior elements of L4-5 and the inferior portion of L3 are exposed in their entirety, including the transverse processes in order to identify the appropriate landmarks for pedicle screw insertion. The interspinous ligament of L4-5 is removed, and an interlaminar spreader is used to distract the facet joint. An inferior L4 facetectomy is performed for local autograft harvesting. The L4 and L5 pedicles are skeletonized to completely open the foramen in order to ensure that the exiting nerve root will not be compromised during cage insertion. The ligamentum flavum is then removed, exposing the common thecal sac and L5 traversing root. The L4 exiting nerve root is then identified, completing Kambin's triangle and location of the disc space. The disc is incised, and a combination of punches and curettes are used to completely remove the disc. After an interbody trial is used to assess the proper cage size, the cage is packed with graft and inserted into the midline of the disc space. Pedicle screws are then placed using an anatomic freehand technique, and intraoperative fluoroscopy is performed in order to evaluate the instrumentation and interbody position. If a contralateral decompression is required, a facet-sparing technique is performed in order to preserve bony surface for the fusion.

711,Jonathan Rychen,"BACKGROUND
The supraorbital craniotomy (SOC) is classically performed through a skin incision in the patient's eyebrow. A variant with a skin incision in the patient's eyelid has become increasingly popular in recent years.


OBJECTIVE
To compare the transpalpebral and the transciliary variants of the SOC with regard to their potential role in aneurysm surgery.


METHODS
We carried out cadaveric dissections and virtual craniotomies on computerized tomography datasets. The skin incision, the craniotomy location and size, the working angles, and the achievable exposure of neurovascular structures were assessed and compared for both variants of the SOC.


RESULTS
The skin incision measured 4 cm for the transpalpebral and 3 cm for the transciliary variant. The skin could be retracted 1.5 cm upward from the lower edge of the orbital rim with the transpalpebral and 2.5 cm upward with the transciliary variant. The craniotomy size was 2.5 × 1.5 cm for both variants, given that the transpalpebral variant included an orbital osteotomy. The bony opening in the transpalpebral variant was 1 cm more caudal; this restricted the craniocaudal working angles and, thereby, limited the achievable exposure of neurovascular structures in the paraclinoid area and along the sphenoid ridge.


CONCLUSION
If the orbital rim and the anterior aspect of the orbital roof are removed, then the transpalpebral variant of the SOC enables a bony opening that is just as large as that of the transciliary variant. Nonetheless, the more caudal location of the bony opening alters the available working angles and may impede exposure of key structures during aneurysm surgery.",Daniel W Zumofen;Howard A Riina;Luigi Mariani;Raphael Guzman
712,Joao Paulo Almeida,"Understanding of the microsurgical anatomy of the sella and suprasellar space is necessary for successful selection of surgical approaches and resection of craniopharyngiomas. Endoscopic endonasal surgery provides excellent exposure of the suprasellar space and has become the approach of choice for most of those tumors. In this video, we discuss the anatomical and surgical nuances for resection of craniopharyngiomas via an endoscopic transtuberculum transplanum approach. Anatomical dissections and a clinical case are used to illustrate the technique. This is the case of a 52-yr-old woman who presented to our clinic with a history of progressive visual decline and headaches, but no hormonal deficiencies. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the presence of a sella suprasellar solid cystic lesion suggestive of a craniopharyngioma. The lesion was mainly located anterior to the chiasm, preinfundibular and medial to the posterior-communicating artery. Considering the patient presented with no hormonal deficits, it was decided to proceed with an endoscopic extended approach for maximum tumor resection while attempting to preserve the pituitary stalk and gland and its function. The patient provided consent to undergo the procedure and for the surgical video. After a binostril approach and harvesting of vascularized flap, a large sphenoidotomy was performed, followed by a transtuberculum transplanum approach. The tumor was resected with blunt and sharp dissection with careful preservation of the branches of the superior hypophyseal and posterior-communicating arteries. Closure was performed in a multilayer fashion, with dura substitute, fascia lata, and vascularized flap. The patient had visual improvement after surgery and was discharged at postoperative day 5 with no complications. Anatomical dissection pictures © 2019 Joao Paulo Almeida, MD.

713,Michael R Jones,"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE
Chronic neuropathic facial pain is a debilitating disease that can be approached with multiple different treatment modalities. Cervical spinal cord stimulation has been demonstrated to be effective for patients suffering from neuropathic facial pain. Consensus does not exist in the literature regarding technique for placement.


CLINICAL PRESENTATION
A 49-yr-old female presented with chronic intractable neuropathic facial pain. She underwent a successful percutaneous spinal cord stimulation trial, followed by placement of a paddle electrode for permanent implantation. The paddle electrode failed to duplicate the pain relief of her trial. Measurement of the width of the paddle demonstrated that it was 2 mm smaller than the separation of the percutaneous trial electrodes. Electrodes with wider interelectrode distance were then placed with satisfactory pain relief.


CONCLUSION
Although conventional spinal cord stimulation targets the dorsal columns, cervical spinal cord stimulation for facial pain targets the spinal trigeminal nucleus. The effectiveness of stimulation may be increased with a more laterally positioned electrode in order to recruit the more laterally positioned spinal trigeminal nucleus. This case report illustrates the importance of this anatomic consideration.",Joshua M Rosenow

Computed tomography (CT) for minor head injury exposes a large number of children to ionizing radiation, with an associated increased lifetime risk of malignancy. To study imaging practices for children with minor head injury and the level of awareness of radiologists of the current clinical decision rules for minor traumatic brain injury (TBI).


METHODS
A questionnaire consisting of 17 questions was distributed electronically to 472 ESPR members. The questionnaire covered demographic information, employment status, years of experience and the current practice setting of the participants, the number of CTs performed for pediatric head trauma, awareness of clinical decision rules and use of shielding, pediatric CT protocol and MRI.


RESULTS
The response rate was 18.4%. The majority of participants was aged over 50 years and was full-time consultants. Regarding decision rules, 73.8% of respondents cited the NICE head injury guidelines, and 79% reported that the decision to perform CT was agreed between specialists. Shielding was used by 58.3% and 67.4% applied a specific pediatric protocol. MRI was not used for pediatric head trauma by 70.6% of respondents, although always available in 68.6% of cases. The reported obstacles to MRI use were machine availability (42.7%), the long acquisition time (39%) and patients' intolerance (18.3%), and less frequently the cost and the need for sedation.


CONCLUSION
There is room for decreasing the use of CT for pediatric minor TBI. The use of shielding and application of pediatric CT protocols constitute areas for improvement.",George A Alexiou;Vassileios G Xydis;Catherine Adamsbaum;Jean-Francois Chateil;Andrea Rossi;Nadine Girard;Élida Vázquez;Loukas G Astrakas
715,Daniel T Ginat,"PURPOSE
To analyze the implementation of deep learning software for the detection and worklist prioritization of acute intracranial hemorrhage on non-contrast head CT (NCCT) in various clinical settings at an academic medical center.


METHODS
Urgent NCCT scans were reviewed by the Aidoc (Tel Aviv, Israel) neural network software. All cases flagged by the software as positive for acute intracranial hemorrhage on the neuroradiology worklist were prospectively included in this assessment. The scans were classified regarding presence and type of hemorrhage, whether these were initial or follow-up scans, and patient visit location, including trauma/emergency, inpatient, and outpatient departments.


RESULTS
During the 2 months of enrollment, 373 NCCT scans were flagged by the Aidoc software for possible intracranial hemorrhage out of 2011 scans analyzed (18.5%). Among the flagged cases, 275 (72.4%) were positive; 290 (77.7%) were inpatient cases, 75 (20.1%) were trauma/emergency cases, and eight (2.1%) were outpatient cases, and 229 of 373 (62.5%) were follow-up cases, of which 219 (95.6%) inpatient cases. Among the 144 new cases flagged for hemorrhage, 66 (44.4%) were positive, of which 39 (58.2%) were trauma/emergency cases. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 88.7%, 94.2% and 73.7%, 97.7%, and 93.4%, respectively. The accuracy of the intracranial hemorrhage detection was significantly higher for emergency cases than for inpatient cases (96.5% versus 89.4%).


CONCLUSION
This study reveals that the performance of the deep learning software for acute intracranial hemorrhage detection varies depending upon the patient visit location. Furthermore, a substantial portion of flagged cases were follow-up exams, the majority of which were inpatient exams. These findings can help optimize the artificial intelligence-driven clincical workflow.",
716,Masumi Seki,"Central skull base osteomyelitis (CSBO) that has expanded to the middle cranial fossa is a rare complication of nasopharyngeal infection in children. Diagnosing CSBO is challenging in children, because specific symptoms are lacking and imaging findings can mimic skull base malignancy. We report on a 3-year-old girl who complained of pyrexia, headache, and vomiting and in whom a mass around the clivus was detected with magnetic resonance imaging. The patient received a diagnosis of CSBO based on characteristic imaging findings and the detection of a Streptococcus milleri group (SMG) in blood cultures. Clinical symptoms and abnormal imaging findings, including a mass lesion, were improved by prompt antibiotic treatment. The present patient had paranasal sinusitis with bacteremia of SMG, leading to the speculation of hematogeneous dissemination of SMG from the paranasal sinus. Awareness of CSBO, its early diagnosis, and aggressive management are required because CSBO is associated with high morbidity due to a life-threating infection involving multiple cranial nerves.",Masayoshi Yamaoka;Takaya Honda;Haruka Tokoro;Satoshi Matsushima;Masaharu Akiyama
717,Zhengmao Li,"Neurodegenerative diseases all share several common features such as involvement of oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in pathogenesis. Oxidative stress induced by overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) or impairment of the antioxidant deficiency results in mitochondrial dysfunction and initiation of the cell death cascade. Berberine (BBR), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to exert anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis effect in CNS diseases. However, the mechanism of BBR on regulating mitophagy and protecting mitochondrial function under oxidative stress remains unclear. In present study, we evaluated the beneficial effects of BBR on the tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we explored the protective role of BBR in mitochondrial function and mitophagy under oxidative stress in PC-12 cells. Our results demonstrated that BBR effectively inhibited t-BHP-induced apoptosis which is associated with the decreased leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ROS overproduction. Moreover, BBR significantly suppressed cytochrome c expression, upregulated the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction by optimizing mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨm) status and ATP production. In addition, BBR reduced the expression of autophagy-specific marker LC3, SQTM1/p62, and maintained lysosome normal function which involved the restoration of upstream signaling pathway AKT and mTOR phosphorylation level. Collectively, these findings suggested that BBR protects PC-12 cells from oxidative injury through inhibiting ROS level, mitochondria dysfunction, and mitophagy via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, which suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for oxidative stress and neurotoxic damages.",Ting Jiang;Qi Lu;Ke Xu;Jianping He;Lei Xie;Zaifeng Chen;Zhilong Zheng;Luxia Ye;Kebin Xu;Hongyu Zhang;Aiping Hu

To investigate the frequency and characterize the clinical features of treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis in an Austrian cohort.


METHODS
Patient charts of 126 patients with generalized myasthenia gravis and onset between 2000 and 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were classified as treatment-refractory according to strict, predefined criteria. These mandated patients being at least moderately symptomatic (i.e., MGFA class III) or needing either maintenance immunoglobulins or plasma exchange therapy for at least 1 year in spite of two adequately dosed immunosuppressive drugs. Clinical features and outcome at last follow-up were compared to treatment-responsive patients.


RESULTS
14 out of 126 patients (11.1%) met these criteria of treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis. Treatment-refractory patients had more frequent clinical exacerbations and more often received rescue treatments or a further escalation of immunosuppressive therapies. They also remained more severely affected at last follow-up. An early onset of myasthenia gravis was associated with a higher risk for a refractory course.


CONCLUSION
A small subgroup of patients with generalized myasthenia gravis do not respond sufficiently to standard therapies.

719,Stéphanie Machado,"BACKGROUND
Susac syndrome is a very rare cerebral small vessel disease, which can leave patients with cognitive impairment. We aimed at evaluating processing speed slowing, executive dysfunction and apathy and their relationships with whole brain and callosal atrophy.


METHODS
Patients with Susac syndrome included in a prospective observational cohort study were evaluated, while clinically steady-state, with standardized brain MRI and a neuropsychological battery specifically designed to capture minimal cognitive alterations in non-disabled young patients. Brain volume and corpus callosum area were measured using 3D-T1 sequences, repeatedly overtime. Relationships between neuropsychological data and brain volumetric measures obtained the same day were tested with linear regression while controlling for sex, age, level of education, scores of depression and of apathy.


RESULTS
Nineteen patients aged 37.5 ± 10.5 years were included. Mean follow-up time was 2.6 ± 1.3 years (5.8 ± 2.2 evaluations). While Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were 25.1 ± 3.6, processing speed slowing was obvious (Trail Making Test version A: 43.1 ± 16.2 s; version B: 95.5 ± 67.9 s; reaction time: 314.6 ± 79.6 ms). Brain and corpus callosum atrophy was striking. No relationship was found between cognitive performances and brain volume or corpus callosum area.


CONCLUSION
Patients with Susac syndrome show largely preserved global cognitive functions but important processing speed alterations. Although brain and corpus callosum area atrophy is prominent and evolving, we did not find any relationship with cognitive alterations, questioning the mechanisms underlying cognitive alterations in these patients.

720,Ladislava Vymetalova,"Neurodegenerative disorders present a broad group of neurological diseases and remain one of the greatest challenges and burdens to mankind. Maladies like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, stroke or spinal cord injury commonly features astroglia involvement (astrogliosis) with signs of inflammation. Regenerative, paracrine and immunomodulatory properties of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) could target the above components, thus opening new therapeutic possibilities for regenerative medicine. A special interest should be given to hMSCs derived from the umbilical cord (UC) tissue, due to their origin, properties and lack of ethical paradigms. The aim of this study was to establish standard operating and scale-up good manufacturing practice (GMP) protocols of UC-hMSCs isolation, characterization, expansion and comparison of cells' properties when harvested on T-flasks versus using a large-scale bioreactor system. Human UC-hMSCs, isolated by tissue explant culture technique from Wharton's jelly, were harvested after reaching 75% confluence and cultured using tissue culture flasks. Obtained UC-hMSCs prior/after the cryopreservation and after harvesting in a bioreactor, were fully characterized for ""mesenchymness"" immunomodulatory, tumorigenicity and genetic stability, senescence and cell-doubling properties, as well as gene expression features. Our study demonstrates an efficient and simple technique for large scale UC-hMSCs expansion. Harvesting of UC-hMSCs' using classic and large scale methods did not alter UC-hMSCs' senescence, genetic stability or in vitro tumorigenicity features. We observed comparable growth and immunomodulatory capacities of fresh, frozen and expanded UC-hMSCs. We found no difference in the ability to differentiate toward adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages between classic and large scale UC-hMSCs expansion methods. Both, methods enabled derivation of genetically stabile cells with typical mesenchymal features. Interestingly, we found significantly increased mRNA expression levels of neural growth factor (NGF) and downregulated insulin growth factor (IGF) in UC-hMSCs cultured in bioreactor, while IL4, IL6, IL8, TGFb and VEGF expression levels remained at the similar levels. A culturing of UC-hMSCs using a large-scale automated closed bioreactor expansion system under the GMP conditions does not alter basic ""mesenchymal"" features and quality of the cells. Our study has been designed to pave a road toward translation of basic research data known about human UC-MSCs for the future clinical testing in patients with neurological and immunocompromised disorders.

It has been established that BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is an important factor in ischemic injury. However, the exact mechanism of BDNF expression in the hippocampus after ischemia is unclear. We found that the decrease of BDNF protein expression in hippocampal CA1 was associated with a decrease of Bdnf transcript IV expression in the same region of the rats after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). In hippocampal CA3 and DG, the results showed increased expression of BDNF protein and transcripts I, IIc, III, IV, VI, and X1. Furthermore, at the Bdnf promoters, I/R led to decreased H3K27ac, increased H3K9ac, and H3K14ac in CA1; increased H3K9ac, H3K14ac, and H3K27ac in CA3; no significant change of H3K9ac, H3K14ac, and H3K27ac in DG.

UDS showed significant reduction in bladder capacity, improvement in bladder contractility in all groups and subgroups. Moreover, it showed improvement of urine flow rate only in Group B. Reduction of post-void residual urine was noted in all subgroups except in (Group A-II). I-QOL questionnaire showed improvement in patients with underactive bladder only. Intergroup comparison between A and B showed no difference.

723,Stefano Sotgiu,"Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS) is a progressive facial hemiatrophy often associated with severe epilepsy. Although an immune-mediated vasculitic pathogenesis is widely assumed, no CNS-specific autoantibody has been described so far. A 2-year-old boy was admitted for a status epilepticus preceded by fever, restlessness, insomnia, and left facial rash. Cerebrospinal fluid was positive for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-antibodies. Brain MRI revealed FLAIR hyperintensities on left mediotemporal areas. He was successfully treated with intravenous methylprednisolone. One month later, seizures and facial rash reappeared and steroids were satisfactorily repeated. However, left hemifacial rash reappeared 5 months later, slowly followed by sclerotic skin lesions on frontal scalp and hemifacial sub-atrophy, leading to a diagnosis of PRS. Three years later, and despite chronic immunosuppression, new MRI lesions on left white matter are seen and left hemifacial atrophy has progressed. For the first time, we describe GAD autoantibodies in a PRS patient with epileptic encephalopathy. Epileptic syndromes with GAD autoantibodies are frequently described though with a questionable pathogenic significance. Given the clinical and MRI similarities of PRS with both Morphea and Rasmussen's encephalitis, we suggest that, in our patient, the initial facial skin vasculitis spread into CNS vessels through perforating arteries, inducing neuronal MHC-class I presentation of GAD epitopes, ultimately causing CD8-mediated neuronal cytotoxicity and the epileptic encephalopathy.

Clinical trials suggest that prompt treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease (EPD) may slow down the disease progress and have a better response. Therefore, conducting proteomics study to identify biomarkers for the diagnosis and disease-modifying therapies of EPD is vital. We aimed at identifying distinct protein autoantibody biomarkers of EPD by using the database of GSE62283 based on the platform GPL13669 downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the EPD group (n = 103) and the normal control (NC) group (n = 111) were identified by protein-specific t test. Cluster analysis of DEPs was conducted by protein-protein interaction network to detect hub proteins. The hub proteins were then evaluated to determine the distinct biomarkers by principal component analysis, as well as functional and pathway enrichment analysis. Their biological functions were confirmed by gene ontology functional (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment (KEGG). Two biomarkers, mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor (MRRF) and ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18), distinguished the EPD samples from the NC samples, and they were regarded as high-confidence distinct protein autoantibody biomarkers of EPD. The most significant GO function was protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO: 0004674) and most of DEPs were enriched in ATP binding in molecular function category (GO: 0005524). These results may help in establishing the prompt and accurate diagnosis of EPD and may also contribute to develop mechanism-based treatments.",Qian Yao;Guo-Xin Jiang;Gang Wang;Qi Cheng
725,Jessica Leung,"OBJECTIVE
To describe incidence and clinical characteristics of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in the USA during 2009-2015, and characteristics of GBS cases with antecedent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection among persons with employer-sponsored insurance.


METHODS
We analyzed medical claims from IBM Watson MarketScan® databases. GBS patients were defined as enrollees with an inpatient claim with GBS as the principal diagnosis code, based on ICD-9 or ICD-10, and ≥ 1 claim for lumbar puncture or EMG/nerve conduction study. We assessed intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, intubation, dysautonomia, and death. We also assessed selected infectious illness within 60 days prior to the first GBS-coded inpatient claim.


RESULTS
We identified 3486 GBS patients; annual incidence was 1.0-1.2/100,000 persons during 2009-2015. GBS incidence was higher in males (1.2/100,000) than in females (0.9/100,000) (p = 0.006) and increased with age, from 0.4/100,000 in persons 0-17 years old to 2.1/100,000 in persons ≥ 65 years old (p < 0.001). Half of GBS patients were hospitalized in the ICU, 8% were intubated, 2% developed dysautonomia, and 1% died. Half had a claim for antecedent illness, but only 125 (3.5%) had a claim for specific infectious pathogens. The mean age among 18 GBS patients with antecedent CMV infection was 39 years versus 47 years among those without antecedent  CMV infection (p = 0.038).

726,Yating Jian,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The role of bilirubin in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is unknown. We investigated the relationship between admission bilirubin levels and hemorrhagic complication in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with MT and detailed the roles of direct bilirubin (DB), indirect bilirubin (IDB), and total bilirubin (TB).


METHODS
Consecutive AIS patients treated with MT were enrolled from two stroke centers. Outcome measures included hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 48 h. An independent association of bilirubin with outcomes was identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The accuracies of bilirubin in predicting outcome were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.


RESULTS
Of the 153 enrolled patients, 64 (41.8%) were diagnosed with HT, of which 28 (18.3%) had sICH. In univariate analyses, DB, IDB, and TB were higher in patients with HT and sICH than in patients without. After adjustment for potential confounders, DB (odds ratio [OR], 1.364; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.133-1.641; p = 0.001), IDB (OR, 1.143; 95% CI, 1.052-1.242; p = 0.002), and TB (OR, 1.106; 95% CI, 1.041-1.175; p = 0.001) were independently associated with HT. IDB (OR, 1.177; 95% CI, 1.064-1.303; p = 0.002) and TB (OR, 1.102; 95% CI, 1.027-1.182; p = 0.007) were independently associated with sICH. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed no significant difference between the three indicators of predicting HT and sICH.


CONCLUSIONS
Elevated admission bilirubin is an independent predictor of HT and sICH in AIS patients treated with MT.",Lili Zhao;Heying Wang;Tao Li;Lei Zhang;Man Sun;Meijuan Dang;Ye Li;Yiheng Zhang;Jiao Liu;Hong Sun;Huqing Wang;Ru Zhang;Yi Jia;Hongxing Zhang;Guilian Zhang
727,Arng Jack Chong,"BACKGROUND
A high-fat diet (HFD) is correlated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. The effect of HFD on neuroinflammation and apoptosis in acute stage after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats is not well known.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Five-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a HFD or normal diet (ND) for 8 weeks. Anesthetized male SD rats were divided into two subgroups: sham-operated and TBI. Motor function was measured using an inclined plane. The numbers of apoptotic neurons (markers Neu-N, TUNEL, caspase-3), activated astrocytes (marker GFAP) and microglia (marker OX42), and TNF-α expression in microglia and astrocytes in the ischemic cortex were investigated using an immunofluorescence assay. All of the parameters were measured on the 3rd day after TBI.


RESULTS
Rats fed a HFD for 8 weeks had higher body weight, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides. TBI-induced motor deficits, neuronal decrease, neuronal apoptosis, astrocyte and microglia activation, and TNF-α expression in microglia and astrocytes in the ischemia cortex were significantly increased in ND and HFD rats compared to sham rats. However, these parameters were not significantly different between the ND and HFD TBI groups, except motor deficit.


CONCLUSIONS
HFD has no significant effects on neuronal apoptosis or neuroinflammation in acute stage compared with ND for 8 weeks after moderate TBI in experimental rats.",Hsiao-Yue Wee;Chin-Hung Chang;Chung-Ching Chio;Jinn-Rung Kuo;Sher-Wei Lim
728,Roslynn E Stone,"The renin angiotensin system (RAS), which is classically known for blood pressure regulation, has functions beyond this. There are two axes of RAS that work to counterbalance each other and are active throughout the body, including the CNS. The pathological axis, consisting of angiotensin II (A1-8), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), is upregulated in many CNS diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease of the CNS characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal degeneration. Published research has described increased expression of AT1R and ACE in tissues from MS patients and in animal models of MS such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In contrast to the pathological axis, little is known about the protective axes of RAS in MS and EAE. In other neurological conditions the protective axis, which includes A1-7, ACE2, angiotensin II type 2 receptor and Mas receptor, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, regenerative and neuroprotective effects. Here we show, for the first time, changes in the protective arm of RAS in both EAE and MS CNS tissue. We observed a significant increase in expression of the protective arm during stages of disease stabilization in EAE, and in MS tissue showing evidence of remyelination. These data provide evidence that the protective arm of RAS, through both ligand and receptor expression, is associated with reductions in the pathological processes that occur in the earlier stages of MS and EAE, possibly slowing the neurodegenerative process and enhancing neural repair.

729,Monique B Nilsson,"Lung cancer results in more patient deaths each year than any other cancer type. Additional treatment strategies are needed to improve clinical responses to approved treatment modalities and prevent the emergence of resistant disease. Catecholamines including norepinephrine and epinephrine are elevated as a result of chronic stress and mediate their physiological effects through activation of adrenergic receptors on target tissues. Lung cancer cells express β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs), and numerous preclinical studies indicate that β2-AR signaling on lung cancer cells facilities cellular programs including proliferation, motility, apoptosis resistance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and the acquisition of an angiogenic and immunosuppressive phenotype. Here, we review the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting a potential role for beta-blockers in improving the clinical outcome of lung cancer patients.

730,Xu Wang,"Exosomes play an important role in cell-to-cell communication as they can transfer functional molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) from one cell to another, exerting biological and immunological functions. Here, we investigated the impact of HIV infection and/or heroin use on the expression of the miRNAs in plasma exosomes. We found that HIV infection or heroin use upregulated the majority (98%) of a panel of plasma exosomal miRNAs associated with immune regulation and inflammation. We also observed the enhanced effect of HIV infection and heroin use on some of these upregulated miRNAs. Our further investigation showed that the levels of four of neuro-inflammation-related miRNAs (146a, 126, 21, and let-7a) were higher in HIV-infected heroin users as compared with the control subjects. These findings indicate that the dysregulations of the plasma exosomal miRNAs support further studies to determine the role of the miRNAs in HIV and/or heroin use-mediated immune modulation and neuro-inflammation.

731,Domen Pregeljc,"We studied dopamine levels in three compartments of the dopaminergic synapse, including the presynaptic neuron cytosol, dopamine storage vesicles, and the synaptic gap. By considering three transport pathways (dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular transporter (VT), and exocytosis), four simulated scenarios were investigated: homeostasis, application of cocaine, methamphetamine, and reserpine. Recent experiments show that upon cocaine administration, the Drosophila melanogaster DAT permeation rate constant is decreased by 55% and we adopted this value for the human DAT. Amphetamine and methamphetamine block DAT and VT, while reserpine blocks VT; however, their decreased permeation rate constants are not available. A system of three differential equations of dopamine levels as a function of time was developed respectively for the synaptic compartments and was solved numerically. Per computational inference, the cytosol dopamine concentration was noted to increase in the case of methamphetamine and reserpine, but was practically unchanged in the case of the cocaine administration. Accordingly, our study suggests that amphetamines and other substances that block VT, but not cocaine or substances that only block DAT, may be etiologically important in the cytosolic dopamine mediation of neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease/Parkinsonism.",Diana Teodorescu-Perijoc;Robert Vianello;Nejc Umek;Janez Mavri
732,Neng-Yuan Hu,"Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system (CNS). They provide trophic support for neurons, modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity, and contribute to neuronal dysfunction. Many transgenic mouse lines have been generated to obtain astrocyte-specific expression of inducible Cre recombinase for functional studies; however, the expression patterns of inducible Cre recombinase in these lines have not been systematically characterized. We generated a new astrocyte-specific Aldh1l1-CreERT2 knock-in mouse line and compared the expression pattern of Cre recombinase between this and five widely-used transgenic lines (hGfap-CreERT2 from The Jackson Laboratory and The Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center, Glast-CreERT2, Cx30-CreERT2, and Fgfr3-iCreERT2) by crossing with Ai14 mice, which express tdTomato fluorescence following Cre-mediated recombination. In adult Aldh1l1-CreERT2:Ai14 transgenic mice, tdTomato was detected throughout the CNS, and five novel morphologically-defined types of astrocyte were described. Among the six evaluated lines, the specificity of Cre-mediated recombination was highest when driven by Aldh1l1 and lowest when driven by hGfap; in the latter mice, co-staining between tdTomato and NeuN was observed in the hippocampus and cortex. Notably, evident leakage was noted in Fgfr3-iCreERT2 mice, and the expression level of tdTomato was low in the thalamus when Cre recombinase expression was driven by Glast and in the capsular part of the central amygdaloid nucleus when driven by Cx30. Furthermore, tdTomato was clearly expressed in peripheral organs in four of the lines. Our results emphasize that the astrocyte-specific CreERT2 transgenic lines used in functional studies should be carefully selected.",Ya-Ting Chen;Qian Wang;Wei Jie;Yi-Si Liu;Qiang-Long You;Ze-Lin Li;Xiao-Wen Li;Sophie Reibel;Frank W Pfrieger;Jian-Ming Yang;Tian-Ming Gao
733,Vid Velikić,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive, persistent and unwanted thoughts and ritualistic, repetitive behaviors. The pathophysiology of OCD involves many distinct cortical and subcortical regions and it has been reported that OCD may occur as a consequence of traumatic brain injury, infections and tumors as well as cerebrovascular insult such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). We here describe the case of a 36-year-old woman who developed OCD at the age of 13 with almost complete remission of the symptoms after a 1 year-long treatment. Interestingly, after suffering CVST at the superior sagittal sinus at the age of 33, she experienced a relapse of OCD. The patient was successfully treated with Sertraline and Clomipramine. Previous studies revealed cases of OCD following different cerebrovascular accidents, i.e. predominantly arterial stroke. However, the present case is the first to describe OCD after venous thrombosis. Based on our clinical experience, the most effective treatment of OCD after CVST represents the combination of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Sertraline and the tricyclic antidepressant Clomipramine.",Andreas Wippel;Marion Freidl

735,Ramesh M Singa,"OBJECTIVE
Intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDS) are refilled using templates and palpation. The 2017 Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference recommends ultrasound only when reservoir ports are difficult to identify. The purpose of this study was to compare procedural outcomes and patient's preference for refill method of IDDS.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was approved by the Rush University IRB. Participants were randomized to have their IDDS with ultrasound or template using a 2:1 allocation. The time to reservoir port access, number of needle maneuvers/punctures, pain (NRS 0-10), complications, patient satisfaction, and patient refill modality preference, were recorded.


RESULTS
A total of 107 patients underwent 192 refills. There were 67 template-guided refills and 125 ultrasound-guided refills. No procedural pain (NRS = 0) was reported in 84% of the ultrasound-guided refills compared with 67% of the template-guided procedures, difference - 17% (95% difference - 3% to -31%, p = 0.01). When adjusted for age, gender, procedure duration, needle sticks, needle maneuvers and refills in the same patient, the odds ratio for a pain-free procedure with ultrasound-guidance was 3.1 (95% CI 1.3 to 7.2, p = 0.01). There was no difference between the groups in needle punctures (p = 0.87) or redirections (p = 0.34). Following 35/67 (52%) template-guided procedures, patients stated they preferred the ultrasound-guided but following only 12/125 (10%) of ultrasound-guided procedures, patients stated they preferred template-guidance (p < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Patients preferred ultrasound even though it lengthened the duration of refills compared to template-guided procedures. Fewer patients experienced procedural pain with ultrasound compared with template-guided refills. No safety issues were observed in either group.",Asokumar Buvanendran;Robert J McCarthy
736,Tej D Azad,"INTRODUCTION
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been critical in evaluating the safety and efficacy of functional neurosurgery interventions. Given this, we sought to systematically assess the quality of functional neurosurgery RCTs.


METHODS
We used a database of neurosurgical RCTs (trials published from 1961 to 2016) to identify studies of functional neurosurgical procedures (N = 48). We extracted data on the design and quality of these RCTs and quantified the quality of trials using Jadad scores. We categorized RCTs based on the device approval status at the time of the trial and tested the association of device approval status with trial design and quality parameters.


RESULTS
Of the 48 analyzed functional neurosurgery RCTs, the median trial size was 34.5 patients with a median age of 51. The most common indications were Parkinson's disease (N = 20), epilepsy (N = 10), obsessive-compulsive disorder (N = 4), and pain (N = 4). Most trials reported inclusion and exclusion criteria (95.8%), sample size per arm (97.9%), and baseline characteristics of the patients being studied (97.9%). However, reporting of allocation concealment (29.2%), randomization mode (66.7%), and power calculations (54.2%) were markedly less common. We observed that trial quality has improved over time (Spearman r, 0.49). We observed that trials studying devices with humanitarian device exemption (HDE) and experimental indications (EI) tended to be of higher quality than trials of FDA-approved devices (p = 0.011). A key distinguishing quality characteristic was the proportion of HDE and EI trials that were double-blinded, compared to trials of FDA-approved devices (HDE, 83.3%; EI, 69.2%; FDA-approved, 35.3%). Although more than one-third of functional neurosurgery RCTs reported funding from industry, no significant association was identified between funding source and trial quality or outcome.


CONCLUSION
The quality of RCTs in functional neurosurgery has improved over time but reporting of specific metrics such as power calculations and allocation concealment requires further improvement. Device approval status but not funding source was associated with trial quality.",Austin Y Feng;Swapnil Mehta;Alex B Bak;Eli Johnson;Vaishali Mittal;Rogelio Esparza;Anand Veeravagu;Casey H Halpern;Gerald A Grant
737,Michelle S Balaratnam,"OBJECTIVES
Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) pumps are an effective treatment for spasticity; however infection rates have been reported in 3-26% of patients in the literature. The multidisciplinary ITB service has been established at The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH, Queen Square, London for over 20 years. Our study was designed to clarify the rate of infection in our ITB patient cohort and secondly, to formulate and implement best practice guidelines and to determine prospectively, whether they effectively reduced infection rates.


METHODS
Clinical record review of all patients receiving ITB pre-intervention; January 2013-May 2015, and following practice changes; June 2016-June 2018.


RESULTS
Four of 118 patients receiving ITB during the first time period (3.4%, annual incidence rate of infection 1.4%) developed an ITB-related infection (three following ITB pump replacement surgery, one after initial implant). Infections were associated with 4.2% of ITB-related surgical procedures. Three of four pumps required explantation. Following change in practice (pre-operative chlorhexidine skin wash and intraoperative vancomycin wash of the fibrous pocket of the replacement site), only one of 160 ITB patients developed infection (pump not explanted) in the second time period (0.6%, annual incidence rate 0.3%). The infection rate related to ITB surgical procedures was 1.1%. In cases of ITB pump replacement, the infection rate was reduced to 3.3% from 17.6%.

This study suggests that a straightforward change in clinical practice may lower infection rates in patients undergoing ITB therapy.",Ann Donnelly;Honey Padilla;Sara Simeoni;Sardar Bahadur;Liz Keenan;Heesook Lee;Rachel Farrell;Carmel Curtis;Robert M Brownstone;Mary Murphy;Joan Grieve;Colin Shieff;Meenakshi Nayar;Robert D S Pitceathly;Gerry Christofi;Valerie L Stevenson
738,Catharina S de Jonge,"BACKGROUND
Continuously tagged MRI during free breathing can assess bowel motility at frequencies as low as the slow wave, motility pattern range. This study aimed to evaluate noninvasive gastrointestinal-tagged MRI for small bowel motility assessment and to observe the physiological response to a 300-kcal meal challenge in healthy, overnight-fasted volunteers.


METHODS
After overnight fasting, 16 healthy subjects (7 women, mean age 25.5, range 19-37 years) underwent a free breathing, tagged MRI scan to capture small bowel motility. Each subject underwent a (a) baseline motility scan, (b) food challenge, (c) postchallenge scan, and (d) second postchallenge scan (after 20 minutes). Motility was quantified using a frequency analysis technique for measuring the spectral power of the strain, referred to as motility score. Motility score was assessed in 20 frequency intervals between 1 and 20 contractions per minute (cpm), and the data were analyzed with linear mixed-effect models.


KEY RESULT
The stimulation protocol demonstrated an immediate, food-induced, motility response in the low-frequency range (2-10 cpm), which is consistent with the stomach and small bowel frequency range (3-12 cpm).


CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES
This study shows that this MRI tagging technique is able to quantify the fasted-to-fed response to a 300-kcal meal challenge within the specific small bowel motility frequency range in healthy subjects. The food provocation MRI protocol provides a tool to explore the gut's response to a stimulus in specific motility frequency ranges in patients with gastrointestinal dysmotility and functional disorders.",André M J Sprengers;Kyra L van Rijn;Aart J Nederveen;Jaap Stoker

Neuroinflammation is one of the most important processes in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Sensory disturbances are common in patients with PD, but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. This study aimed to characterize the activation of Schwann cells (SCs) and the increase of expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the sural nerve of PD, and further explore whether peripheral nerve inflammation is the cause of PD sensory disturbances.


METHODS
A total of 14 patients with PD (including 5 with sensory disturbances and 9 without sensory disturbances) and 6 controls were included. The excitation and conduction function of sural nerve was detected by sural nerve electrophysiological examination. With sural nerve biopsy samples, ultrastructural changes of sural nerve were observed by electron microscopy; Schwann cell biomarker glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were detected by immunohistochemistry, and the outcome of immunostaining slice was semiquantitatively counted; double immunofluorescence was used to identify the locus immunoreactive for inflammatory cytokines.


RESULTS
Compared with healthy controls, nerve conduction velocity (NCV) slowed down and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude decreased in PD patients, accompanied by axonal degeneration and demyelinating lesions, and expression of GFAP and inflammatory cytokines was increased. Inflammatory cytokines were significantly colocalized with GFAP and slightly colocalized with NF. These indicators did not differ significantly between PD patients with and without sensory disturbances.


CONCLUSION
Our study results suggest that peripheral sensory nerve injury exists in PD patients, accompanied by Schwann cell activation and inflammation, thus demonstrate peripheral nerve inflammation participates in the pathophysiological process of PD but it is not necessarily related to the patient's sensory disturbance.",Jing Wu;Fei-Fei Shen;Yong-Sheng Yuan;Xiao Li;Pan Ji;Lin Zhu;Li Sun;Jian Ding;Qi Niu;Ke-Zhong Zhang
740,Nigel H Greig,"AIM
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality of both young adults and the elderly, and is a key contributing factor in about 30% of all injury-associated deaths occurring within the United States of America. Albeit substantial impact has been made to improve our comprehension of the mechanisms that underpin the primary and secondary injury stages initiated by a TBI incident, this knowledge has yet to successfully translate into the development of an effective TBI pharmacological treatment. Developing consent suggests that a TBI can concomitantly trigger multiple TBI-linked cascades that then progress in parallel and, if correct, the multifactorial nature of TBI would make the discovery of a single effective mechanism-targeted drug unlikely.


DISCUSSION
We review recent data indicating that the small molecular weight drug (-)-phenserine tartrate (PhenT), originally developed for Alzheimer's disease (AD), effectively inhibits a broad range of mechanisms pertinent to mild (m) and moderate (mod)TBI, which in combination underpin the ensuing cognitive and motor impairments. In cellular and animal models at clinically translatable doses, PhenT mitigated mTBI- and modTBI-induced programmed neuronal cell death (PNCD), oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and effectively reversed injury-induced gene pathways leading to chronic neurodegeneration. In addition to proving efficacious in well-characterized animal TBI models, significantly mitigating cognitive and motor impairments, the drug also has demonstrated neuroprotective actions against ischemic stroke and the organophosphorus nerve agent and chemical weapon, soman.


CONCLUSION
In the light of its tolerability in AD clinical trials, PhenT is an agent that can be fast-tracked for evaluation in not only civilian TBI, but also as a potentially protective agent in battlefield conditions where TBI and chemical weapon exposure are increasingly jointly occurring.",Daniela Lecca;Shih-Chang Hsueh;Carlos Nogueras-Ortiz;Dimitrios Kapogiannis;David Tweedie;Elliot J Glotfelty;Robert E Becker;Yung-Hsiao Chiang;Barry J Hoffer
741,Megan M Niedzwiecki,"BACKGROUND
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder with contributions from genetic and environmental factors. High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) has the potential to identify novel endogenous and environmental factors involved in AD. Previous metabolomics studies have identified circulating metabolites linked to AD, but lack of replication and inconsistent diagnostic algorithms have hindered the generalizability of these findings. Here we applied HRM to identify plasma metabolic and environmental factors associated with AD in two study samples, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD incorporated to achieve high diagnostic accuracy.


METHODS
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based HRM was used to identify plasma and CSF metabolites associated with AD diagnosis and CSF AD biomarkers in two studies of prevalent AD (Study 1: 43 AD cases, 45 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] cases, 41 controls; Study 2: 50 AD cases, 18 controls). AD-associated metabolites were identified using a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) framework.


RESULTS
An MWAS meta-analysis identified three non-medication AD-associated metabolites in plasma, including elevated levels of glutamine and an unknown halogenated compound and lower levels of piperine, a dietary alkaloid. The non-medication metabolites were correlated with CSF AD biomarkers, and glutamine and the unknown halogenated compound were also detected in CSF. Furthermore, in Study 1, the unknown compound and piperine were altered in MCI patients in the same direction as AD dementia.


CONCLUSIONS
In plasma, AD was reproducibly associated with elevated levels of glutamine and a halogen-containing compound and reduced levels of piperine. These findings provide further evidence that exposures and behavior may modify AD risks.",Douglas I Walker;Jennifer Christina Howell;Kelly D Watts;Dean P Jones;Gary W Miller;William T Hu
742,Erik Smedler,"Background
The CACNA1C gene encodes the 1C subunit of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and has been associated with several psychiatric syndromes — including bipolar disorder — in several genome-wide association studies. Experimental and clinical studies have reported changes with respect to behaviour and biomarkers in risk allele carriers, corroborating the essential role of the CACNA1C gene in neurons, during development and in the mature brain. However, the association of this gene with regional cortical thickness has not been evaluated in patients with bipolar disorder.


Methods
Using magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the average cortical thickness of 68 brain regions in 87 patients genotyped for the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1006737 in CACNA1C.


Results
We found associations with the mean thickness of several cortical areas: the left lateral orbitofrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices, as well as other parts of the frontal and parietal cortices.


Limitations
This cross-sectional cohort study could not fully differentiate correlation from causation.

The CACNA1C polymorphism rs1006737 is associated with the mean thickness of cortical brain areas that have been shown to be altered in bipolar disorder.",Christoph Abé;Erik Pålsson;Martin Ingvar;Mikael Landén
743,Qilin Huang,"Objective: Gliosarcoma (GSC), a rare malignant brain tumor, is considered as a variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 wild type (IDH1-WT) glioblastoma (GBM). This study aimed to retrospectively analyze the clinical characteristics of GSC and compare whether there are some differences of treatment strategies and outcomes between GSC and GBM patients through Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.Patients and methods: The clinical data of adults diagnosed with primary GSC between 2004 and 2015 were queried from SEER database. The Kaplan-Meier curve and the Cox model were performed to analyze the relationships between clinical parameters and patients' prognosis. Similar analyses were conducted for all primary GBM patients of SEER.Results: In total, 527 GSC and 20,541 GBM patients with complete and valid clinical information were finally enrolled for further analysis. Compared with GBM, GSC owned a proclivity to temporal lobe rather than frontal lobe (p < 0.001), a less conservative extension of resection (EOR) (p < 0.001), and a higher sensitivity to radiotherapy (p < 0.001). As shown by univariate analysis, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy could prolong the overall survival (OS) time of GSC, but EOR did not confer an advantage to the outcomes of patients, no matter whether combined radio/chemotherapy was given. In multivariate analysis, age more than 60 and lack of radio/chemotherapy were identified as independent risk factors for OS of GSC patients.Conclusions: Our study found that although EOR seemed to be important to GBM, the extent of surgery did not show a clear relationship with the improved prognosis of GSC. Additionally, radiotherapy and chemotherapy could prolong patients' survival time significantly, which suggests a more positive role of them in treating GSC and needs further investigations.",Feng Li;Yihong Chen;Fan Hong;Hongxiang Wang;Juxiang Chen
744,Mahmoud Reza Ashrafi,"Introduction: Leukodystrophies constitute heterogenous group of rare heritable disorders primarily affecting the white matter of central nervous system. These conditions are often under-appreciated among physicians. The first clinical manifestations of leukodystrophies are often nonspecific and can occur in different ages from neonatal to late adulthood periods. The diagnosis is, therefore, challenging in most cases.Area covered: Herein, the authors discuss different aspects of leukodystrophies. The authors used MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GOOGLE SCHOLAR to provide an extensive update about epidemiology, classifications, pathology, clinical findings, diagnostic tools, and treatments of leukodystrophies. Comprehensive evaluation of clinical findings, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and genetic studies play the key roles in the early diagnosis of individuals with leukodystrophies.

New genetic methods and stem cell transplantation are also under investigation to further increase the quality and duration of life in affected population.Expert opinion: The improvements in molecular diagnostic tools allow us to identify the meticulous underlying etiology of leukodystrophies and result in higher diagnostic rates, new classifications of leukodystrophies based on genetic information, and replacement of symptomatic managements with more specific targeted therapies.Abbreviations: 4H: Hypomyelination, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypodontia; AAV: Adeno-associated virus; AD: autosomal dominant; AGS: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome; ALSP: Axonal spheroids and pigmented glia; APGBD: Adult polyglucosan body disease; AR: autosomal recessive; ASO: Antisense oligonucleotide therapy; AxD: Alexander disease; BAEP: Brainstem auditory evoked potentials; CAA: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; CADASIL: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; CARASAL: Cathepsin A-related arteriopathy with strokes and leukoencephalopathy; CARASIL: Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; CGH: Comparative genomic hybridization; ClC2: Chloride Ion Channel 2; CMTX: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, X-linked; CMV: Cytomegalovirus; CNS: central nervous system; CRISP/Cas9: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated 9; gRNA: Guide RNA; CTX: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid; DSB: Double strand breaks; DTI: Diffusion tensor imaging; FLAIR: Fluid attenuated inversion recovery; GAN: Giant axonal neuropathy; H-ABC: Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum; HBSL: Hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity; HCC: Hypomyelination with congenital cataracts; HEMS: Hypomyelination of early myelinated structures; HMG CoA: Hydroxy methylglutaryl CoA; HSCT: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant; iPSC: Induced pluripotent stem cells; KSS: Kearns-Sayre syndrome; L-2-HGA: L-2-hydroxy glutaric aciduria; LBSL: Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and elevated lactate; LCC: Leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts; LTBL: Leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate; MELAS: Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke; MERRF: Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers; MLC: Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts; MLD: metachromatic leukodystrophy; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; NCL: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; NGS: Next generation sequencing; ODDD: Oculodentodigital dysplasia; PCWH: Peripheral demyelinating neuropathy-central-dysmyelinating leukodystrophy-Waardenburg syndrome-Hirschprung disease; PMD: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease; PMDL: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease; RNA: Ribonucleic acid; TW: T-weighted; VWM: Vanishing white matter; WES: whole exome sequencing; WGS: whole genome sequencing; X-ALD: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; XLD: X-linked dominant; XLR: X-linked recessive.",Man Amanat;Masoud Garshasbi;Reyhaneh Kameli;Yalda Nilipour;Morteza Heidari;Zahra Rezaei;Ali Reza Tavasoli
745,Lisa V Graves,"Objective: Although cohort effects on IQ measures have been investigated extensively, studies exploring cohort differences on verbal memory tests, and the extent to which they are influenced by socioenvironmental changes across decades (e.g. educational attainment; ethnic makeup), have been limited.Method: We examined differences in performance between the normative samples of the CVLT-II from 1999 and the CVLT3 from 2016 to 2017 on the immediate- and delayed-recall trials, and we explored the degree to which verbal learning and memory skills might be influenced by the cohort year in which norms were collected versus demographic factors (e.g. education level).Results: Multivariate analysis of variance tests and follow-up univariate tests yielded evidence for a negative cohort effect (also referred to as negative Flynn effect) on performance, controlling for demographic factors (p = .001). In particular, findings revealed evidence of a negative Flynn effect on the attention/working memory and learning trials (Trial 1, Trial 2, Trial 3, Trials 1-5 Total, List B; ps < .007), with no significant cohort differences found on the delayed-recall trials. As expected, education level, age group, and ethnicity were significant predictors of CVLT performance (ps < .01). Importantly, however, there were no interactions between cohort year of norms collection and education level, age group, or ethnicity on performance.Conclusions: The clinical implications of the present findings for using word list learning and memory tests like the CVLT, and the potential role of socioenvironmental factors on the observed negative Flynn effect on the attention/working memory and learning trials, are discussed.",Lisa Drozdick;Troy Courville;Thomas J Farrer;Paul E Gilbert;Dean C Delis
746,Jonathan R Burgos,"BACKGROUND
The aim was to examine the impact of lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation on expression of mRNA for cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) and its ligands in CNS areas of relevance for feeding controls and metabolism. Lipopolysaccharide effects on plasma levels of TSH and CART peptides were also examined.


METHODS
Lipopolysaccharide (150-200 μg/mouse) was injected in C57BL/6J mice and tissue and plasma samples taken after 24 h. To establish if plasma increase in CART peptide levels were prostanoid dependent, indomethacin was given via the drinking water beginning 48 h prior to LPS. We evaluated mRNA expression for CART, TSHR, TSHβ, and thyrostimulin in brain and pituitary extracts. Plasma levels of TSH, CARTp, and serum amyloid P component were analyzed by ELISA.


RESULTS
Lipopolysaccharide suppressed TSHR mRNA expression in the arcuate nucleus and the pituitary. CART mRNA expression was reduced in the arcuate nucleus but elevated in the pituitary of mice treated with Lipopolysaccharide, whereas plasma TSH remained unchanged. Plasma CART peptide concentration increased after LPS treatment in a prostanoid-independent manner, and CART peptide levels correlated positively to degree of inflammation.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that central and peripheral CART is affected by acute inflammation. Considering the role of the arcuate nucleus in feeding controls, our data highlight TSHR and CART as putative neuroendocrine signaling components that respond to inflammation, perhaps to maintain weight and metabolic homeostasis during states of disease.",Britt-Marie Iresjö;Linda Olsson;Ulrika Smedh
747,Gladys Chompre,"BACKGROUND
HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) progression is related to continued inflammation despite undetectable viral loads and may be caused by early viral proteins expressed by latently infected cells. Astrocytes represent an HIV reservoir in the brain where the early viral neurotoxin negative factor (Nef) is produced. We previously demonstrated that astrocytic expression of Nef in the hippocampus of rats causes inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and memory impairment. Since these processes are affected by TGFβ signaling pathways, and TGFβ-1 is found at higher levels in the central nervous system of HIV-1+ individuals and is released by astrocytes, we hypothesized a role for TGFβ-1 in our model of Nef neurotoxicity.


METHODS
To test this hypothesis, we compared cytokine gene expression by cultured astrocytes expressing Nef or green fluorescent protein. To determine the role of Nef and a TGFβRI inhibitor on memory and learning, we infused astrocytes expressing Nef into the hippocampus of rats and then treated them daily with an oral dose of SD208 (10 mg/kg) or placebo for 7 days. During this time, locomotor activity was recorded in an open field and spatial learning tested in the novel location recognition paradigm. Postmortem tissue analyses of inflammatory and signaling molecules were conducted using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.


RESULTS
TGFβ-1 was induced in cultures expressing Nef at 24 h followed by CCL2 induction which was prevented by blocking TGFβRI with SD208 (competitive inhibitor). Interestingly, Nef seems to change the TGFβRI localization as suggested by the distribution of the immunoreactivity. Nef caused a deficit in spatial learning that was recovered upon co-administration of SD208. Brain tissue from Nef-treated rats given SD208 showed reduced CCL2, phospho-SMAD2, cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163), and GFAP immunoreactivity compared to the placebo group.


CONCLUSIONS
Consistent with our previous findings, rats treated with Nef showed deficits in spatial learning and memory in the novel location recognition task. In contrast, rats treated with Nef + SD208 showed better spatial learning suggesting that Nef disrupts memory formation in a TGFβ-1-dependent manner. The TGFβRI inhibitor further reduced the induction of inflammation by Nef which was concomitant with decreased TGFβ signaling. Our findings suggest that TGFβ-1 signaling is an intriguing target to reduce neuroHIV.",Neysha Martinez-Orengo;Myrella Cruz;James T Porter;Richard J Noel
748,Maria L Elkjaer,"To identify pathogenetic markers and potential drivers of different lesion types in the white matter (WM) of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS), we sequenced RNA from 73 different WM areas. Compared to 25 WM controls, 6713 out of 18,609 genes were significantly differentially expressed in MS tissues (FDR < 0.05). A computational systems medicine analysis was performed to describe the MS lesion endophenotypes. The cellular source of specific molecules was examined by RNAscope, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. To examine common lesion specific mechanisms, we performed de novo network enrichment based on shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and found TGFβ-R2 as a central hub. RNAscope revealed astrocytes as the cellular source of TGFβ-R2 in remyelinating lesions. Since lesion-specific unique DEGs were more common than shared signatures, we examined lesion-specific pathways and de novo networks enriched with unique DEGs. Such network analysis indicated classic inflammatory responses in active lesions; catabolic and heat shock protein responses in inactive lesions; neuronal/axonal specific processes in chronic active lesions. In remyelinating lesions, de novo analyses identified axonal transport responses and adaptive immune markers, which was also supported by the most heterogeneous immunoglobulin gene expression. The signature of the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) was more similar to control WM than to lesions: only 465 DEGs differentiated NAWM from controls, and 16 were unique. The upregulated marker CD26/DPP4 was expressed by microglia in the NAWM but by mononuclear cells in active lesions, which may indicate a special subset of microglia before the lesion develops, but also emphasizes that omics related to MS lesions should be interpreted in the context of different lesions types. While chronic active lesions were the most distinct from control WM based on the highest number of unique DEGs (n = 2213), remyelinating lesions had the highest gene expression levels, and the most different molecular map from chronic active lesions. This may suggest that these two lesion types represent two ends of the spectrum of lesion evolution in PMS. The profound changes in chronic active lesions, the predominance of synaptic/neural/axonal signatures coupled with minor inflammation may indicate end-stage irreversible molecular events responsible for this less treatable phase.",Tobias Frisch;Richard Reynolds;Tim Kacprowski;Mark Burton;Torben A Kruse;Mads Thomassen;Jan Baumbach;Zsolt Illes
749,Amit U Joshi,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 deficiency (ALDH2*2) causes facial flushing in response to alcohol consumption in approximately 560 million East Asians. Recent meta-analysis demonstrated the potential link between ALDH2*2 mutation and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Other studies have linked chronic alcohol consumption as a risk factor for AD. In the present study, we show that fibroblasts of an AD patient that also has an ALDH2*2 mutation or overexpression of ALDH2*2 in fibroblasts derived from AD patients harboring ApoE ε4 allele exhibited increased aldehydic load, oxidative stress, and increased mitochondrial dysfunction relative to healthy subjects and exposure to ethanol exacerbated these dysfunctions. In an in vivo model, daily exposure of WT mice to ethanol for 11 weeks resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and increased aldehyde levels in their brains and these pathologies were greater in ALDH2*2/*2 (homozygous) mice. Following chronic ethanol exposure, the levels of the AD-associated protein, amyloid-β, and neuroinflammation were higher in the brains of the ALDH2*2/*2 mice relative to WT. Cultured primary cortical neurons of ALDH2*2/*2 mice showed increased sensitivity to ethanol and there was a greater activation of their primary astrocytes relative to the responses of neurons or astrocytes from the WT mice. Importantly, an activator of ALDH2 and ALDH2*2, Alda-1, blunted the ethanol-induced increases in Aβ, and the neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that impairment in the metabolism of aldehydes, and specifically ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, is a contributor to AD associated pathology and highlights the likely risk of alcohol consumption in the general population and especially in East Asians that carry ALDH2*2 mutation.",Lauren D Van Wassenhove;Kelsey R Logas;Paras S Minhas;Katrin I Andreasson;Kenneth I Weinberg;Che-Hong Chen;Daria Mochly-Rosen
750,Thecla A van Wageningen,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological disability in young adults, pathologically characterized by leukocyte infiltration of the central nervous system, demyelination of the white and grey matter, and subsequent axonal loss. Microglia are proposed to play a role in MS lesion formation, however previous literature has not been able to distinguish infiltrated macrophages from microglia. Therefore, in this study we utilize the microglia-specific, homeostatic markers TMEM119 and P2RY12 to characterize their immunoreactivity in MS grey matter lesions in comparison to white matter lesions. Furthermore, we assessed the immunological status of the white and grey matter lesions, as well as the responsivity of human white and grey matter derived microglia to inflammatory mediators. We are the first to show that white and grey matter lesions in post-mortem human material differ in their immunoreactivity for the homeostatic microglia-specific markers TMEM119 and P2RY12. In particular, whereas immunoreactivity for TMEM119 and P2RY12 is decreased in the center of WMLs, immunoreactivity for both markers is not altered in GMLs. Based on data from post-mortem human microglia cultures, treated with IL-4 or IFNγ+LPS and on  counts of CD3+ or CD20+ lymphocytes in lesions, we show that downregulation of TMEM119 and P2RY12  immunoreactivity in MS lesions corresponds with the presence of lymphocytes and lymphocyte-derived cytokines within the parenchyma but not in  the meninges. Furthermore, the presence of TMEM119+ and partly P2RY12+ microglia in pre-active lesions as well as in  the rim of active white and grey matter lesions, in addition to TMEM119+ and P2RY12+ rod-like microglia in subpial grey matter lesions suggest that blocking the entrance of lymphocytes into the CNS of MS patients may not interfere with all possible effects of TMEM119+ and P2RY12+ microglia in both white and grey matter MS lesions.",Eva Vlaar;Gijs Kooij;Cornelis A M Jongenelen;Jeroen J G Geurts;Anne-Marie van Dam
751,Miranda J Francoeur,"The ability to choose between response alternatives based on their likely consequences depends on distributed neural circuits that involve rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To understand the effects of choice on mPFC function, we compared the activity of mPFC neurons in rats performing two tasks: dynamic delayed nonmatching to position (dDNMTP), a task with a prefrontal-dependent conditional choice, and serial lever pressing (SLP), a task lacking a choice but trained in the same apparatus with sequences of actions and reinforcements matched to dDNMTP. More neurons exhibited event-related responses during dDNMTP than SLP. Average firing rate during recording sessions was higher during dDNMTP for neurons with event-related responses, but lower for neurons with activity unrelated to behavioral events. Thus, compared to SLP, dDNMTP appears to enhance the activity of neurons that represent behaviorally-relevant information and to suppress the activity of neurons that do not. dDNMTP was associated with responses related to preparation and memory delay that were not observed during SLP as well as enhanced responses related to movement and reinforcement. These results provide evidence that choice in the dDNMTP task is associated with adaptive changes in background firing rates and coding properties of mPFC neurons.",Robert G Mair
752,Sara E Keefer,"Environmental cues can become predictors of food availability through Pavlovian conditioning. Two forebrain regions important in this associative learning are the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Recent work showed the BLA-mPFC pathway is activated when a cue reliably signals food, suggesting the BLA informs the mPFC of the cue's value. The current study tested this hypothesis by altering the value of 2 food cues using reversal learning and illness-induced devaluation paradigms. Rats that received unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the BLA and mPFC contralaterally placed, along with ipsilateral and sham controls, underwent discriminative conditioning, followed by reversal learning and then devaluation. All groups successfully discriminated between 2 auditory stimuli that were followed by food delivery (conditional stimulus [CS] +) or not rewarded (CS-), demonstrating this learning does not require BLA-mPFC communication. When the outcomes of the stimuli were reversed, the rats with disconnected BLA-mPFC (contralateral condition) showed increased responding to the CSs, especially to the rCS + (original CS-) during the first session, suggesting impaired cue memory recall and behavioral inhibition compared to the other groups. For devaluation, all groups successfully learned conditioned taste aversion; however, there was no evidence of cue devaluation or differences between groups. Interestingly, at the end of testing, the nondevalued contralateral group was still responding more to the original CS + (rCS-) compared to the devalued contralateral group. These results suggest a potential role for BLA-mPFC communication in guiding appropriate responding during periods of behavioral flexibility when the outcomes, and thus the values, of learned cues are altered.

753,B M Fisher,"Converging evidence in humans, monkeys, and rodents suggests a functional dissociation of cognitive function along the dorso-ventral axis of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Previous studies of attention suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a role in target detection, whereas the prelimbic (PL) cortex is important for tests requiring the combined detection and discrimination of signals. We investigated the effect of discrete, quinolinic acid-induced lesions of subregions of the rat medial PFC (mPFC)-ACC, PL cortex, and infralimbic (IL) cortex-on attentional performance on the recently developed rodent touchscreen continuous performance test (rCPT). Rats were tested under a range of behavioral conditions involving stimulus duration (SD), flanker distraction, temporal predictability, and event rate. Rats with lesions of the PL cortex demonstrated the most persistent attentional impairment under conditions of reduced and variable SD and high event rate (lower discrimination sensitivity [d'] and hit rate), and flanker distraction (lower hit rate). Rats with lesions of the ACC exhibited a profound but transient attentional impairment (lower d' and hit rate) in the early stages of behavioral testing, which ameliorated with repeated testing. Rats with lesions of the IL cortex showed no impairments on response control measures. The PL cortex plays a greater role than the ACC in the detection and discrimination of a complex visual stimulus among multiple nontarget stimuli in the rCPT. The findings support evidence for a functional dissociation of attentional performance along the dorso-ventral axis of the mPFC.

754,Laiss Bertola,"OBJECTIVES
Neuropsychological tests are often used in aging studies to compare distinct groups regarding diagnosis and prognosis. Because sociodemographic characteristics can influence cognitive scores, measurement of invariance is useful to assess the tests' ability to estimate the underlying constructs equally across groups and thus prevent biased interpretation. This study aims to verify measurement invariance in a large and socioculturally diverse sample.


METHOD
Middle-aged and older adults (N = 13,395) from the ELSA-Brasil study were evaluated regarding health status and cognition. Mean age was 51.5 ± 8.9 years, 54% were female, 52% were white, and 10% had lower education. Measurement invariance was analyzed using multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis for a two-factor model (memory and executive function). Configural, metric, and scalar invariance were tested across age, sex, race, and education groups.


RESULTS
The 2-factor model had a good fit to the entire dataset and for each group. Configural, metric, and scalar invariance confirmed that cognitive measures had the same structure and the items had similar relationships with the latent factors. Strict invariance was not achieved in most group comparison.


CONCLUSIONS
The 2-factor model was appropriate for estimating cognitive performance in participants without measurement error by age, sex, race, and education. These results suggest that differences in cognitive outcomes are likely to indicate true differences.

755,Karl-Josef Langen,"Introduction: Today, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard method for monitoring patients with brain tumors. The ability of conventional MRI in differentiating neoplastic tissue from non-specific, treatment-related changes after surgery, radio-, chemo- or immunotherapy, however, remains limited. Therefore, advanced MRI sequences and positron emission tomography (PET) are increasingly being considered to improve decision making.Areas covered: PET using radiolabeled amino acids has evolved into an important diagnostic tool to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional MRI. In view of the rapidly developing novel treatment strategies, a reliable statement on the response to therapy is becoming increasingly important. This article gives an overview of the current results of PET with radiolabelled amino acids in therapy monitoring of standard therapy as well as various innovative approaches in the treatment of patients with cerebral gliomas.Expert opinion: Amino acid PET has proven to be helpful in therapy monitoring of gliomas, the costs are low in relation to the costs of therapy and the clinical benefit, and a widespread clinical use is highly desirable.",Alexander Heinzel;Philipp Lohmann;Felix M Mottaghy;Norbert Galldiks
756,Agata Mulak,"Introduction: A growing body of evidence indicates that neuroendocrine interactions may occur at all levels of the brain-gut-microbiota axis, which is directly involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).Areas covered: The review presents some current and emerging concepts regarding the organization and functioning of the neuroendocrine system as well as the role of neuroendocrine disturbances in the pathophysiology and symptomatology of PD. The concept of the brain-gut-microbiota triad interactions in the neuroendocrine system and PD is proposed. In PD, dysregulation of the main neuroendocrine axes coordinated by the hypothalamus is accompanied by disruptions at the peripheral level, which involve enteroendocrine cells producing numerous neuropeptides. Moreover, the important role of the gut microbiota as a main coordinator of immune and neuroendocrine interactions is discussed. The potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications in the context of the recent developments in the fields of neuroendocrinology and neurodegeneration are also presented.Expert opinion: Unraveling complex neuroendocrine interactions in the course of PD may provide crucial diagnostic implications and novel therapeutic approaches including the application of gut neuropeptides and gut microbiota modification.",
757,Jennifer L Robinson,"There has been increasing interest in food- and dietary supplement-based materials that may support healthy cognition. However, few studies have quantitatively measured bioavailability, bioactivity, or cognitive short- and long-term effects of these materials against placebo. Earlier clinical studies reported ability of coffee cherry extract (CCE) to a.) reduce levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human blood and b.) to increase serum and exosomal levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neuroprotein essential for neurogenesis. Here, we examined CCE influence on cognitive performance. Seventy-one adults with mild cognitive decline completed this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 28-day regimen. Participants engaged in a cognitive challenge that involved working memory processes. Our results suggest that effects of CCE were notable during the first week and persisted throughout the study period. Specifically, participants on the CCE regimens had significant reductions in reaction time compared to placebo when comparing baseline to days 7 and 28 (p = 0.040, partial η = 0.130). A main effect of group was not identified for accuracy; however, strong trends were noted between the placebo group and two of the three CCE groups. These results suggest CCE, when taken in the morning or twice per day, is associated with improvements in reaction times and trends toward indications of improved accuracy.

758,Eun Joo Chung,"OBJECTIVE
The Korean patient with Perry syndrome (PS) was the first to come to autopsy. We report a pathologically confirmed patient with PS, and compare to pathological findings of previous literatures.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The patient had a family history of parkinsonism and had a mutation in the <i>DCTN1</i> gene. After death an autopsy was performed. We analyzed macroscopic and microscopic findings of the patient.


RESULTS
There was no prominent cortical atrophy, but microscopy showed severe neuronal loss, microvacuolation, and gliosis in the substantia nigra (SN). We identified transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, dystrophic neurites, and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in surviving SN neurons. In addition, some neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) were also seen in the parahippocampal gyrus.


CONCLUSION
The neuropathology, including TDP-43 proteinopathy, is comparable to that reported previously in Caucasian populations. In addition to the stereotypic features of PS, our patient had NFTs in the parahippocampal gyrus, the pathology similar to that is described as primary age-related tauopathy (PART). These observations suggest that comorbid age-related neuropathologic change may also contribute to cognitive impairment in PS. .",Sang Jin Kim;Eun-Joo Kim;Jae Woo Ahn;Gi Yeong Huh;Hwa Jin Cho;Nigel J Cairns
759,Karin Ludwig,"Spatial neglect is a debilitating neurological disorder marked by reduced exploration of contralesional space. We developed an intervention in which eye movements to and within one half of a search display were reduced over the course of several hundred trials. The aim of this study was to determine whether this intervention had an effect on the deployment of attention of healthy participants as a first step towards application in patients. The participants carried out a visual search task during which the stimuli in one half of the search display were removed whenever the participants made eye movements towards it. The stimuli in the other half were unaffected by eye movements. Indeed, this led to a steady relative decrease in fixations within the affected half over the course of the intervention. In five experiments, the performance in different spatial attention paradigms was measured before and after this intervention. In two visual search paradigms (feature and conjunction search), exploration of the affected half decreased compared to the unaffected half. In a Posner task with exogenous cues, a partial effect of the intervention was found. However, an attempt at replicating this effect was not successful. The fifth experiment showed that performance in a line bisection paradigm was not significantly influenced by the intervention. To conclude, the intervention showed the potential to influence the behavior of healthy participants in overt attentional exploration tasks.",Doris Schmid;Thomas Schenk
760,Joscha Böhnlein,"Although Exposure Therapy (ET) is the first-line treatment of Specific Phobia (SP), there is no clear consensus on which factors influence its success, and thus on how to conduct it most efficiently. This review summarizes the current state of research regarding this topic. N = 111 studies were in accordance with our eligibility criteria: participants had at least symptoms of SP, the intervention was ET and the study investigated a factor influencing its success. Best evidence for positive effects was found for low trait anxiety, high motivation and high self-efficacy before the ET, high cortisol levels and heart rate variation, evoking disgust additionally to anxiety, avoiding relaxation, focusing on cognitive changes, context variation, sleep, and memory-enhancing drugs. These factors may be conceptualized as modulating different aspects of learning as suggested in current models of ET that focus on inhibitory learning mechanisms. Limitations lie in the great heterogeneity concerning operationalization of factors and success. Based on these findings, we make suggestions for improvements in ET conduction and which factors should be researched in the future.",Luisa Altegoer;Nina Kristin Muck;Kati Roesmann;Ronny Redlich;Udo Dannlowski;Elisabeth J Leehr

762,Yun-Jin Chen,"Angiotensin II (ANGII) modulates expression of iron intake and export proteins in cultured neurons. However, the relevant mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of ANGII and/or candesartan, a ANGII-Type-1 Receptor (AT1R) antagonist, and PD123319, a ANGII-Type-2 Receptor (AT2R) antagonist on expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), ferroportin 1 (Fpn1)and ferritin as well as iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), hepcidin and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in Neuro-2a cells. We demonstrated that ANGII induces a significant reduction in expression of TfR1, Fpn1, IRP2 proteins and Nrf2 mRNA and an increase in ferritin protein and hepcidin mRNA, while candesartan, but not PD123319, significantly attenuated or reversed all these ANGII-induced changes in Neuro-2a cells.

Enhanced phosphorylation of ASK1 was detected during reactive gliosis both in vitro and in vivo, and P38 MAPK relayed the signal from phosphorylated ASK1 to the activation of astrocytes. Immunoprecipitation analyses suggested that 14-3-3 was dissociated from ASK1 during astrocyte activation.

764,Madelyne A Bisby,"Adolescence is characterised by substantial changes in emotion regulation and in particular, impaired extinction consolidation and retention. In this study, we replicated the well-established finding that increasing the activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) via the agonist WIN55212-2 improves fear extinction in adult rodents before examining whether this adjunct would also rescue the extinction retention deficit seen in adolescent rodents. Contrary to the effects in adults, we found that WIN55212-2 impaired within-session acquisition of extinction in adolescent rats with no effect on extinction retention. The same effects of WIN55212-2 were observed for juvenile rats, and did not vary as a function of drug dose. Increased fear expression observed during extinction training was not a result of altered locomotor or anxiety-like behaviour in adolescent rats, as assessed by the open field test. Lastly, we observed a linear decrease in CB1R protein expression across age (i.e., from juveniles, to adolescents, and adults) in both the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala, two regions implicated in fear expression and extinction, suggesting that there is continued refinement of the endocannabinoid system across development in two regions involved in extinction. Our findings suggest that the expression and extinction of fear in developing rats is differentially affected by CB1R agonism due to an immature endocannabinoid system.",Rick Richardson;Kathryn D Baker
765,Minghui Hua,"BACKGROUND
Numerous neuroimaging studies have revealed that schizophrenia was characterized by wide-spread dysconnection among brain regions during rest measured by functional connectivity (FC). In contrast with FC, effective connectivity (EC) provides information about directionality of brain connections and is thus valuable in mechanistic investigation of schizophrenic brain. However, a systematic characterization of whole-brain resting-state EC (rsEC) and how it captures different information compared with resting-state FC (rsFC) in schizophrenia are still lacking.


AIMS
To systematically characterize the abnormalities of rsEC, compared with rsFC, in schizophrenia, and to test its discriminative power as a neuroimaging marker for schizophrenia diagnosis.


METHOD
Whole-brain rsEC and rsFC networks were constructed using resting-state fMRI data and compared between 103 patients with schizophrenia and 110 healthy participants. Pattern classifications between patients and controls based on whole-brain rsEC and rsFC were further performed using multivariate pattern analysis.


RESULTS
We identified 17 rsEC significantly disrupted (mostly decreased) in patients, among which all were associated with the thalamus and 15 were from limbic areas (including hippocampus, parahippocampus and cingulate cortex) to the thalamus. In contrast, abnormal rsFC were widely distributed in the whole brain. The classification accuracies for distinguishing patients and controls using whole-brain rsEC and rsFC patterns were 78.6% and 82.7%, respectively, and was further improved to 84.5% when combining rsEC and rsFC.


CONCLUSIONS
Schizophrenia is featured by disrupted 'limbic areas-to-thalamus' rsEC, in contrast with diffusively altered rsFC. Moreover, both rsEC and rsFC contain valuable and complementary information which may be used as diagnostic markers for schizophrenia.",Yanmin Peng;Yuan Zhou;Wen Qin;Chunshui Yu;Meng Liang
766,Filippo Gagliardi,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor of adults and is characterized by extensive cell dissemination within the brain parenchyma and enhanced angiogenesis. Effective preclinical modeling of these key features suffers from several shortcomings. Aim of this study was to determine whether modulating the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) modifiers in proneural (PN) and mesenchymal (MES) cancer stem cells (CSCs) and in conventional glioma cell lines (GCLs) might improve tumor invasion and vascularization. To this end, we selected secreted, acidic and rich in cysteine-like 1 (SPARCL1) as a potential mediator of ECM remodeling in GBM. SPARCL1 transcript and protein expression was assessed in PN and MES CSCs as well as GCLs, in their xenografts and in patient-derived specimens by qPCR, WB and IHC. SPARCL1 expression was then enforced in both CSCs and GCLs by lentiviral-based transduction. The effect of SPARCL1 gain-of-function on microvascular proliferation, microglia activation and advanced imaging features was tested in intracranial xenografts by IHC and MRI and validated by chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays. SPARCL1 expression significantly enhanced the infiltrative and neoangiogenic features of PN and MES CSC/GCL-induced tumors, with the concomitant activation of inflammatory responses associated with the tumor microenvironment, thus resulting in experimental GBMs that reproduced both the parenchymal infiltration and the increased microvascular density, typical of GBM. Overall, these results indicate that SPARCL1 overexpression might be instrumental for the generation of CSC-derived preclinical models of GBM in which the main pathognomonic hallmarks of GBMs are retrievable, making them suitable for effective preclinical testing of therapeutics.",Ashwin Narayanan;Alberto Luigi Gallotti;Valentina Pieri;Stefania Mazzoleni;Manuela Cominelli;Sara Rezzola;Michela Corsini;Gianluca Brugnara;Luisa Altabella;Letterio Salvatore Politi;Marco Bacigaluppi;Andrea Falini;Antonella Castellano;Roberto Ronca;Pietro Luigi Poliani;Pietro Mortini;Rossella Galli
767,Marion Zanese,"BACKGROUND
Phosphorylation by protein kinases is a fundamental molecular process involved in the regulation of signaling activities in living organisms. Understanding this complex network of phosphorylation, especially phosphoproteins, is a necessary step for grasping the basis of cellular pathophysiology. Studying brain intracellular signaling is a particularly complex task due to the heterogeneous complex nature of the brain tissue, which consists of many embedded structures.


NEW METHOD
Overcoming this degree of complexity requires a technology with a high throughput and economical in the amount of biological material used, so that a large number of signaling pathways may be analyzed in a large number of samples. We have turned to Alpha (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay) technology.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD
Western blot is certainly the most commonly used method to measure the phosphorylation state of proteins. Even though Western blot is an accurate and reliable method for analyzing modifications of proteins, it is a time-consuming and large amounts of samples are required. Those two parameters are critical when the goal of the research is to comprehend multi-signaling proteic events so as to analyze several targets from small brain areas.


RESULT
Here we demonstrate that Alpha technology is particularly suitable for studying brain signaling pathways by allowing rapid, sensitive, reproducible and semi-quantitative detection of phosphoproteins from individual mouse brain tissue homogenates and from cell fractionation and synaptosomal preparations of mouse hippocampus.


CONCLUSION
Alpha technology represents a major experimental step forward in unraveling the brain phosphoprotein-related molecular mechanisms involved in brain-related disorders.",Giovanni Tomaselli;Valérie Roullot-Lacarrière;Maïté Moreau;Luigi Bellocchio;Agnès Grel;Giovanni Marsicano;Nathalie Sans;Monique Vallée;Jean-Michel Revest
768,Biao Cai,"BACKGROUND
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been implemented widely to study brain connectivity. In particular, time-varying connectivity analysis has emerged as an important measure to uncover essential knowledge within the network. On the other hand, independent component analysis (ICA) has served as a powerful tool to preprocess fMRI data before performing network analysis. Together, they may lead to novel findings.


METHODS
We propose a new framework (GICA-TVGL) that combines group ICA (GICA) with time-varying graphical LASSO (TVGL) to improve the power of analyzing functional connectivity (FNC) changes, which is then applied for neuro-developmental study. To investigate the performance of our proposed approach, we apply it to capture dynamic FNC using both the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) and the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) datasets.


RESULTS
Our results indicate that females and males in young adult group possess substantial difference related to visual network. In addition, some other consistent conclusions have been reached by using these two datasets. Furthermore, the GICA-TVGL model indicated that females had a higher probability to stay in a stable state. Males had a higher tendency to remain in a globally disconnected mode. Comparison with existing method: The performance of sliding window approach is largely affected by the window size selection. In addition, it also assumes temporal locality hypothesis.


CONCLUSION
Our proposed framework provides a feasible method to investigate brain dynamics and has the potential to become a widely used tool in neuroimaging studies.",Gemeng Zhang;Aiying Zhang;Wenxing Hu;Julia M Stephen;Tony W Wilson;Vince D Calhoun;Yu-Ping Wang
769,Danira Bažadona,"BACKGROUND
There is a need for highly sensitive and specific tests and biomarkers that would allow preclinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which would also enable timely intervention.


NEW METHOD
We have developed a new system (ALZENTIA) that helps detect early MCI, mainly caused by AD. The system is based on a hidden goal task (HGT) in which the human subject has to find a target that is not visible; as such, the navigation is based on a previously memorized target position, in relation to the starting position (egocentric variant) and/or other navigational landmarks (allocentric variant of the task). We present our preliminary results obtained in 33 patients with MCI and 91 healthy controls (HC).


RESULTS AND COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS
Between-group differences in the average error measured in allocentric, egocentric, and combined allocentric-egocentric subtests were statistically significant in MCI compared to HC. The high negative predictive values suggested high discriminative capacity and diagnostic potential for the HGT test as a tool to detect subjects in healthy population who will progress to MCI. Considering the low sensitivity of the Mini-Mental Status Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment tests, we believe that HGT can improve early identification of MCI patients who will progress to AD.


CONCLUSION
The HGT carried out with the ALZENTIA system proved to be a reliable screening test to identify individuals with MCI from an aging cohort.",Ivan Fabek;Mirjana Babić Leko;Mihaela Bobić Rasonja;Dubravka Kalinić;Ervina Bilić;Jakov Domagoj Raguž;Ninoslav Mimica;Fran Borovečki;Patrick R Hof;Goran Šimić
770,Andrey Chuhutin,"Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), is an imaging modality that yields novel disease biomarkers and in combination with nervous tissue modeling, provides access to microstructural parameters. Recently, DKI and subsequent estimation of microstructural model parameters has been used for assessment of tissue changes in neurodegenerative diseases and associated animal models. In this study, mouse spinal cords from the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis (MS) were investigated for the first time using DKI in combination with biophysical modeling to study the relationship between microstructural metrics and degree of animal dysfunction. Thirteen spinal cords were extracted from animals with varied grades of disability and scanned in a high-field MRI scanner along with five control specimen. Diffusion weighted data were acquired together with high resolution T2* images. Diffusion data were fit to estimate diffusion and kurtosis tensors and white matter modeling parameters, which were all used for subsequent statistical analysis using a linear mixed effects model. T2* images were used to delineate focal demyelination/inflammation. Our results reveal a strong relationship between disability and measured microstructural parameters in normal appearing white matter and gray matter. Relationships between disability and mean of the kurtosis tensor, radial kurtosis, radial diffusivity were similar to what has been found in other hypomyelinating MS models, and in patients. However, the changes in biophysical modeling parameters and in particular in extra-axonal axial diffusivity were clearly different from previous studies employing other animal models of MS. In conclusion, our data suggest that DKI and microstructural modeling can provide a unique contrast capable of detecting EAE-specific changes correlating with clinical disability.",Brian Hansen;Agnieszka Wlodarczyk;Trevor Owens;Noam Shemesh;Sune Nørhøj Jespersen
771,Erik D Fagerholm,"Models of coupled phase oscillators are used to describe a wide variety of phenomena in neuroimaging. These models typically rest on the premise that oscillator dynamics do not evolve beyond their respective limit cycles, and hence that interactions can be described purely in terms of phase differences. Whilst mathematically convenient, the restrictive nature of phase-only models can limit their explanatory power. We therefore propose a generalisation of dynamic causal modelling that incorporates both phase and amplitude. This allows for the separate quantifications of phase and amplitude contributions to the connectivity between neural regions. We show, using model-generated data and simulations of coupled pendula, that phase-amplitude models can describe strongly coupled systems more effectively than their phase-only counterparts. We relate our findings to four metrics commonly used in neuroimaging: the Kuramoto order parameter, cross-correlation, phase-lag index, and spectral entropy. We find that, with the exception of spectral entropy, the phase-amplitude model is able to capture all metrics more effectively than the phase-only model. We then demonstrate, using local field potential recordings in rodents and functional magnetic resonance imaging in macaque monkeys, that amplitudes in oscillator models play an important role in describing neural dynamics in anaesthetised brain states.",Rosalyn J Moran;Inês R Violante;Robert Leech;Karl J Friston

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for high cervical internal carotid artery stenosis is considered to be technically demanding because of the difficulty to dissect the distal end. We report the surgical technique and outcome analysis of CEA for high-cervical lesion.


METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed the records of 98 patients treated by CEA from December 2013 to June 2018. The plaque positions rostral to the C2 vertebral level was defined as the high-cervical lesions (n = 34).


SURGICAL TECHNIQUE
Successful expose the distal end included following elements: 1 Extending the skin incision. 2 Exposure of Great auricular nerve maximally. 3 Dissection between the SCM and Parotid gland fascia. 4 Resection of internal deep cervical lymph nodes. 5 Retraction of digastric muscle, hypoglossal nerve, and occipital artery RESULTS: There were 8 cases (High-cervical group: 4 cases, Non-high-cervical group: 4 cases) of postoperative DWI high signal and 6 cases (3 cases, 3 cases) of symptomatic ischemic lesion. 4 cases belonged to the technique related cerebral infarction (TRCI) group and 4 cases to the perioperative related cerebral infarction (PRCI) group. High-cervical lesion is not considered to be a risk factor for either PRCI (P = 0.610) or TRCI (P = 0.610). The difference of the diastolic blood pressure between the preoperative period and the 2nd postoperative day showed a risk factor of PRCI (P = 0.033).


CONCLUSION
The surgical outcomes for High-cervical lesions are equivalent to that of Non-high-cervical lesions. Excessive blood pressure management from the early postoperative days will be a risk of PRCI.",Nakao Ota;Felix Göhre;Yu Kinoshita;Kosumo Noda;Hiroyasu Kamiyama;Sadahisa Tokuda;Rokuya Tanikawa
773,Jinfeng Miao,"Malignant cerebral edema (MCE) is a life-threatening complication of acute cerebral stroke. To date, the focus has been on symptomatic treatment, rather than on prevention. Therefore, to identify high-risk patients and explore potential therapeutic approaches, we investigated the possible predictors of MCE. Specifically, we performed a meta-analysis to identify the potential predictors of MCE in patients with acute cerebral infarction. We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and VIP databases from their inception to July 2018 for cohort and case control studies on the predictors of MCE in patients with cerebral infarction. Forty-seven eligible studies containing a total of 45,826 patients were included. Our results suggest that the risk of MCE is higher in case of severe clinical symptoms and large infarct volumes. Additionally, male sex, older age, and a history of stroke and smoking were protective factors against MCE in cerebral infarction patients. Furthermore, thrombolytic therapy and recanalization substantially decreased the risk of MCE in patients with acute stroke. Higher admission temperature (in the subgroup with admission ≤12 h after onset), higher admission blood pressure, and admission leukocytes were also MCE predictors. Our findings facilitate the early prediction of MCE and may contribute to potential therapeutic approaches.",Xiaoyan Song;Wenzhe Sun;Xiuli Qiu;Yan Lan;Zhou Zhu

To investigate the correlation between fatty infiltration in the multifidus muscle related to the involved nerve root and structural parameters associated with stenosis in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Sixty-four patients with single-segment DLSS at L4-5 were retrospectively enrolled. The fatty infiltration rate (FIR) of the multifidus muscle at L5-S1, lumbar lordosis and the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the structural parameters at L4-5, such as dural sac, disc bulge, ligamentum flava and vertebral body of L5 were measured on magnetic resonance images using ImageJ software. All enrolled patients were divided into an FIR < 25 % group and an FIR ≥ 25 % group according to the FIR of the multifidus muscle at L5-S1. The propensity scores matching and adjustment of potential covariates were performed to reduce the confounding bias between the two groups.


RESULTS
Lumbar lordosis in the FIR ≥ 25 % group was significantly lower than that in the FIR＜25 % group in both cohorts. The mean differences in lumbar lordosis of 14.16 degrees between the two groups in the complete cohort and of 14.23 degrees in the matched cohort remained significant after adjustment. The disc bulge CSA/ vertebral body CSA in the FIR ≥ 25 % group was greater than that in the FIR＜25 % group in both cohorts. The mean differences in the disc bulge CSA/ vertebral body CSA between the two groups of 0.67 in the complete cohort and 0.96 in the matched cohort were statistically significant after adjustment. There was no significant difference in the dural sac CSA/ vertebral body CSA and ligamentum flava CSA/ vertebral body CSA between the two groups in either cohort regardless of adjustment. Logistic regression analysis for FIR ≥ 25 % in the multifidus muscle at L5-S1 exhibited that the disc bulge CSA/ vertebral body CSA were independent risk factors with odds ratio (OR) of 8.52, while lumbar lordosis were independent protective factors (OR = 0.72).

775,Mitsugu Yanagidaira,"The correlation between serum 50 % hemolytic complement (CH50) level and myasthenic symptom severity has not been known in patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR)-positive myasthenia gravis (MG) during eculizumab treatment. A patient with anti-AChR-positive MG showed severe bulbar symptoms. Eculizumab administration decreased CH50 level and improved the symptoms. However, shortly after the second administration of eculizumab was postponed due to the development of pneumonia, his serum CH50 level returned almost to the level it was at before the initiation of eculizumab therapy and myasthenic symptoms worsened. Even after his pneumonia was completely cleared in response to an antibiotic, the severe myasthenic symptoms persisted. After eculizumab was resumed, serum CH50 level was reduced to below the limit of detection within 24 h, and the symptom steadily improved. His symptom severity was correlated temporally with serum CH50 level during eculizumab therapy. Our case suggests that serum CH50 level may be a marker of eculizumab-induced complement blockade and an indicator of a potential worsening of myasthenic symptoms during eculizumab treatment.",Yoichiro Nishida;Takanori Yokota
776,Johannes Kohl,"Parenting is essential for survival and wellbeing in many species. Since it can be performed with little prior experience and entails considerable sacrifices without immediate benefits for the caregiver, this behavior is likely orchestrated by evolutionarily shaped, hard-wired neural circuits. At the same time, experience, environmental factors and internal state also make parenting highly malleable. These characteristics have made parenting an attractive paradigm for linking complex, naturalistic behavior to its underlying neural mechanisms. Recent work - based on the identification of critical neuronal populations and improved tools for dissecting neural circuits - has uncovered novel functional principles and challenged simplistic models of parenting control. A better understanding of the neural basis of parenting will provide crucial clues to how complex behaviors are organized at the level of cells, circuits and computations. Here I review recent progress, discuss emerging functional principles of parental circuits, and outline future opportunities and challenges.",
777,Heba Kandil,"Hypertension is a leading cause of mortality in the USA. While simple tools such as the sphygmomanometer are widely used to diagnose hypertension, they could not predict the disease before its onset. Clinical studies suggest that alterations in the structure of human brains' cerebrovasculature start to develop years before the onset of hypertension. In this research, we present a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the early detection of hypertension. The proposed CAD system analyzes magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) data of human brains to detect and track the cerebral vascular alterations and this is achieved using the following steps: i) MRA data are preprocessed to eliminate noise effects, correct the bias field effect, reduce the contrast inhomogeneity using the generalized Gauss-Markov random field (GGMRF) model, and normalize the MRA data, ii) the cerebral vascular tree of each MRA volume is segmented using a 3-D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), iii) cerebral features in terms of diameters and tortuosity of blood vessels are estimated and used to construct feature vectors, iv) feature vectors are then used to train and test various artificial neural networks to classify data into two classes; normal and hypertensive. A balanced data set of 66 subjects were used to test the CAD system. Experimental results reported a classification accuracy of 90.9% which supports the efficacy of the CAD system components to accurately model and discriminate between normal and hypertensive subjects. Clinicians would benefit from the proposed CAD system to detect and track cerebral vascular alterations over time for people with high potential of developing hypertension and to prepare appropriate treatment plans to mitigate adverse events.",Ahmed Soliman;Fatma Taher;Mohammed Ghazal;Ashraf Khalil;Guruprasad Giridharan;Robert Keynton;J Richard Jennings;Ayman El-Baz

Recently, the role of neural modulation in nonauditory cortices via repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for tinnitus control has been emphasized. It is now more compelling to consider these nonauditory cortices and the whole ""tinnitus network"" as targets for tinnitus treatment to achieve a better outcome.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to investigate the effects of active dual-site rTMS treatment in tinnitus reduction using a double-blind randomized controlled trial.


METHOD
In study 1, the dual-site rTMS treatment group (n = 17) was treated daily for 4 consecutive days. The sham group (n = 13) also visited the clinic for 4 days; they received sham treatment for the same duration as the dual-site rTMS treatment group. In study 2, the rTMS treatment protocol was exactly the same as in study 1. Magnetoencephalography recordings were performed before and 1 week after the last rTMS treatment. The outcome measure was the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score and the visual analog scale score. The effects of treatment were assessed 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after rTMS treatment in study 1. Then the mean band power and network changes were compared between pre- and post-treatment values after rTMS in study 2.


RESULT
Patients in the dual-site rTMS treatment group exhibited significantly improved THI scores at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after rTMS treatment compared with the pretreatment scores. However, the sham group did not show any significant reduction in THI scores. When the mean band power changes were compared between pre- and post-treatment assessments, an increased oscillation power was observed in the alpha band after rTMS.

780,Lai Gwen Chan,"OBJECTIVE
Sleep-wake disturbances, such as excessive daytime somnolence (EDS), are nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and significantly affect the quality of life. This study aimed to examine the relationship between EDS and motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD.


METHODS
Eighty-two patients with idiopathic mild PD were followed up twice a year for 2 years and assessed on sleep, mood, anxiety, cognition, function, and disease severity. Data were analyzed retrospectively, comparing motor and nonmotor outcomes between those with EDS and those without.


RESULTS
At baseline, 27.9% had EDS and were similar in demographic and clinical characteristics to those without; 10% had persistent EDS during the first year of follow-up. Excessive daytime somnolence had a significant main effect on mood and anxiety as shown by consistently higher scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale (P = .022) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale scores (P = .011) throughout duration of follow-up. The group with persistent EDS showed greater rate of worsening Frontal Assessment Battery scores by the end of first-year follow-up (P = .025) and greater rate of worsening Apathy Scale scores by the end of 2-year follow-up (P = .002). No significant effects of EDS on motor symptoms and disease severity were found.


CONCLUSIONS
In a Southeast Asian cohort of patients with PD, EDS had a negative longitudinal impact on mood, anxiety, apathy, and cognitive function but no impact on motor symptoms and disease severity. Excessive daytime somnolence is thus a potential therapeutic target to improve nonmotor outcomes.",Kimberly Sim Soon Siang;Ting Ting Yong;Russell Chander;Louis Tan;Nagaendran Kandiah
781,Michelle Kelly,"It is well established that people with a diagnosis of dementia can experience impaired social cognition. This study aimed to develop a new screening test for assessing social cognition impairments in dementia and to examine its convergent and construct validity in normal healthy adults and people with dementia. Materials from established tests with proven sensitivity to social cognition impairments were adapted to create a short screening test that uses pictures and simple text. The Brief Assessment of Social Skills-Dementia (BASS-D) is administrable bedside and examines emotion recognition, face identification, empathy, theory of mind, social disinhibition, social reasoning and memory for faces. The BASS-D was administered to 28 healthy older adults (M age = 76.71, SD = 6.15) and 26 participants with a diagnosis of dementia (M age = 81.38, SD = 9.39). Participants also completed a number of measures of social cognition and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III. Each of the BASS-D domains demonstrated adequate convergent validity (r = .32-.81), with the exception of Face Memory. Significant differences in total BASS-D total scores were observed between the healthy adults and participants with a diagnosis of dementia. BASS-D correlated with some measures of dementia but not others. In conclusion, the BASS-D holds promise as a short screen for assessing social skills in dementia that will assist families and carers in managing social cognition impairments. Further development of normative data in a larger set of healthy older adults along with evidence for test-retest reliability will advance this tool toward clinical utility.",Skye McDonald
782,Natasha L Wilkins,"Clinical methods for determining the severity of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and long-term functional outcome in the acute setting are limited in their prognostic accuracy due to the heterogeneity of injury and dynamic injury progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the timecourse and sensitivity of advanced MRI methods to neurological function after SCI in a rat contusion model. Rats received a graded contusion injury at T10 using a weight-drop apparatus. MRI consisted of morphological measures from T2-weighted imaging, quantitative T2-imaging, and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) at 1, 30, and 90 days post injury (dpi). The derived metrics were compared with neurological function assessed using weekly Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scoring, and return of reflexive micturition function. At the acute timepoint (1 dpi), diffusion metrics sensitive to axonal injury at the injury epicenter had the strongest correlation with time-matched BBB scores and best predicted 90 dpi BBB scores. At 30 dpi, axonal water fraction (AWF) derived from DWI and T2 values were both correlated with time-matched locomotor scores. At the chronic timepoint (90 dpi), cross sectional area (CSA) was most closely correlated to BBB. Overall, the results demonstrate differential sensitivity of MRI metrics at different timepoints after injury, but the metrics follow the expected pathology of acute axonal injury followed by continued degeneration and finally a terminal level of atrophy. The specificity of DWI in the acute setting may make it impactful as a prognostic tool while T2 imaging provided the most information about injury severity in chronic injury.",Nathan P Skinner;Alice Motovylyak;Brian D Schmit;Shekar N Kurpad;Matthew D Budde
783,Harald Krenzlin,"With increasing evidence for the existence of a cerebral thrombin system, coagulation factor IIa (thrombin) is suspected to influence the pathogenesis of secondary injury progression after Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We hypothesized that mechanisms associated with local volume expansion after ICH, rather than blood constituents, activate the cerebral thrombin system and are responsible for detrimental neurological outcome. To test this hypothesis, we examine the local thrombin expression after ICH in a C57BL/6N mouse model in the presence and absence of blood constituents. ICH was established, using stereotaxic orthotopic injection of utologous blood (n=10) or silicone oil as inert volume substance (n=10) into the striatum. Intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial blood pressure (MAP) were monitored during and 30min after the procedure. No significant differences between ICP, CBF, and MAP were found between both groups. Prothrombin mRNA expression was upregulated early after ICH. Immunohistochemistry showed an increase of perilesional thrombin in both groups (blood 4.24-fold, silicone 3.10-fold), while prothrombin fragment (F1.2) was elevated only in the absence of whole blood. Thrombin expression is co-localized with neuronal antigen expression (NeuN). After 24hrs, lesion size and neuronal loss were similar. Perihematomal thrombin correlated with increased neuronal loss and detrimental neurological outcome in-vivo. In our study, we demonstrate for the first time that the local cerebral thrombin system is activated after ICH and that this activation is independent of the presence of whole blood constituents. In our study, neuronal damage is driven by local thrombin expression and leads to an adverse clinical outcome.",Eva Gresser;Daniel Jussen;Nicole Riede;Louise Elisabeth Taylor;Christina Francisca Vogelaar;Florian Ringel;Oliver Kempski;Beat Alessandri
784,Claire Leconte,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a chronic pathology, inducing long term deficits that remains understudied in preclinical studies. In this context, exploration, anxiety-like behavior, cognitive flexibility and motor coordination were assessed until 5 and 10 months after an experimental TBI in the adult mouse, using two cohorts. In order to differentiate age, surgery, and remote gray and white matter lesions, three groups, unoperated, sham-operated, and TBI, were studied. TBI induced delayed motor coordination deficits at the pole test, 4.5 months after injury, that could be explained by gray and white matter damages in ipsilateral nigrostriatal structures (striatum, internal capsule) that were spreading to new structures between cohorts, at 5 versus 10 months after the injury. Furthermore, TBI induced an enhanced exploratory behavior during stressful situations (active phase during actimetry test, object exploration in an open field), risk-taking behaviors in the elevated plus maze 5 months after injury, and a cognitive inflexibility in the Barnes maze that persists until 9 months after the injury. These behavioral modifications could be related to the white and gray matter lesions observed in ipsi- and contra-lateral limbic structures (amygdala, hilus/CA4, hypothalamus, external capsule, corpus callosum, cingular cortex) that were spreading to new structures between cohorts, at 5 months versus 10 months after the injury.

785,Natalie V Covington,"Referring to things in the world - that woman, her idea, she - is a central component of language. Understanding reference requires the listener to keep track of the unfolding discourse history while integrating multiple sources of information to interpret the speech stream as it unfolds in time. Pronouns are a common way to establish reference. But due to their impoverished form, to understand them listeners must relate features of the pronoun (e.g., gender, animacy) with existing representations of potential discourse referents. Successful referential processing seems to place demands on memory. In a previous study, patients with hippocampal amnesia and healthy participants listened to short stories as their eye movements were monitored. When interpreting ambiguous pronouns, healthy participants demonstrated order-of-mention effects, whereby ambiguous pronouns are interpreted as referring to the first-mentioned referent in the story. By contrast, memory-impaired patients exhibited significant disruptions in their ability to use information about which character had been mentioned first to interpret pronouns. Repetition of the most salient information is a common clinical recommendation for improving pronoun resolution and communication in individuals with memory disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) but this recommendation lacks an evidentiary basis. The present study seeks to determine whether the pronoun resolution performance of hippocampal patients can be improved, by repetition of the target referent, increasing its salience. Results indicate that patients with hippocampal damage demonstrate improved processing of pronouns following repetition of the target referent, but benefit from this repetition to a significantly smaller degree compared to healthy participants. These results provide further evidence for the role of the hippocampal-dependent memory system in language processing and point to the need for empirically tested communication interventions.",Jake Kurczek;Melissa C Duff;Sarah Brown-Schmidt
786,Maxime Parent,"Targeting mitochondrial ion homeostasis using Kaempferol, a mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter channel activator, improves energy metabolism and behavior soon after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in developing rats. Due to broad TBI pathophysiology and brain mitochondrial heterogeneity, Kaempferol mediated early-stage behavioral and brain metabolic benefits may accrue from diverse sources within the brain. We hypothesized that Kaempferol influences TBI outcome by differentially impacting the neural, vascular and synaptic/axonal compartments. Following TBI at early development (P31), fMRI and DTI were applied to determine imaging outcomes at adolescence (2-months post-injury). Vehicle and Kaempferol treatments were made at 1, 24 and 48 hrs post-TBI and their effects were assessed at adolescence. A significant increase in neural connectivity was observed after Kaempferol treatment as assessed by the spatial extent and strength of the somatosensory cortical and hippocampal RSFC networks. However, no significant RSFC changes were observed in the thalamus. DTI measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), representing synaptic/axonal and microstructural integrity, showed significant improvements after Kaempferol treatment, with highest changes in the frontal and parietal cortices and hippocampus. Kaempferol treatment also increased corpus callosal FA, indicating measurable improvement in the inter-hemispheric structural connectivity. TBI prognosis was significantly altered at adolescence by early Kaempferol treatment, with improved neural connectivity, neurovascular coupling and parenchymal microstructure in select brain regions. However, Kaempferol failed to improve vasomotive function across the whole brain, as measured by cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR).

Spinal cord infarction (SCI) is rarely caused by vertebral artery dissection (VAD), which is an important cause of posterior circulation stroke in young and middle-aged patients. We report the case of a middle-aged patient without obvious risk factors for atherosclerosis who had SCI from right VAD.


CASE PRESENTATION
An otherwise healthy 40-year-old man presented with acute right-sided body weakness. Six days earlier, he had experienced posterior neck pain without obvious inducement. Neurologic examination revealed a right Brown-Séquard syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal. Further, cervical spine MRI showed spinal cord infarction (SCI) on the right at the C1-C3 level. Three-dimensional high-resolution MRI (3D HR-MRI) volumetric isotropic turbo spin echo acquisition (VISTA) scan showed evidence of vertebral artery dissection (VAD). The patient was significantly relieved of symptoms and demonstrated negative imaging findings after therapy with anticoagulation (AC) and antiplatelets (AP) for 3 months.


CONCLUSIONS
The possibility of vertebral artery dissection (VAD) should be considered in the case of young and middle-aged patients without obvious risk factors for atherosclerosis. Furthermore the VISTA black blood sequence plays an important role in the pathological diagnosis of vertebral artery stenosis. Early correct diagnosis and active therapy are crucial to the prognosis.",Le Dou;Chun-Mei Wang;De-Zheng Kong;Ying Wei;Li-Shan Wu;Yi Yang;Hong-Wei Zhou
788,Ya-Ni Zhang,"BACKGROUND
X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) is a rare inherited primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by the B cell developmental defect, caused by mutations in the gene coding for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which may cause serious recurrent infections. The diagnosis of XLA is sometimes challenging because a few number of patients have higher levels of serum immunoglobulins than expected. In this study, we reported an atypical case with recurrent meningitis, delayed diagnosis with XLA by genetic analysis at the second episode of meningitis at the age of 8 years.


CASE REPORT
An 8-year-old Chinese boy presented with fever, dizziness and recurrent vomiting for 3 days. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results were suggestive of bacterial meningoencephalitis, despite the negative gram staining and cultures of the CSF. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and responded well to the treatment. He had history of another episode of acute pneumococci meningitis 4 years before. The respective level of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) was 4.85 g/L, 0.93 g/L and 0.1 g/L at 1st episode, whereas 1.9 g/L, 0.27 g/L and 0 g/L at second episode. The B lymphocytes were 0.21 and 0.06% of peripheral blood lymphocytes at first and second episode respectively. Sequencing of the BTK coding regions showed that the patient had a point mutation in the intron 14, hemizyous c.1349 + 5G > A, while his mother had a heterozygous mutation. It was a splice site mutation predicted to lead to exon skipping and cause a truncated BTK protein.


CONCLUSION
Immunity function should be routinely checked in patients with severe intracranial bacterial infection. Absence of B cells even with normal level of serum immunoglobulin suggests the possibility of XLA, although this happens only in rare instances. Mutational analysis of BTK gene is crucial for accurate diagnosis to atypical patients with XLA.",Yuan-Yuan Gao;Si-Da Yang;Bin-Bin Cao;Ke-Lu Zheng;Ping Wei;Lian-Feng Chen;Wen-Xiong Chen
789,Yuanyuan Li,"BACKGROUND
The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) remain elusive, but recent opinions and perspectives have focused on whether the inflammation process induced by microglia contributes to α-synuclein-mediated toxicity. Migration of microglia to the substantia nigra (SN) could precede neurodegeneration in A53T mice. We hypothesized that CXCL12 could be a mediator in the α-synuclein-induced migration of microglia.


METHODS
After establishing appropriate animal and cell culture models, we explored the relationship between α-synuclein and CXCL12 in A53T mice, primary microglia, and BV-2 cell lines. We also explored the mechanisms of these interactions and the signaling processes involved in neuroinflammation.


RESULTS
We confirmed the positive correlation between α-synuclein and CXCL12 in the postmortem brain tissue of PD patients and the upregulated CXCR4 expression in SN microglia of A53T mice. In addition, as expected, α-synuclein increased the production of CXCL12 in microglia via TLR4/IκB-α/NF-κB signaling. Importantly, CXCL12/CXCR4/FAK/Src/Rac1 signaling was shown to be involved in α-synuclein-induced microglial accumulation.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study suggests that CXCL12 could be a novel target for the prevention of α-synuclein-triggered ongoing microglial responses. Blocking CXCL12/CXCR4 may be a potential therapeutic approach for PD progression.",Mengyue Niu;Aonan Zhao;Wenyan Kang;Zhichun Chen;Ningdi Luo;Liche Zhou;Xiongwei Zhu;Liming Lu;Jun Liu
790,Christy M Kelley,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI) seen in contact-sport athletes and military personnel. The medial temporal lobe (MTL; i.e., hippocampus, subiculum, and entorhinal and perirhinal cortices) memory circuit displays tau lesions during the pathological progression of CTE. We examined MTL tissue obtained from 40 male Caucasian and African American athletes who received a postmortem CTE neuropathological diagnosis defined as stage II, III, or IV. Sections were immunolabeled using an early (AT8) or a late (TauC3) marker for pathological tau and for amyloid beta (Aβ) species (6E10, Aβ1-42 and thioflavin S). Stereological analysis revealed that stage III had significantly less AT8-positive neurons and dystrophic neurites than stage IV in all MTL regions except hippocampal subfield CA3, whereas significantly more AT8-positive neurons, dystrophic neurites, and neurite clusters were found in the perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, hippocampal CA1, and subiculum of CTE stage III compared with stage II. TauC3-positive pathology was significantly higher in the perirhinal and subicular cortex of stage IV compared to stage III and the perirhinal cortex of stage III compared to stage II. AT8-positive neurite clusters were observed in stages III and IV, but virtually absent in stage II. When observed, Aβ pathology appeared as amyloid precursor protein (APP)/Aβ (6E10)-positive diffuse plaques independent of region. Thioflavine S labeling, did not reveal evidence for fibril or neuritic pathology associated with plaques, confirming a diffuse, non-cored plaque phenotype in CTE. Total number of AT8-positive profiles correlated with age at death, age at symptom onset, and time from retirement to death. There was no association between AT8-positive tau pathology and age sport began, years played, or retirement age, and no difference between CTE stage and the highest level of sport played. In summary, our findings demonstrate different tau profiles in the MTL across CTE stages, proffering CA3 tau pathology and MTL dystrophic neurite clusters as possible markers for the transition between early (II) and late (III/IV) stages, while highlighting CTE as a progressive noncommunicative tauopathy.",Sylvia E Perez;Elliott J Mufson

The neurosurgery residency match is becoming increasingly competitive, with numerous factors being considered as part of the application. We aim to determine whether USMLE Step 2 scores were a significant predictor of neurosurgery board performance.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Residents who entered a neurological surgery residency program at a single academic institution during 2000-2017 provided scores for all ABNS attempts, USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores. Data were deidentified and analyzed for correlation and regression. Pearson's correlation coefficients were determined.


RESULTS
USMLE Step 1, Step 2, and maximum ABNS scores were all normally distributed. Step 1 and Step 2 scores were less variable than ABNS scores. USMLE Step 2 and residents' best ABNS written examination scores were not correlated (Pearson Correlation of 0.228 with a 2-tailed significance of 0.272). No outliers were present. When comparing USMLE Step 2 scores with year in residency at which residents scored over 300 on the ABNS written examination, Pearson correlation was -0.500 (p = .015). A simple linear regression was calculated using Step 2 scores to predict the passing year of ABNS written examination (F(1,14) = 6.984, p = .015, R2 = 0.25).


CONCLUSION
Although other studies have found correlations between USMLE Step 2 scores and performance before graduating medical school and during residency for other specialties, this is the first study comparing USMLE Step 2 scores with the ABNS written examination scores of neurosurgical residents. Our data showed that USMLE Step 2 was not a reliable predictor of ABNS written examination scores.",Komal Preet;Carlito Lagman;Alexis M French;Colleen Bruton;Marvin Bergsneider;Lawrance Chung;Prasanth Romiyo;Luke Macyszyn;Isaac Yang
792,Fengmei Wei,"Cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) are part of the endocannabinoid system, which is involved in various physiological processes such as nociception, inflammation, appetite, stress, and emotion regulation. Many studies have linked the endocannabinoid system to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Hemopressin [Hp; a fragment of the hemoglobin α1 chain (95-103 amino acids)] and related peptides [VD-Hpα and RVD-Hpα] are peptides that bind to CBRs. Hp acts as an inverse agonist to CB1 receptor (CB1R), VD-Hpα acts as an agonist to CB1R, and RVD-Hpα acts as a negative allosteric modulator of CB1R and a positive allosteric modulator of CB2R. Because of the critical roles of CBRs in numerous physiological processes, it is appealing to use Hp and related peptides for therapeutic purposes.

793,Archana Mishra,"The sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions in schizophrenia are attributed to a decrease in nocturnal melatonin level which may worsen if treated with conventional sedative drugs. This study was planned to evaluate the effects of add-on ramelteon on sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances in schizophrenia.

Patients were categorized into predominantly positive (PG) or negative (NG) symptoms depending on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scoring, and then they were randomized into control (haloperidol/risperidone) or test (add-on ramelteon) groups. After recruitment, baseline serum melatonin, serum AANAT, urinary melatonin and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were evaluated. Patients were reassessed after 4 weeks of therapy with antipsychotics with or without ramelteon.

794,Mariam Bonyadi Camacho,"Second-line depression treatment involves augmentation with one (rarely two) additional drugs, of chronic administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is the first-line depression treatment. Unfortunately, many depressed patients still fail to respond even after months to years of searching to find an effective combination. To aid in the identification of potentially effective antidepressant combinations, we created a computational model of the monoaminergic neurotransmitter (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), stress-hormone (cortisol), and male sex hormone (testosterone) systems. The model was trained via machine learning to represent a broad range of empirical observations. Neuroadaptation to chronic drug administration was simulated through incremental adjustments in model parameters that corresponded to key regulatory components of the neurotransmitter and neurohormone systems. Analysis revealed that neuroadaptation in the model depended on all of the regulatory components in complicated ways, and did not reveal any one or a few specific components that could be targeted in the design of antidepressant treatments. We used large sets of neuroadapted states of the model to screen 74 different drug and hormone combinations and identified several combinations that could potentially be therapeutic for a higher proportion of male patients than SSRIs by themselves.",Warut D Vijitbenjaronk;Thomas J Anastasio

796,M Irene Renaud,"OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to identify predictors of long-term consequences for activities and participation in children and adolescents with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).


METHODS
A multicentre prospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted. The primary outcome measure was activities and participation measured with the Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation - CASP and completed by children (N = 156) and caregivers (N = 231) six months post-mTBI. The CASP items were categorized into home, community, school, and environment. Predictors were categorized according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth. Predictors included pre-injury personal- and environmental factors, injury-related factors, symptoms, and resumption of activities in the first two weeks after mTBI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the predictive value of these factors.


RESULTS
Results show that predictors differ across settings and perspectives (child or caregiver). Decreased activities and participation in children with mTBI can be predicted by adverse pre-injury behavioral functioning of the child (p < .000 - p = .038), adverse pre-injury family functioning (p = .001), lower parental SES (p = .038), more stress symptoms post-injury (p = .017 - p = .032), more post-concussive symptoms (p = .016 - p = .028) and less resumption of activities (p = .006 - p = .045).


DISCUSSION
Pre-injury factors, more symptoms post-injury and less resumption of activities should be considered when children are screened for unfavorable outcomes. Additional factors may add to the prediction, but injury-related factors do not. It is recommended that future research explores psychosocial factors, such as coping styles, emotion-regulation, personality traits, social support, and other comorbid problems of both children and caregivers.",Suzanne A M Lambregts;Ingrid G L van de Port;Coriene E Catsman-Berrevoets;Caroline M van Heugten
797,Michelle C D Bridi,"A balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) maintained within a narrow window is widely regarded to be crucial for cortical processing. In line with this idea, the E/I balance is reportedly comparable across neighboring neurons, behavioral states, and developmental stages and altered in many neurological disorders. Motivated by these ideas, we examined whether synaptic inhibition changes over the 24-h day to compensate for the well-documented sleep-dependent changes in synaptic excitation. We found that, in pyramidal cells of visual and prefrontal cortices and hippocampal CA1, synaptic inhibition also changes over the 24-h light/dark cycle but, surprisingly, in the opposite direction of synaptic excitation. Inhibition is upregulated in the visual cortex during the light phase in a sleep-dependent manner. In the visual cortex, these changes in the E/I balance occurred in feedback, but not feedforward, circuits.

799,Xinfeng Liu,"BACKGROUND
Previous randomised trials have shown an overwhelming benefit of mechanical thrombectomy for treating patients with stroke caused by large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation. Whether endovascular treatment is beneficial for vertebrobasilar artery occlusion remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment of acute strokes due to vertebrobasilar artery occlusion.


METHODS
We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label trial, with blinded outcome assessment of thrombectomy in patients presenting within 8 h of vertebrobasilar occlusion at 28 centres in China. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to endovascular therapy plus standard medical therapy (intervention group) or standard medical therapy alone (control group). The randomisation sequence was computer-generated and stratified by participating centres. Allocation concealment was implemented by use of sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 3 or lower (indicating ability to walk unassisted) at 90 days, assessed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary safety outcome was mortality at 90 days. Secondary safety endpoints included the rates of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, device-related complications, and other severe adverse events. The BEST trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02441556.


FINDINGS
Between April 27, 2015, and Sept 27, 2017, we assessed 288 patients for eligibility. The trial was terminated early after 131 patients had been randomly assigned (66 patients to the intervention group and 65 to the control group) because of high crossover rate and poor recruitment. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of participants with mRS 0-3 at 90 days according to treatment (28 [42%] of 66 patients in the intervention group vs 21 [32%] of 65 in the control group; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·74, 95% CI 0·81-3·74). Secondary prespecified analyses of the primary outcome, done to assess the effect of crossovers, showed higher rates of mRS 0-3 at 90 days in patients who actually received the intervention compared with those who received standard medical therapy alone in both per-protocol (28 [44%] of 63 patients with intervention vs 13 [25%] of 51 with standard therapy; adjusted OR 2·90, 95% CI 1·20-7·03) and as-treated (36 [47%] of 77 patients with intervention vs 13 [24%] of 54 with standard therapy; 3·02, 1·31-7·00) populations. The 90-day mortality was similar between groups (22 [33%] of 66 patients in the intervention vs 25 [38%] of 65 in the control group; p=0·54) despite a numerically higher prevalence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in the intervention group.


INTERPRETATION
There was no evidence of a difference in favourable outcomes of patients receiving endovascular therapy compared with those receiving standard medical therapy alone. Results might have been confounded by loss of equipoise over the course of the trial, resulting in poor adherence to the assigned study treatment and a reduced sample size due to the early termination of the study.

The effect of white matter hyperintensities as measured by FLAIR MR imaging on functional impairment and recovery after ischemic stroke has been investigated thoroughly. However, there has been growing interest in investigating normal-appearing white matter microstructural integrity following ischemic stroke onset with techniques such as DTI.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fifty-two patients with acute ischemic stroke and 36 without stroke were evaluated with a DTI and FLAIR imaging protocol and clinically assessed for the severity of motor impairment using the Motricity Index within 72 hours of suspected symptom onset.


RESULTS
There were widespread decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity for the acute stroke group compared with the nonstroke group. There was a significant positive association between fractional anisotropy and motor function and a significant negative association between mean diffusivity/radial diffusivity and motor function. The normal-appearing white matter ROIs that were most sensitive to the Motricity Index were the anterior/posterior limb of the internal capsule in the infarcted hemisphere and the splenium of the corpus callosum, external capsule, posterior limb/retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and cingulum (hippocampus) of the intrahemisphere/contralateral hemisphere.

802,S B Strauss,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Differentiation between tuberculous and pyogenic spondylodiscitis is a diagnostic challenge because imaging often does not reliably distinguish the 2 entities and percutaneous biopsies are often culture-negative. The purpose of this study was to determine whether violation of the anterior meningovertebral ligament in the setting of anterior epidural abscess discriminates between these entities.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients with acid-fast bacillus testing and anterior epidural abscess diagnosed on spinal MR imaging between May 2014 and September 2019, with a final diagnosis of tuberculous or pyogenic spondylodiscitis. Six cases of tuberculous spondylodiscitis (mean age, 45.5 years; 80% male) and 35 cases of pyogenic spondylodiscitis were evaluated (mean age, 56.6 years; 49% male). Demographic characteristics were recorded. Cases were assessed for anterior meningovertebral ligament destruction on MR imaging, as demonstrated by the shape of the epidural collection. Segmental location of the infection was also assessed. Independent 2-sample t tests and χ2 tests of independence were performed to evaluate the significance of the difference between the groups.


RESULTS
Five of 6 (83.3%) cases of tuberculous epidural abscess had an intact anterior meningovertebral ligament, and 0/35 cases of pyogenic epidural abscess demonstrated an intact ligament (P < .001). The presence of an intact anterior meningovertebral ligament had 83.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity for tuberculous spondylodiscitis, a 100% positive predictive value, and a 97.2% negative predictive value.

The presence of an intact anterior meningovertebral ligament has high sensitivity and specificity for tuberculous spondylodiscitis-associated epidural abscess, though these results should be validated in a larger sample.",S R Gordon;J Burns;J A Bello;S E Slasky

805,Marion A Deroche,"The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a mesocorticolimbic structure that integrates cognitive, emotional and motor functions. Although its role in psychiatric disorders is widely acknowledged, the understanding of its circuitry is not complete. Here we combined optogenetic and whole-cell recordings to draw a functional portrait of excitatory disambiguated synapses onto D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the adult male mouse NAc core. Comparing synaptic properties of ventral hippocampus (vHipp), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) inputs revealed a hierarchy of synaptic inputs that depends on the identity of the postsynaptic target MSN. Thus, the BLA is the dominant excitatory pathway onto D1 MSNs (BLA > PFC = vHipp) while PFC inputs dominate D2 MSNs (PFC > vHipp > BLA). We also tested the hypothesis that endocannabinoids endow excitatory circuits with pathway- and cell-specific plasticity. Thus, while CB1 receptors (CB1R) uniformly depress excitatory pathways irrespective of MSNs identity, TRPV1 receptors (TRPV1R) bidirectionally control inputs onto the NAc core in a pathway-specific manner. Finally, we show that the interplay of TRPV1R/CB1R shapes plasticity at BLA-NAc synapses. Together these data shed new light on synapse and circuit specificity in the adult NAc core and illustrate how endocannabinoids contribute to pathway-specific synaptic plasticity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe examined the impact of connections from the ventral hippocampus (vHipp,) basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) onto identified medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the adult accumbens core.

The effect of the SHP2 inhibitor NSC-87877 on MuSK phosphorylation and AChR clustering was tested in C2C12 myotubes with 31 MuSK-myasthenia gravis (MG) sera and purified MuSK-MG IgG4 preparations.


RESULTS
In the absence of MuSK-MG Abs, NSC-87877 increased MuSK phosphorylation and the number of AChR clusters in C2C12 myotubes in vitro and in DOK7-overexpressing C2C12 myotubes that form spontaneous AChR clusters. In the presence of MuSK-MG sera, the AChR clusters were reduced, as expected, but NSC-87877 was able to protect or restore the clusters. Two purified MuSK-MG IgG4 preparations inhibited both MuSK phosphorylation and AChR cluster formation, and in both, clusters were restored with NSC-87877.


CONCLUSIONS
Stimulating the agrin-LRP4-MuSK-DOK7 AChR clustering pathway with NSC-87877, or other drugs, could represent a novel therapeutic approach for MuSK-MG and could potentially improve other NMJ disorders with reduced AChR numbers or disrupted NMJs.",Michelangelo Cao;Anna De Rosa;Mark Woodhall;Pedro M Rodriguez Cruz;Judith Cossins;Michelangelo Maestri;Roberta Ricciardi;Amelia Evoli;David Beeson;Angela Vincent
807,Katharina Feil,"OBJECTIVE
To determine feasibility and safety of stroke care organization within our Neurovascular Network of Southwest Bavaria (NEVAS) in a rural area with distances of up to 100 kilometers, we compared patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in large vessel occlusion admitted directly to our center (direct to center [DTC]) to patients who were transferred for MT via NEVAS (drip and ship [DS]).


METHODS
This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of all MT patients between January 2015 and May 2018. Successful recanalization was defined as a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b-3. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) was defined according to European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study 3. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 3 months indicated good outcome.


RESULTS
MT was performed in 410 patients: 221 DTC and 189 DS. Median NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 16 and premorbid mRS score was 0. Thrombolysis was applied in 62.2% with the same time from symptom onset in both groups (94.5 vs 95 minutes). Successful recanalization (79.3% vs 77.8%) and NIHSS score reduction from admission to discharge (16-7 vs 17-6) were comparable. Time delay from onset to revascularization was 96 minutes in DS (212 vs 308 minutes, p = 0.001). At follow-up, DTC patients had a trend to better outcome (33.5% vs 24.3%, p = 0.056). Neither sICH (6.3% vs 5.9%, p = 0.840) nor mortality (31.2% vs 34.4%, p = 0.387) differed between the groups.


CONCLUSION
DS patients benefit from MT without relevant safety concerns, but with a trend to unfavorable outcome compared to DTC patients. These results suggest that DS is suitable to provide MT in rural areas where DTC is not possible.",Jan Rémi;Clemens Küpper;Moriz Herzberg;Franziska Dorn;Wolfgang G Kunz;Lukas T Rotkopf;Johanna Heinrich;Katharina Müller;Christoph Laub;Johannes Levin;Katrin Hüttemann;Rainer Dabitz;Robert Müller;Frank A Wollenweber;Thomas Pfefferkorn;Gerhard F Hamann;Thomas Liebig;Marianne Dieterich;Lars Kellert
808,Alexander F Lipka,"OBJECTIVE
To study survival and to characterize long-term functional impairments and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).


METHODS
In this observational study, survival of patients with LEMS, separately for nontumor (NT) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), was compared to that of the Dutch general population and patients with SCLC. Disease course in patients with LEMS was recorded retrospectively. Several scales for functional impairments and health-related quality of life were assessed.


RESULTS
We included 150 patients with LEMS. Survival was similar to that of the general population in 65 patients with NT-LEMS. Tumor survival was significantly longer in 81 patients with SCLC-LEMS compared to patients with non-LEMS SCLC (overall median survival 17 vs 7.0 months, p < 0.0001). At diagnosis, 39 (62%) of 63 patients with complete follow-up data were independent for activities of daily living, improving to 85% at the 1-year follow-up. The physical HRQOL composite score (55.9) was significantly lower than in the general population (76.3, p < 0.0001) and comparable to that of patients with myasthenia gravis (60.5). The mental HRQOL composite score was 71.8 in patients with LEMS, comparable to that of the general population (77.9, p = 0.19) and patients with myasthenia gravis (70.3).


CONCLUSIONS
This study shows that patients with NT-LEMS have normal survival. Patients with SCLC-LEMS have an improved tumor survival, even after correction for tumor stage. A majority of patients with LEMS report a stable disease course and remain or become independent for self-care after treatment.",Marion I Boldingh;Erik W van Zwet;Marco W J Schreurs;Jan B M Kuks;Chantal M Tallaksen;Maarten J Titulaer;Jan J G M Verschuuren
809,Audrey C Leasure,"OBJECTIVE
To estimate the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) recurrence in a large, diverse, US-based population and to identify racial/ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups at higher risk.


METHODS
We performed a longitudinal analysis of prospectively collected claims data from all hospitalizations in nonfederal California hospitals between 2005 and 2011. We used validated diagnosis codes to identify nontraumatic ICH and our primary outcome of recurrent ICH. California residents who survived to discharge were included. We used log-rank tests for unadjusted analyses of survival across racial/ethnic groups and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to determine factors associated with risk of recurrence after adjusting for potential confounders.


RESULTS
We identified 31,355 California residents with first-recorded ICH who survived to discharge, of whom 15,548 (50%) were white, 6,174 (20%) were Hispanic, 4,205 (14%) were Asian, and 2,772 (9%) were black. There were 1,330 recurrences (4.1%) over a median follow-up of 2.9 years (interquartile range 3.8). The 1-year recurrence rate was 3.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8%-3.2%). In multivariable analysis, black participants (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.48; p = 0.04) and Asian participants (HR 1.29; 95% CI 1.10-1.50; p = 0.001) had a higher risk of recurrence than white participants. Private insurance was associated with a significant reduction in risk compared to patients with Medicare (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.50-0.73; p < 0.001), with consistent estimates across racial/ethnic groups.

810,Sied Kebir,"OBJECTIVE
To determine the role of olfactory function in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) as a prognostic clinical measure.


METHODS
In a prospective case-control study, olfactory testing was performed in 73 patients with primary GBM at baseline during first-line treatment and at later follow-ups. An age-matched control cohort consisted of 49 patients with neurologic diseases, excluding those known to affect olfactory function per se. Depending on the olfactory testing score, patients were allotted to a hyposmia group (HG) or normosmia group (NG). MRI analysis was performed to assess whether tumor location affects olfactory pathways.


RESULTS
Patients with GBM had olfactory dysfunction significantly more often compared to the control cohort (p = 0.003). Tumor location could not explain this finding since no relevant difference in MRI-based olfactory pathway involvement was found between HG and NG (p = 0.131). Patients with olfactory dysfunction had significantly worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those without dysfunction (median OS 20.9 vs 40.6 months, p = 0.035; median PFS, 9 vs 19 months, p = 0.022). Multivariate analysis in patients without MRI-based involvement of olfactory pathways confirmed olfaction is an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43; p = 0.042) and PFS (HR 0.51; p = 0.049).


CONCLUSION
This pilot study provides the first indication that olfactory dysfunction is frequently observed in GBM and may be associated with worse survival outcome in GBM. However, validation of these results in an independent cohort is needed.",Elke Hattingen;Michael Niessen;Laurèl Rauschenbach;Rolf Fimmers;Thomas Hummel;Niklas Schäfer;Lazaros Lazaridis;Christoph Kleinschnitz;Ulrich Herrlinger;Björn Scheffler;Martin Glas
811,Carlo Pancaro,"OBJECTIVE
To determine whether the sacral anatomical interspace landmark (SAIL) technique is more accurate than the classic intercristal line (ICL) technique in pregnant patients and to assess the percentage of clinical determinations above the third lumbar vertebra.


METHODS
In this prospective, randomized, open-label trial, there were 110 singleton pregnant patients with gestational age greater than 37 weeks included. Selection procedure was a convenience sample of pregnant patients who presented for office visits or vaginal or cesarean delivery between March 15 and July 31, 2018, at a single-center obstetric tertiary care university hospital. Both techniques were evaluated by 2 physicians independently assessing each method. Before data collection, we hypothesized that the SAIL technique would be more accurate than the ICL technique in determining the L4-L5 interspace, and that the SAIL technique would produce more estimations below the third lumbar vertebra than the ICL technique. Therefore, the primary outcome was accuracy in identifying the L4-L5 lumbar interspace with SAIL vs ICL. The secondary outcome was difference in clinical assessments above the third lumbar vertebra. Both outcomes were measured via ultrasonography.


RESULTS
Patients were 31 ± 5 years of age (mean ± SD) and had body mass index of 31.8 ± 5.7 kg/m2 and gestational age of 38.8 ± 1.1 weeks. A total of 110 patients were analyzed. SAIL correctly identified the L4-L5 interspace 49% of the time vs 8% using ICL (p < 0.0001). Estimations above L3 were 1% for SAIL vs 31% for ICL (p < 0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study shows improved accuracy in identifying intervertebral space using the SAIL technique; this may prevent direct mechanical trauma to the conus medullaris when lumbar punctures are performed in pregnancy.

812,Olafur Sveinsson,"OBJECTIVE
We conducted a nationwide case-control study in Sweden to test the hypothesis that specific clinical characteristics are associated with increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).


METHODS
The study included 255 SUDEP cases (definite and probable) and 1,148 matched controls. Clinical information was obtained from medical records and the National Patient Register. The association between SUDEP and potential risk factors was assessed by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and interaction assessed by attributable proportion due to interaction (AP).


RESULTS
Experiencing generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) during the preceding year was associated with a 27-fold increased risk (OR 26.81, 95% CI 14.86-48.38), whereas no excess risk was seen in those with exclusively non-GTCS seizures (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.54-48.38). The presence of nocturnal GTCS during the last year of observation was associated with a 15-fold risk (OR 15.31, 95% CI 9.57-24.47). Living alone was associated with a 5-fold increased risk of SUDEP (OR 5.01, 95% CI 2.93-8.57) and interaction analysis showed that the combination of not sharing a bedroom and having GTCS conferred an OR of 67.10 (95% CI 29.66-151.88), with AP estimated at 0.69 (CI 0.53-0.85). Among comorbid diseases, a previous diagnosis of substance abuse or alcohol dependence was associated with excess risk of SUDEP.


CONCLUSIONS
Individuals with GTCS who sleep alone have a dramatically increased SUDEP risk. Our results indicate that 69% of SUDEP cases in patients who have GTCS and live alone could be prevented if the patients were not unattended at night or were free from GTCS.",Tomas Andersson;Peter Mattsson;Sofia Carlsson;Torbjörn Tomson
813,Thomas Rambaud,"OBJECTIVE
Adolescence represents a transition period between childhood and adulthood, and only limited information exists about stroke characteristics in this population. Our aim was to describe the clinical and neuroradiologic features, etiologies, initial management, and outcome of ischemic stroke in adolescents.


METHODS
This retrospective cohort study evaluated all consecutive patients 10 to 18 years with a first-ever ischemic stroke hospitalized between 2007 and 2017 in 10 French academic centers representing a population of ≈10 million. Extracted data from the national database served as validation.


RESULTS
A total of 60 patients were included (53% male, median age 15.2 years). Diagnosis at first medical contact was misevaluated in 36%, more frequently in posterior than anterior circulation strokes (55% vs 20% respectively, odds ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 1.41-16.40, p = 0.01). Recanalization treatment rate was high (n = 19, 32%): IV thrombolysis (17%), endovascular therapy (11.7%), or both IV and intra-arterial thrombolysis (3.3%); safety was good (only 1 asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation). Despite thorough etiologic workup, 50% of strokes remained cryptogenic. The most common determined etiologies were cardioembolism (15%), vasculitis and autoimmune disorders (12%, occurring exclusively in female patients), and arterial dissections (10%, exclusively in male patients). Recurrent ischemic cerebrovascular events occurred in 12% (median follow-up 19 months). Recurrence rate was 50% in patients with identified vasculopathy but 0% after cryptogenic stroke. Functional outcome was favorable (Rankin Scale score 0-2 at day 90) in 80% of cases.

814,Stuart J McCarter,"OBJECTIVE
To determine whether quantitative polysomnographic REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) distinguishes between cognitive impairment phenotypes.


BACKGROUND
Neurodegenerative cognitive impairment in older adults predominantly correlates with tauopathy or synucleinopathy. Accurate antemortem phenotypic diagnosis has important prognostic and treatment implications; additional clinical tools might distinguish between dementia syndromes.


METHODS
We quantitatively analyzed RSWA in 61 older adults who underwent polysomnography including 46 with cognitive impairment (20 probable synucleinopathy), 26 probable non-synucleinopathy (15 probable Alzheimer disease, 11 frontotemporal lobar dementia), and 15 age- and sex-matched controls. Submentalis and anterior tibialis RSWA metrics and automated REM atonia index were calculated. Group statistical comparisons and regression were performed, and receiver operating characteristic curves determined diagnostic RSWA thresholds that best distinguished synucleinopathy phenotype.


RESULTS
Submentalis-but not anterior tibialis RSWA-was greater in synucleinopathy than nonsynucleinopathy; several RSWA diagnostic thresholds distinguished synucleinopathy with excellent specificity including submentalis tonic, 5.6% (area under the curve [AUC] 0.791); submentalis any, 15.0% (AUC 0.871); submentalis phasic, 10.8% (AUC 0.863); and anterior tibialis phasic, 31.4% (AUC 0.694). In the subset of patients without dream enactment behaviors, submentalis RSWA was also greater in patients with synucleinopathy than in those without synucleinopathy. RSWA was detected more frequently by quantitative than qualitative methods (p = 0.0001).


CONCLUSION
Elevated submentalis RSWA distinguishes probable synucleinopathy from probable nonsynucleinopathy in cognitively impaired older adults, even in the absence of clinical dream enactment symptoms.

815,Alex Tsui,"OBJECTIVE
To determine whether hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) dysfunction is prospectively associated with global cognitive impairment in later life.


METHODS
This cross-cohort study integrates 2 large longitudinal datasets, Whitehall II and the National Survey for Health and Development (NSHD), on data collected in the Whitehall II study between 2002-2004, 2007-2009, and 2012-2013; and for NSHD between 2006-2010 and in 2015. Serial salivary cortisol samples were collected multiple times within a 24-hour period at mean ages 61.2 and 65.9 years in Whitehall II and at age 60-64 years from NSHD participants. Cortisol profile is defined using cortisol awakening response and am:pm ratio. Cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination in Whitehall II and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, third version, in NSHD, harmonized into a 30-point score. Models were adjusted for age, sex, diagnoses of hypertension and diabetes, body mass index (BMI), educational attainment, and interval between HPAA and cognitive assessments.


RESULTS
In fully adjusted models, increased am:pm cortisol ratio was prospectively associated with better later-life cognitive function years later (0.02 fewer errors per SD increase in am:pm cortisol ratio, p < 0.01) and verbal fluency (0.03 SD increase in verbal fluency per SD increase in am:pm ratio, p < 0.01). Increasing age, lower educational attainment, diagnosis of hypertension, diagnosis of diabetes, and increased BMI were associated with worse cognitive function and poorer verbal fluency. There were no associations between depression and later-life cognition or reverse associations between cognition and later-life cortisol profiles.


CONCLUSIONS
Loss of diurnal HPAA variation is evident in individuals subsequently experiencing more cognitive impairment. It may serve as an early preclinical marker of cognitive decline.",Marcus Richards;Archana Singh-Manoux;Chinedu Udeh-Momoh;Daniel Davis
816,Luigia Cristino,"Anecdotal evidence that cannabis preparations have medical benefits together with the discovery of the psychotropic plant cannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) initiated efforts to develop cannabinoid-based therapeutics. These efforts have been marked by disappointment, especially in relation to the unwanted central effects that result from activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), which have limited the therapeutic use of drugs that activate or inactivate this receptor. The discovery of CB2 and of endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligands (endocannabinoids) raised new possibilities for safe targeting of this endocannabinoid system. However, clinical success has been limited, complicated by the discovery of an expanded endocannabinoid system - known as the endocannabinoidome - that includes several mediators that are biochemically related to the endocannabinoids, and their receptors and metabolic enzymes. The approvals of nabiximols, a mixture of THC and the non-psychotropic cannabinoid cannabidiol, for the treatment of spasticity and neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis, and of purified botanical cannabidiol for the treatment of otherwise untreatable forms of paediatric epilepsy, have brought the therapeutic use of cannabinoids and endocannabinoids in neurological diseases into the limelight. In this Review, we provide an overview of the endocannabinoid system and the endocannabinoidome before discussing their involvement in and clinical relevance to a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, stroke, epilepsy and glioblastoma.",Tiziana Bisogno;Vincenzo Di Marzo

Materials and Methods We conducted a retrospective study at the Neurology Outpatient Clinic of the National Hospital of Niamey (Niger) over a period of 5 years from May 2013 to May 2018, collecting all cases of patients aged 60 years or over diagnosed with epilepsy by neurologists. From the registers of consultation, we collected and analyzed for each patient the demographic, clinical, etiological, and therapeutic data, as well as the outcomes during follow-up visits. Results Of the 4,576 patients of all ages seen during the period of our study, we included 62 patients aged 60 years or over diagnosed with epilepsy with a hospital frequency of 1.35%. The mean age of patients was 65.82 ± 5.72 years (range: 60 and 83 years) with a predominance of the male sex (sex ratio at 1.6). Patients aged 60 to 64 years were the most represented (43.5%). Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were the most frequent (41.9%), followed by focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (25.8%). All patients underwent electroencephalogram. Only 30 patients (48.4%) underwent brain imaging, and mainly brain computed tomography scan. The etiologies included poststroke epilepsy (25.8%), brain tumors (3.2%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (3.2%), and cerebral meningioma (1.6%). We found 41 cases (66.1%) of epilepsy without definite etiology and with an incomplete workup. Carbamazepine and phenobarbital were the only two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used.

818,Anish Mehta,"Background Out of several neuroprotective drugs (NPDs) studied in animals and humans, four NPDs (citicoline, edaravone, cerebrolysin, and minocycline) have been found to have beneficial effects in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Objective The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of citicoline, edaravone, minocycline, and cerebrolysin compared with placebo in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory AIS. Materials and Methods This was a prospective, single center, single-blinded, and hospital-based study. One hundred patients with MCA territory AIS with 20 patients in each group including control group were included. Barthel index (BI), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and modified Rankin Scale score were recorded at admission, at day 11 and after 90 days. Results The mean NIHSS score was significantly lesser at day 11 and after 90 days in citicoline, edaravone, and cerebrolysin group in comparison with placebo. Similarly, the mean BI score was significantly higher at day 11 and after 90 days in citicoline, edaravone, and cerebrolysin group in comparison with placebo. In minocycline group, there was no significant change in the NIHSS score and BI score at day 11 and after 90 days.

819,Porntip Parmontree,"Background Early posttraumatic seizure (PTS) is a significant cause of unfavorable outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study was aimed to investigate the incidence and determine a predictive model for early PTS. Materials and Methods A prospective cohort study of 484 TBI patients was conducted. All patients were evaluated for seizure activities within 7 days after the injury. Risk factors for early PTS were identified using univariate analysis. The candidate risk factors with p < 0.1 were selected into multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of early PTS. The fitting model and the power of discrimination with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve were demonstrated. The nomogram for prediction of early PTS was developed for individuals. Results There were 27 patients (5.6%) with early PTS in this study. The final model illustrated chronic alcohol use (odds ratio [OR]: 4.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.64-10.07), epidural hematoma (OR: 3.98, 95% CI: 1.70-9.33), and Glasgow Coma Scale score 3-8 (OR: 3.78, 95% CI: 1.53-9.35) as predictors of early PTS.

821,Renu Bala,"Background Transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumors is the neurosurgical procedure of choice to excise most of the tumors of the sellar/suprasellar region. The main goals of anesthesia are maintenance of hemodynamic stability, provision of conditions that facilitate good surgical exposure, and a prompt and smooth emergence to allow neurological and visual assessment. Dexmedetomidine (Dex), a selective α-2 agonist, is known to maintain cardiovascular stability and anxiolysis and provide pain relief. Therefore, we hypothesized that intraoperative Dex will attenuate hemodynamic response to nasal speculum (NS) insertion, decrease analgesic requirement, and hasten postoperative recovery. Materials and Methods This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 60 adult patients of either sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists status I or II undergoing elective pituitary surgery for excision of pituitary adenoma. Randomization was done into two groups; Group D ( n = 30) received Dex bolus 1 μg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by 0.5 μg/kg/h, and group control Group C ( n = 30) received normal saline (0.9%) in a similar manner. A standard anesthesia technique comprising fentanyl, propofol, rocuronium, sevoflurane, nitrous oxide, and oxygen was used. Intraoperative monitoring was uniform and standardized in all the patients; cardiovascular perturbations, if any, were noted and managed appropriately. After completion of surgery, tracheal extubation was performed, and emergence time, extubation time, modified Aldrete score, sedation, pain, time for first analgesic, nausea, vomiting, and shivering were recorded. Results In both the groups, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure occurred at the time of laryngoscopy and intubation, NS insertion, and extubation, but it was more in Group C ( p < 0.05). In Group D, intraoperative requirement of analgesic, neuromuscular relaxant, and inhalational anesthetic was lesser compared with Group C. Emergence time as well as visual analog scale at emergence was less in Group D. Conclusions Intraoperative Dex infusion is a reasonable choice in patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary surgery.",Arvind Chaturvedi;Mihir Prakash Pandia;Parmod K Bithal
822,Shearwood McClelland,"Background Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a popular alternative to conventional radiation therapy (RT) over the past 15 years. Unfortunately, the impact of patient distance from radiation treatment centers and utilization of SBRT versus conventional RT has been sparsely investigated. This report represents the first analysis of the impact of patient distance on radiation treatment modality for central nervous system (CNS) disease. Materials and Methods Since the inception of our RADIation oncology And Neuro-Surgery (RADIANS) multidisciplinary clinic at a community hospital in 2016, 27 patients have received either SBRT or conventional RT as their sole radiation treatment modality for CNS disease. Twenty-four (88.9%) presented with metastatic disease. Fisher's exact test evaluated the relationship between patient residence from treatment (in miles) and radiation treatment modality received. Results Mean patient distance from our RADIANS clinic was 50.6 miles (median = 15.3). Twenty-one patients (77.8%) received SBRT; the remaining six received conventional RT. Mean patient distance from SBRT was 63.6 miles, and mean patient distance for conventional RT was 5.1 miles; this finding was statistically significant ( p = 0.0433; 95% confidence interval = 1.9-115.1). Conclusion Our findings indicate that patients with CNS disease who receive SBRT over conventional RT are statistically more likely to reside further from treatment centers. This is similar to findings of national studies comparing proton versus photon treatment for pediatric solid malignancies. The results from our work have implications for neuro-oncology treatment and the development of community hospital-based clinic models similar to RADIANS in the future.",Timur Mitin;Jerry J Jaboin;Jeremy N Ciporen

Patients with NEPE between January 2014 and August 2016 aged < 18 years were enrolled. NEPEs were diagnosed on the basis of history, home video, and EEG recordings. Patients were divided into different categories according to age, specific type of disorder, and system responsible. Patients were followed for their NEPE frequency and outcome. Results A total of 3,660 children presented with paroxysmal events; of them 8% were diagnosed with NEPE. Patients diagnosed with NEPE were classified into three age groups on the basis of their age of onset of symptom; of the total 285 patients, there were 2 neonates (0.7%), 160 infants (56%), and 123 children and adolescents (43.1%). Fifty-eight percent patients were boys. The most common diagnoses were breath-holding spells 113 (39%), followed by syncope 38 (13.3%) and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures 37 (12.9%). About 9 and 5% of patients had concomitant epilepsy and developmental delay, respectively. Conclusions NEPEs account for 8% of paroxysmal events. Most common NEPEs were breath-holding spells among infants and syncope and ""psychogenic nonepileptic seizures"" in children and adolescents.",Raghavendraswami Amoghimath;Naveen Benakappa;Sanjay K Shivappa
824,Roshan Koul,"Objective Pyridoxine responsive seizures (PDRs) are characterized by early-onset seizures and epileptic encephalopathy (neonates and infants) which respond to pyridoxine. Any type of seizures can be the first presentation of PDRs in these children. The aim of this 20-year retrospective study was to report the profile of 35 children with PDRs. Materials and Methods Neonatal and infantile seizures responding to pyridoxine were analyzed retrospectively from 1998 to 2018. Depending on the clinical features, laboratory results, and genetic study, they were divided into following four groups: (A) responders with α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase 7A1 ( ALDH7A1 ) mutation, (B) responders with pyridoxal phosphate homeostasis protein (PLPHP) mutation, (C) responders with none of these two known mutations, (D) and responders in combination with antiepileptic medications. Results Sixteen of 35 children had genetic mutation, 4 with ALDH7A1 mutation, and 12 with PLPHP mutation recently described. Nineteen of 35 children had no genetic positivity. Conclusion A large number of children with pyridoxine response do not have known genetic confirmation. Over time, new genes, responsible for pyridoxine dependency, may be identified or an unknown metabolic disorder may be seen in these children.",Amna Alfutaisi;Rana Abdelrahim;Khalid Altihilli
825,Meena Kolar Sridara Murthy,"Background Although epilepsy is a common disorder, it is highly stigmatized. Not only public but even teachers are not free from stigmatization and cultural barriers. Under this condition, children with epilepsy are more vulnerable for stigmatization, social isolation, lack of support, and psychological and emotional problems. At the same time, there is an immediate need of literature focusing on intervention studies to change the attitudes of school teachers and children. Materials and Methods The study was conducted with the objectives to evaluate knowledge, attitude, and practices about epilepsy among school teachers and children; provide educational training program to teachers; and check the efficacy of training program imparted by teacher and trainer. Results Repeated measure of analysis of variance shows that knowledge ( F = 1134.875, p < 0.001), attitude ( F = 2429.909, p < 0.001), and practice ( F = 2205.122, p < 0.001) are significantly different between pre- and posttest indicated by Pillai's trace test. Similarly, from the Pillai's test knowledge ( F = 49.317, p < 0.001), attitude ( F = 125.304, p < 0.001) and practice ( F = 178.697, p < 0.001) are significantly different among the teachers, trainer imparted training group of children, and teachers imparted training group of children groups. It is seen that knowledge, attitude, and practice scores significantly differ between two time points and across three groups. Among all the groups, teachers imparted training group children had high level of practice. Conclusion Inclusion of health education programs in the textbooks and health education schemes for teachers and school children is a crucial way to bring a change in their attitude, behavior, and practices.",Prakashi Rajaram;Kannappa Shetty Mudiyanuru;P Marimuthu;Lakshmana Govindappa;Madhuporna Dasgupta
826,Vanitha Rajagopalan,"Background Major blood loss during neurosurgery can lead to several complications, including life-threatening hemodynamic instabilities. Studies addressing these complications in patients undergoing intracranial tumor surgery are limited. Materials and Methods During the study period, 456 patients who underwent elective craniotomy for brain tumor excision were categorized into four groups on the basis of estimated intraoperative blood volume loss: Group A (<20%), Group B (20-50%), Group C (>50-100%), and Group D (more than estimated blood volume). The occurrence of various perioperative complications was correlated with these groups to identify if there was any association with the amount of intraoperative blood loss. Results The average blood volume loss was 11% ± 5.3% in Group A, 29.8% ± 7.9% in Group B, 68.3% ± 13.5% in Group C, and 129.1% ± 23.9% in Group D. Variables identified as risk factors for intraoperative bleeding were female gender ( p < 0.001), hypertension ( p = 0.008), tumor size >5 cm ( p < 0.001), high-grade glioma ( p = 0.004), meningioma ( p < 0.001), mass effect ( p = 0.002), midline shift ( p = 0.014), highly vascular tumors documented on preoperative imaging ( p < 0.001), extended craniotomy approach ( p = 0.002), intraoperative colloids use >1,000 mL ( p < 0.001), intraoperative brain bulge ( p = 0.03), intraoperative appearance as highly vascular tumor ( p < 0.001), and duration of surgery >300 minutes ( p < 0.001).

827,Ritesh Lamsal,"Background and Objectives Suboptimal management of postcraniotomy pain causes sympathetic and hemodynamic perturbations, leading to deleterious effects on the neurological system and overall patient outcome. Opioids are the mainstay of postoperative pain management but have various problems when given in high doses, or for prolonged durations in neurosurgical patients. The ideal method of pain control following craniotomy generally relies on a combination of various drugs. Oral pregabalin may be an attractive alternative in these patients. Materials and Methods Sixty, American Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II patients posted for elective supratentorial craniotomy, aged 18 and 60 years, were randomly assigned into three groups of 20 each to receive oral placebo (Group A), pregabalin 75 mg (Group B), or pregabalin 150 mg (Group C) before the induction of anesthesia. At the end of the surgery, patient-controlled analgesia was started with intravenous fentanyl. Visual analog scale (VAS) score was recorded every 2 hours for 24 hours, along with total postoperative fentanyl requirement. Results There were no differences in sex, duration of surgery or anesthesia and total intraoperative fentanyl administered among the three groups. The median postoperative VAS score (Group A-18.0, Group B-20, and Group C-22.0; p = 0.63) was similar in all the groups. However, postoperative fentanyl requirement over 24 hours was least in the group that received 150 mg pregabalin (Group A-190 μg, Group B-240 μg, and Group C-100 μg; p = 0.03). Conclusions Even though pain scores were not significantly different, patients receiving 150 mg oral pregabalin required the least amount of postoperative opioids.",Charu Mahajan;Vikas Chauhan;Nidhi Gupta;Nitasha Mishra;Girija Prasad Rath
828,K G Ashwath,"Background Since histopathology is available only after surgery, clinical condition and radiological characters of the tumor are important factors on which a clinician counsels the patient of brain tumor to take a decision regarding the management. Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a marker of inflammation can be used as a prognostic marker to predict the survival in high-grade gliomas and metastases. We evaluated the utility of NLR as an adjunct tool in predicting the histopathological grade of brain tumors. Materials and Methods One hundred sixteen patients with a diagnosis of brain tumors planned for surgical excision or biopsy were enrolled in the study. NLR was estimated in the preoperative blood sample. Patients were grouped into low- and highgrade brain tumors and their mean NLRs were analyzed. Similar evaluation was carried out between the intra- and extra-axial tumors. Results Mean age of the study group was 40.14 years with 61 males. Seventy-eight patients had low-grade tumor and 38 patients had high-grade tumor. Sixty patients had extra-axial tumors and 56 patients had intra-axial tumors. The mean NLR of low-grade tumors was 1.68 ± 0.53 and that of high-grade tumors was 3.12 ± 0.74. NLR > 2.4 can be used to identify high-grade brain tumors with a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 92%, positive predictive value of 82.1%, negative predictive value of 91%, an excellent impact with likelihood ratio (+) of 10.1, and an odds ratio of 54.1. The mean NLR of extra-axial tumors was 1.68 + 0.62 and that of intra-axial tumors was 2.64 ± 0.91. These observations were statistically significant with p -value < 0.05. Conclusions NLR is an easily available and inexpensive marker of systemic inflammation, which varies across different histopathological grades of brain tumors. Mean NLR is higher in high-grade tumors and also intra-axial tumors with a cutoff value of NLR > 2.4 and > 2.0, respectively.",Ashish Aggarwal;Kokkula Praneeth;Navneet Singla;Kirti Gupta
829,Toyin A Oyemolade,"Background In Nigeria, pre-neurosurgical care of most neurotrauma patients usually involves administration of many empirical agents including antibiotics with no apparent indications. This practice is fraught with two particular dangers: increase in health care costs and development of drug resistance. This study aimed to interrogate antibiotic stewardship in the pre-neurosurgical care of neurotrauma patients referred to our practice. Materials and Methods This 7-month prospective descriptive study was performed in one University Teaching Hospital of a developing country. Clinical data on all admitted neurotrauma patients with information on the pre-neurosurgical treatment received were captured and analyzed. Results There were 113 patients, 87(77.0%) males; 103(91.2%) had head injury, and 10(8.8%) spinal cord injury. Associated systemic injuries occurred in 47(41.6%): 40 involved skeletal and soft tissue systems, and 12(10.6%) presented with aspiration pneumonitis. These patients were referrals from public health facilities including primary health facilities (PHF), secondary (SHF), and tertiary (THF), as well as private clinics (PC). Antibiotics were given to 74 (65.5%) patients, with a probabilistic indication in only 17.6% (13/74) of these. The proportional distribution of this antibiotic administration according to the referral base was not statistically significant (χ 2 =6.87, p = 0.3): 70% (14/20) from PHF, 56% (14/25) from SHF, 71% (23/32) from THF, and 63% (23/36) from PC. The antimicrobial agent administered was specified in 40 cases: Ceftriaxone was the commonest antibiotic agent implicated. Conclusion There is apparent unnecessary exposure of patients to antibiotics in the pre-neurosurgical care of neurotrauma in this study. There is, therefore, need for education on antibiotic stewardship to the group of health workers involved.",Toluyemi A Malomo;Amos O Adeleye
830,Sailaxmi Gandhi,"Background Caregivers of patients admitted to neurorehabilitation wards may experience higher psychological distress (PD) and poor mental well-being (MWB). This study aimed to empower caregivers to cope effectively with PD and maintain well-being by practicing yoga. Materials and Methods A total of 34 caregivers were randomized to the experimental group (EG) and waitlisted control group in a multiphase manner. Data were collected using sociodemographic schedule, Kessler's Psychological Distress scale-10, and Warwick-Edinburgh's Mental Well-being Scale. Caregivers' yoga module (CYM) consisting of satsanga (theory), asanas (postures), pranayama (breath control), imagery, meditation, and relaxation techniques was taught to those in the EG at 35 m/d for eight consecutive days. They were encouraged to continue on their own for another 3 weeks. Posttest data were collected from both groups on the 15th and 29th days. Analysis was done with IBM SPSS statistics version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Results There was statistically significant reduction of PD and improvement of MWB among caregivers of EG within (PD: F = 17.78, p < 0.001; MWB: F = 5.48, p < 0.03) and between (PD: F = 15.87, p < 0.001; MWB: F = 15.87, p < 0.01) the groups after the CYM. A significant negative correlation was found between pretest MWB and PD ( r =-0.579, p < 0.01).

831,James A Balogun,"Background The management of severe traumatic brain injury is directed at avoidance of secondary brain injuries. The intensive care unit (ICU) provides the ideal environment to achieving improved survival and functional outcome. The study sets out to identify the factors that determine the access of patients with severe head injury presenting at our hospital, to the ICU and their impact on outcome. Materials and Methods his was a longitudinal study at the University College Hospital, Ibadan. Data of all consecutive severe head injury patients over a 9-month period, presenting to the accident and emergency department, was collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-squared test. The level of significance was p < 0.05. Result There were 36 males (80.0%) in our study, with road crashes (25; 79.5%) as the most common mechanism of injury. Most patients (33; 73.3%) were transferred to our center after initial care in another hospital. Though 31(68.9%) patients had access to the ICU, they were all delayed, with the most common reason for the delay being lack of ICU space. More patients who got admitted into ICU (14; 45.2%) were alive at 28 days into admission ( p = 0.04). The females (6; 13.3%) significantly survived till 28 days on admission compared with males ( p = 0.03), but there was no difference in the survival rates between children and adults. Conclusion Our study underscores the need for ICU admission in these patients to optimize outcome and identify the nonavailability of beds, as the most important cause of delayed access, as well as the need for increased manpower capacity and organized resource utilization.",Obioma Akwada;Emily Awana;Folusho M Balogun
832,Fayaz Khan,"Objective The aim of this study is to compare the isokinetic knee muscles peak torque measurements and proprioception between the affected and intact limbs of patients with stroke, in addition to finding the correlation between knee muscles strength and lower limb function. Methods Twelve patients with stroke (mean age 64.33 ± 6.140 years), with 3 to 7 months poststroke who can walk 25 feet independently without using or using assistive devices and full passive range of motion were included in the study. Biodex isokinetic dynamometer was used for measuring isokinetic strength at 90°/s, 120°/s, and 150°/s and isometric strength at 60°/s in both flexors and extensors of the knee, whereas proprioception was measured at 45°/s knee flexion, all for affected and intact limbs. Functional measurements were assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Lower Limb scale and Barthel Index (BI). Results The differences shown were found to be statistically significant between affected and intact limbs in isokinetic 90°/s flexion ( p = 0.005), extension ( p = 0.0013), and isometric at 60°/s flexion ( p < 0.0001) knee muscle strengths and also the proprioception ( p = 0.05). Significant positive correlation was found between isokinetic affected side knee flexion at 90°/s ( r = 0.903) with BI ( r = 0.704). Conclusion There is a significant difference in peak torque measurements between affected and normal lower limbs of poststroke patients, as well as a significant correlation between the knee strength and lower limb functions.

T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement revealed prominent enhancement of the intraosseous lesion and dura mater. Following the removal of the tumor body and bone lesion, we performed immunohistochemical staining for osteopontin (OPN), matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP2), and integrin β-1 (CD29). The tumor body was immunoreactive for OPN and CD29, but not MMP2, whereas, the bone lesion was immunoreactive for all the three antigens.

The humanized anti-α4 integrin monoclonal antibody natalizumab has proven to be very effective in patients with highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), but harbors the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Recently, new therapeutic options have become available for patients with high risk of developing PML while on natalizumab treatment. One of these new therapeutics is the oral synthetic purine analogue cladribine. In order to determine whether therapy with cladribine is effective and safe in patients with MS who previously had been treated with natalizumab, we analyzed clinical, radiological, and laboratory data of 17 patients whose disease modifying treatment (DMT) was switched from natalizumab to cladribine.


Methods
A total of 17 patients with prior natalizumab treatment were switched to a DMT with cladribine because of a John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibody index above 1.5 (N = 13), ongoing disease activity (N = 6), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity (N = 4), or patients preference (N = 2). A chart review and follow up of those patients was performed. In addition to MRI and laboratory data, clinical data regarding MS relapses and disease progression or possible adverse events were analyzed.


Results
The median duration of cladribine treatment between February 2018 and April 2019 amounted to 9.7 months (range: 1.5-15 months). None of our 17 patients presented with a clinical relapse. Only two patients showed a new T2 lesion on brain MRI, but without any signs of PML. As expected, reduction of lymphocyte count was frequent in cladribine-treated patients, but only four patients exhibited lymphopenia grade 2 (500-800/µl).


Conclusions
In our cohort the switch from natalizumab to cladribine treatment was effective and safe. So far, no serious adverse events other than lymphopenia have been observed, especially no cases of PML.",Thomas Skripuletz;Kurt-Wolfram Sühs;Sylvia Menck;Elke Voß;Martin Stangel

There are few treatment options for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with advanced disability [expanded disability status scale (EDSS) ⩾ 6.0]. In 2010, we reported initial results of using intrathecal methotrexate (ITMTX) in patients with progressive MS. We now report on long-term use of ITMTX. We performed a retrospective chart analysis of patients who have had 18 or more treatments to establish the ongoing safety and tolerability of ITMTX. Thus, the objective of this study was to establish the safety and tolerability of long-term therapy with (ITMTX) in patients with treatment-resistant, progressive forms of MS.


Methods
We studied 83 patients (67 secondary and 16 primary progressive) who received ITMTX 12.5 mg every 8-11 weeks for 3-10 years (range: 18-57 treatments). All patients were evaluated neurologically, and their EDSS was assessed at every treatment. In addition, all adverse events, frequency of infections, and any hospitalizations, were noted.


Results
There were no deaths, hospitalizations, or other serious adverse effects related to ITMTX. Headaches occurred at least once in 12% of patients, and transient fatigue occurred in 53% of patients. As determined by EDSS, there was no significant change from baseline status to post-treatment scores in both primary progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS) patients.


Conclusions
Pulsed ITMTX was well tolerated for up to 10 years in PPMS patients with no serious adverse effects. Although this was an open-label, retrospective analysis, and efficacy could not be studied, there was evidence of disease stabilization in many patients receiving ITMTX. It appears that long-term ITMTX is a safe therapeutic option in advanced progressive MS.",Lena Josephs;Deirdre Dulak;Madison Clague;Saud A Sadiq

Because less-invasive techniques can obviate the need for brain biopsy in the diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), it is common practice to wait for a thorough initial work-up, which may delay treatment. We conducted a systematic review and reviewed our own series of patients to define the role of LP and early brain biopsy in the diagnosis of PCNSL.


Methods
Our study was divided into 2 main sections: 1) systematic review assessing the sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis on the diagnosis of PCNSL, and 2) a retrospective, single-center patient series assessing the diagnostic accuracy and safety of early biopsy in immunocompetent PCNSL patients treated at our institution from 2012 to 2018.


Results
Our systematic review identified 1481 patients with PCNSL. A preoperative LP obviated surgery in 7.4% of cases. Brain biopsy was the preferred method of diagnosis in 95% of patients followed by CSF (3.1%). In our institutional series, brain biopsy was diagnostic in 92.3% of cases (24/26) with 2 cases that required a second procedure for diagnosis. Perioperative morbidity was noted in 7.6% of cases (n = 2) due to hemorrhages after stereotactic brain biopsy that improved at follow-up.


Conclusions
The diagnostic yield of CSF analyses for PCNSL in immunocompetent patients remains exceedingly low. Our institutional series demonstrates that early biopsy for PCNSL is safe and accurate, and may avert protracted work-ups. We conclude that performing an early brain biopsy in a suspected case of PCNSL is a valid, safe option to minimize diagnostic delay.",Ashish H Shah;Claudio Cavallo;Daniel G Eichberg;Christopher A Sarkiss;Ronald Benveniste;Michael E Ivan;Ricardo J Komotar

Recurrent high-grade gliomas in adults remain a deadly cancer with median survival of less than 1 year. In the absence of effective agents, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has been adopted as a potentially beneficial next step for recurrences with hypermutated or mismatch repair-mutated phenotypes. The rationale for their use, however, is based on case reports and studies with other types of cancer.


Methods
We reviewed 4 cases of hypermutated or mismatch repair-mutated recurrent high-grade gliomas treated with checkpoint inhibitors.


Results
All cases had recurrent high-grade glioma that harbored either a hypermutated phenotype and/or a mismatch repair mutation. Treatment with checkpoint inhibitor therapy resulted in no significant response.


Conclusions
In our experience, hypermutated or mismatch repair-mutated high-grade gliomas in adults do not respond to checkpoint inhibitors alone. This lack of efficacy is in agreement with underwhelming results of clinical trials examining checkpoint inhibitors in high-grade gliomas. The case reports of responders have been in pediatric patients with glioma and are likely a different subtype altogether.",Camilo E Fadul;David Schiff;Benjamin Purow

1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) facilitates noninvasive diagnosis of pediatric brain tumors by providing metabolite profiles. Prospective studies of diagnostic accuracy and comparisons with conventional MRI are lacking. We aimed to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of MRS for childhood brain tumors and determine added clinical value compared with conventional MRI.


Methods
Children presenting to a tertiary pediatric center with brain lesions from December 2015 through 2017 were included. MRI and single-voxel MRS were acquired on 52 tumors and sequentially interpreted by 3 radiologists, blinded to histopathology. Proportions of correct diagnoses and interrater agreement at each stage were compared. Cases were reviewed to determine added value of qualitative radiological review of MRS through increased certainty of correct diagnosis, reduced number of differentials, or diagnosis following spectroscopist evaluation. Final diagnosis was agreed by the tumor board at study end.


Results
Radiologists' principal MRI diagnosis was correct in 69%, increasing to 77% with MRS. MRI + MRS resulted in significantly more additional correct diagnoses than MRI alone (P = .035). There was a significant increase in interrater agreement when correct with MRS (P = .046). Added value following radiologist interpretation of MRS occurred in 73% of cases, increasing to 83% with additional spectroscopist review. First histopathological diagnosis was available a median of 9.5 days following imaging, with 25% of all patients managed without conclusive histopathology.


Conclusions
MRS can improve the accuracy of noninvasive diagnosis of pediatric brain tumors and add value in the diagnostic pathway. Incorporation into practice has the potential to facilitate early diagnosis, guide treatment planning, and improve patient care.",Simrandip K Gill;Lesley MacPherson;Adam Oates;Benjamin Pinkey;Paul Davies;Niloufar Zarinabad;Nigel P Davies;Ben Babourina-Brooks;Martin Wilson;Andrew C Peet

The number of incidental meningiomas has increased because of the increased availability of neuroimaging. Lack of prospective data on the natural history makes the optimal management unclear. We conducted a 5-year prospective study of incidental meningiomas to identify risk factors for tumor growth.


Methods
Sixty-four of 70 consecutive patients with incidental meningioma were included. Clinical and radiological status was obtained at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. GammaPlan and mixed linear regression modeling were utilized for volumetric analysis with primary endpoint tumor growth.


Results
None of the patients developed tumor-related symptoms during the study period, although 48 (75%) tumors increased (>15%), 13 (20.3%) remained unchanged, and 3 (4.7%) decreased (>15%) in volume. Mean time to growth was 2.2 years (range, 0.5-5.0 years).The growth pattern was quasi-exponential in 26%, linear in 17%, sigmoidal in 35%, parabolic in 17%, and continuous reduction in 5%. There was significant correlation among growth rate, larger baseline tumor volume (P < .001), and age in years (<55 y: 0.10 cm3/y, 55-75 y: 0.24 cm3/y, and >75 y: 0.85 cm3/y).


Conclusion
The majority of meningiomas will eventually grow. However, more than 60% display a self-limiting growth pattern. Our study provides level-2 evidence that asymptomatic tumors can be safely managed utilizing serial imaging until persistent radiological and/or symptomatic growth.",Geir Olve Skeie;Geir Egil Eide;Annbjørg Hausken;Morten Lund-Johansen;Bente Sandvei Skeie

GBM (WHO Grade IV; N = 2073) and non-GBM (WHO Grades II and III; N = 2963) were defined using the histology grouping of the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States. Non-GBM was divided into oligodendrogliomas/mixed gliomas and astrocytomas. Sex differences in survival were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for known prognostic variables.


Results
There was a female survival advantage in patients with GBM both in the unadjusted (P = .048) and adjusted (P = .003) models. Unadjusted, median survival was 20.1 months (95% CI: 18.7-21.3 months) for women and 17.8 months (95% CI: 16.9-18.7 months) for men. Adjusted, median survival was 20.4 months (95% CI: 18.9-21.6 months) for women and 17.5 months (95% CI: 16.7-18.3 months) for men. When stratifying by age group (18-55 vs 56+ years at diagnosis), this female survival advantage appeared only in the older group, adjusting for covariates (P = .017). Women (44.1%) had a higher proportion of methylated MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) than men (38.4%). No sex differences were found for non-GBM.


Conclusions
Using the NCDB data, there was a statistically significant female survival advantage in GBM, but not in non-GBM.",Quinn T Ostrom;L C Stetson;Kristin Waite;Tiffany R Hodges;Christina H Wright;James Wright;Joshua B Rubin;Michael E Berens;Justin Lathia;James R Connor;Carol Kruchko;Andrew E Sloan;Jill S Barnholtz-Sloan
847,Emma van Kessel,"Background
Impairments in neurocognitive functioning (NCF) frequently occur in glioma patients. Both the tumor and its treatment contribute to these impairments. We aimed to quantify NCF in glioma patients before treatment and to investigate which factors influence NCF.


Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study in diffuse glioma patients according to STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) criteria. All patients had undergone neuropsychological assessment as part of routine clinical care, before awake surgery. We studied ""overall NCF"" and NCF in 5 neurocognitive domains separately. For ""overall NCF"" and per domain, we performed analyses at 2 different levels of outcome measures: (1) group level: mean cognitive functioning of the study sample, and (2) individual level: the percentage of impaired patients. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to investigate which factors were associated with the occurrence of cognitive impairments.


Results
From our cohort of glioma patients (2010-2016), 168 patients met all the inclusion criteria. All cognitive domains were significantly affected at the group level. The percentages of neurocognitive impairments (-2SD) were highest for Executive Functioning, Psychomotor Speed, and Memory (26.5%, 23.2%, and 19.3%, respectively). Patients with high-grade glioma were affected more severely than patients with low-grade glioma. Tumor volume, isocitrate dehydrogenase status, WHO grade, and histology were associated with the occurrence of domain-specific impairments.


Conclusions
Cognitive impairment occurs in the majority of treatment-naive glioma patients. The domains Executive Functioning, Speed, and Memory are involved most frequently. These impairments in NCF are explained not only by tumor location and volume, but also by other (biological) mechanisms.",Michelle A C Emons;Irene H Wajer;Kirsten M van Baarsen;Marike L Broekman;Pierre A Robe;Tom J Snijders;Martine J E Van Zandvoort
848,H Ian Robins,"Background
Fearing increased myelotoxicity, many practitioners adjust the body surface area (BSA)-calculated doses in obese patients. Regarding temozolomide (TMZ), a prior study suggested men with a BSA >2 m2 may experience increased toxicity; however, surprisingly, the inverse observation was noted in women, ie, BSA <2 m2 was associated with higher toxicity. To further clarify this issue, data derived from a large clinical trial were analyzed.


Methods
The incidence of grade 3 and 4 myelotoxicity in a newly diagnosed glioblastoma phase 3 trial (RTOG 0525) was statistically correlated with BMI and separately with BSA. All patients received radiation and TMZ followed by adjuvant standard dose TMZ vs dose-dense TMZ; dosing regimen-associated myelotoxicity and BMI/BSA were analyzed separately. Obesity was defined as a BMI ≥30.


Results
There was no statistically significant correlation between gender and BSA and the occurrence of myotoxicities. For the standard arm, surprisingly the incidence of grade 3/4 myotoxicities in patients with a BMI <30 was significantly higher than in patients with a BMI ≥30 (12% vs 1%, odds ratio [OR] 12.5, P < .001). There was no significant difference between obese and nonobese patients (BMI ""cut-point"" of 30) in the dose-dense arm (OR = 0.9, 95% confidence interval: 0.4-1.6). The grade hematological 3/4 toxicity rate was significantly higher in women vs men (14% vs 8%) P = .009 in spite of the lack of association between gender and BSA or BMI.


Conclusion
TMZ dosing based on actual BSA is recommended with the caveat that woman are likely at higher toxicity risk.",Jens Eickhoff;Mark R Gilbert;Terri S Armstrong;Wenyin Shi;John F De Groot;Christopher J Schultz;Grant K Hunter;Egils Valeinis;Mack Roach;Emad F Youssef;Luis Souhami;Steve P Howard;Frank S Lieberman;James G Herman;Peixin Zhang;Minesh P Mehta
849,Vijay M Patil,"Background
In our previous experience, a significant proportion of patients who received 5-HT3 antagonist monotherapy with adjuvant temozolomide (150-200 mg/m2) had chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). This is an audit comparing the multiple antiemetic therapies in the prevention of temozolomide-associated CINV.


Methods
This was a retrospective audit. Adult glioma patients treated with temozolomide at a dose of 150-200 mg/m2 between October 2017 and June 2018 were selected for this analysis. Three antiemetic prophylaxis were used in this time period: ondansetron (October 2017 to November 2017), ondansetron + domperidone (December 2017 to February 2018), and ondansetron + olanzapine (March 2018 to June 2018). The rates of nausea and vomiting were compared among the 3 cohorts using the chi-squared test with Bonferroni correction. A P value of less than .016 was considered significant.


Results
A total of 360 patients were selected for this analysis. There were 91 patients in the ondansetron prophylaxis group (25.3%), 113 (31.4%) in the ondansetron plus domperidone group, and 156 (43.3%) in the ondansetron plus olanzapine group. The overall incidence of nausea and vomiting was 25.0% (n = 90) and 7.2% (n = 26). Overall the rates of nausea (P = .052) and vomiting (P = .481) were similar in all 3 cohorts. However, the rates of grade 2 and above nausea (P = .012) and vomiting (P = .015) were significantly lower in the olanzapine group.


Conclusion
The combination of ondansetron with olanzapine leads to a statistically significant decrease in the rate of moderate-to-severe emesis and nausea and needs to be explored in a prospective study.",Arun Chandrasekharan;Dilip Harindran Vallathol;Mridul Malhotra;Ram Abhinav;Priti Agarwal;Anu Rajpurohit;Raees Tonse;Atanu Bhattacharjee;Rakesh Jalali
850,Cristina Valencia-Sanchez,"Background
Guidelines to provide recommendations about driving restrictions for patients with brain metastases are lacking. We aim to determine whether clinical neurologic examination is sufficient to predict suitability to drive in these patients by comparison with an occupational therapy driving assessment (OTDA).


Methods
We prospectively evaluated the concordance between neurology assessment of suitability to drive (pass/fail) and OTDA in 41 individuals with brain metastases. Neuro-oncology evaluation included an interview and neurological examination. Participants subsequently underwent OTDA during which a battery of objective measures of visual, cognitive, and motor skills related to driving was administered.


Results
The mean age of patients who failed OTDA was age 68.9 years vs 59.3 years in the group members who passed (P = .0046). The sensitivity of the neurology assessment to predict driving fitness compared with OTDA was 16.1% and the specificity 90%. The 31 patients who failed OTDA were more likely to fail Vision Coach, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Trail Making B tests.


Conclusions
There was poor association between the assessment of suitability to drive by neurologists and the outcome of the OTDA in patients with brain metastases. Subtle deficits that may impair the ability to drive safely may not be evident on neurologic examination. The positive predictive value was high to predict OTDA failure. Age could be a factor affecting OTDA performance. The results raise questions about the choice of assessments in making recommendations about driving fitness in people with brain metastases. OTDA should be strongly considered in patients with brain metastases who wish to continue driving.",Vanessa C Gorelkin;Maciej M Mrugala;Akanksha Sharma;Sujay A Vora;Jonathan B Ashman;Thomas B Daniels;Michele Y Halyard;William G Rule;Nan Zhang;Richard J Butterfield;Steven E Schild;Alyx B Porter
851,Eduardo Estevis,"Background
Operating a motor vehicle involves multiple cognitive and sensorimotor faculties. Neurological conditions pose driving risk, but this has not been examined in patients with primary brain tumors.


Methods
Sixty-four patients with primary brain tumors (32 left hemisphere; 69% glioblastoma) completed the Cognitive Behavioral Driver's Inventory (CBDI). A subset also completed broader cognitive testing. Patient characteristics, CBDI measures, and broader neuropsychological test scores were compared between Passing and Nonpassing groups. Follow-up logistic regression analyses identified patient characteristics and CBDI measures predictive of Pass/Nonpass outcome. Point-biserial correlations determined associations between neuropsychological tests and CBDI outcome.


Results
Sixty-nine percent of patients were classified as passing the CBDI. Nonpassing patients were older and more likely to have WHO grade IV and temporal lobe tumors. Age was the most salient predictor of CBDI performance. CBDI measures of speeded visual search and set-shifting, speeded response inhibition, vigilance and freedom from distractibility, and basic visual scanning speed were predictive of Pass/Nonpass outcome. Neuropsychological tests of memory in particular, but also speeded visual scanning and discrimination, executive function, basic visual attention, visuoconstruction, and manual dexterity (dominant hand), were associated with CBDI outcome.


Conclusions
A sizeable proportion of patients with primary brain tumors appear at risk of driving difficulty, particularly those with higher-grade tumors and of older age. Memory, visual attention, and executive difficulties appear to contribute most to driving safety risk as determined by the CBDI. These results highlight the importance of driving safety screening in this population.",Kyle R Noll;Mariana E Bradshaw;Jeffrey S Wefel
852,Megan S Jeon,"Background
The literature describing the incidence of sleep difficulty in CNS cancers is very limited, with exploration of a sleep difficulty symptom trajectory particularly sparse in people with advanced disease. We aimed to establish the prevalence and longitudinal trajectory of sleep difficulty in populations with CNS cancers receiving palliative care nationally, and to identify clinically modifiable predictors of sleep difficulty.


Methods
A consecutive cohort of 2406 patients with CNS cancers receiving palliative care from sites participating in the Australian national Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration were evaluated longitudinally on patient-reported sleep difficulty from point-of-care data collection, comorbid symptoms, and clinician-rated problems. Multilevel models were used to analyze patient-reported sleep difficulty.


Results
Reporting of mild to severe sleep difficulties ranged from 10% to 43%. Sleep scores fluctuated greatly over the course of palliative care. While improvement in patients' clinical status was associated with less sleep difficulty, the relationship was not clear when patients deteriorated. Worsening of sleep difficulty was associated with higher psychological distress (P < .0001), greater breathing problems (P < .05) and pain (P < .05), and higher functional status (P < .001) at the beginning of care.


Conclusions
Sleep difficulty is prevalent but fluctuates widely in patients with CNS cancers receiving palliative care. A better-tailored sleep symptom assessment may be needed for this patient population. Early interventions targeting psychological distress, breathing symptoms, and pain for more functional patients should be explored to see whether it reduces sleep difficulties late in life.",Haryana M Dhillon;Joseph Descallar;Lawrence Lam;Samuel Allingham;Eng-Siew Koh;David C Currow;Meera R Agar
853,Mark E Whitlock,"Objective: We investigated the accuracy of the often-stated assumption that placebo nonadditivity and an increasing placebo response are major problems in clinical trials and the cause of a trend for smaller treatment effects observed in clinical trials for major depressive disorder (MDD) in recent years. Method of research: We reviewed data from 122 MDD trials conducted between the years 1983 and 2010 (analyzed originally by Undurraga and Baldessarini in 2012) to determine whether the data support the assumption of placebo additivity. Statistical techniques, such as conventional least squares regression, orthogonal least squares regression and locally weighted loess smoothing, were applied to the data set. Results: Re-analysis of the data set showed the active and placebo responses to be highly correlated, to the degree that would be expected assuming placebo additivity, when random variability in both active and placebo response is considered. Despite the placebo responses in MDD trials increasing up to approximately the year 1998, we found no evidence that it has continued to increase since this date, or that it has been the cause of smaller reported treatment effects in recent years. Conclusion: Attempts to reduce the placebo response are unlikely to increase the treatment effect since they are likely to reduce drug nonspecific effects in the treatment arm by a similar amount. Thus, it should come as no surprise that trial designs set up with the sole purpose of reducing placebo response fail to discernibly benefit our ability to identify new effective treatments.",Philip W Woodward;Robert C Alexander
854,Catherine Butz,"Objective: Conversion disorder has a significant impact on families and the healthcare system. A recent review suggests there is little uniformity in treating this population. This paper describes an inpatient treatment program emphasizing physical conditioning and less time uncovering the psychological underpinnings of the presentation. Design: This study included 100 pediatric patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation setting with lower extremity weakness/dysfunction not explained by a medical cause. Patients followed a 16-step goal hierarchy to increase physical function. Patients participated in three hours of therapy and met with a psychologist and teacher daily. Patient functioning was assessed at three time periods using the mobility items of the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM). Results: Ninety-four patients completed the program. The average length of stay was 10 days. There were no significant differences between gender, length of stay, or insurance. Data was collected from 73 participants at a two-month follow-up. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), using time points at admission, discharge, and follow-up, revealed significant improvements over time. Post-hoc contrasts showed differences with admission and discharge but no differences between discharge and follow-up, suggesting gains in mobility remained. Conclusion: This paper describes an inpatient program that effectively treats patients with conversion disorder in a relatively short period. The physical gains made during hospitalization persisted over time and suggest inpatient rehabilitation focusing on physical mobility could be a more financially beneficial approach than outpatient treatment. Future considerations include identifying a more robust assessment process for patients to determine other psychological characteristics that might impact successful, more short-term treatment.",Cindy Iske;Natalie Truba;Kristen Trott

858,Masaru Nakamura,"Psychotropic-induced hyponatremia is one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities observed in routine psychiatric practice. However, many features of hyponatremia mimic those seen in depression, which can lead to the condition being overlooked. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or apical ballooning syndrome (ABS), is a reversible cardiomyopathy that mimics acute myocardial infarction. Limited evidence has indicated that hyponatremia might have a role in the development of ABS. We present a case of female patient with bipolar disorder who developed acute hyponatremia and ABS while taking lamotrigine. After cessation of lamotrigine, a time-sequential improvement of hyponatremia and ABS was observed via repeated electrocardiogram, suggesting a relationship between hyponatremia and ABS. Due to the association between severe hyponatremia and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, this case highlights the importance of carefully monitoring serum sodium levels and ECG changes in patients on psychotropic medications during their entire course of treatment to prevent serious or fatal complications.",Takahiko Nagamine

Selecting an appropriate guiding catheter to provide both sufficient supportability for working devices and sufficient distal navigability is essential for ensuring the success of a procedure. This study aimed to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using the ENVOY 6F distal access (DA) guiding catheter in coil embolization of anterior circulation cerebral aneurysms.


Methods
We included 98 patients (72 [73.5%] women, median age: 63 [range: 25-84] years) who underwent endovascular coiling with the ENVOY 6F DA guiding catheter from May to November 2016. We analyzed data on patient demographics and the number of co-axial techniques to position the guiding catheter, initial and final location of the catheter, and complications related to the catheter.


Results
The co-axial technique was used to position the ENVOY 6F DA guiding catheter in the internal carotid artery (ICA) in 20 cases (20.41%). The initial position of the ENVOY 6F DA guiding catheter involved the cervical ICA (79.6%), horizontal petrous ICA (17.3%), and vertical petrous ICA (3.1%). Final control angiograms after endovascular coiling showed proximal change in the final, compared to the initial, position of the ENVOY 6F DA guiding catheter in 25 cases (25.51%). Procedure-related complications were observed in nine patients (9.18%), involving vasospasm in all cases; however, there was no symptomatic case.


Conclusion
The ENVOY 6F DA guiding catheter had relatively sufficient distal navigability without symptomatic procedural complications. However, the change in the catheter position after endovascular coiling denoted insufficient supportability.",Sung-Chul Jin;Sung-Tae Kim;Young Jin Heo;Ji Yeon Han;Jung Hwa Seo;Sung Hwa Paeng;Jung Soo Kim;Hae Woong Jeong;Young-Gyun Jeong
860,Taek Min Nam,"Objective
Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening neurological deficit with the highest morbidity and mortality. In recent years, neuroendoscopy has been used to treat intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs). However, the choice of neuroendoscopic surgery or craniotomy for patients with ICHs is controversial. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of neuroendoscopic surgery compared to craniotomy in patients with supratentorial hypertensive ICH.


Materials and Methods
A systematic electronic search was performed using online electronic databases such as Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane library updated on December 2017. The meta-analysis was performed by only including studies designed as randomized controlled trials.


Results
Three randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis of death showed that neuroendoscopic surgery decreased the rate of death compared to craniotomy (RR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.26-1.29; P=0.18). Pooled results of complications showed that neuroendoscopic surgery tended to have fewer complications than craniotomy had (RR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.28-0.49; P < 0.0001).


Conclusion
Although the presenting analyses suggest that neuroendoscopic surgery should have fewer complications than craniotomy dose, it had no superior advantage in morbidity rate definitely. Therefore, it may be necessary for the neurosurgeons to select best optimal patients for individual treatment.",Young Zoon Kim

The spot sign on computed tomography angiography is little known about the relationship between the spot sign and the results of cerebral angiography We retrospectively analyzed the spot sign, digital subtraction angiography results, and other factors.


Material and Methods
From December 2009 to May 2014, DSA was performed in 52 ICH patients with non-specific location or abnormalities on CTA findings. 26 of those patients, whose initial CTA showed the spot sign, were analyzed. Two groups, one with the spot sign in the ventricle (Group A) and others with the spot sign in another location (Group B) were statistically compared.


Results
The mean age of the study subjects was 46.9 years (range, 15 to 80 years) and the percentage of males was 53.8%. Thirteen of 26 patients had ICH without intraventricular hemorrhage, and 6 patients had co-existing IVH. In 17 cases, the DSA results were negative. Seven patients were diagnosed with pseudoaneurysms, and two cases showed developmental venous anomalies. Group A consisted of the 8 patients (30.8%) who showed the spot sign in a ventricle. The number of pseudoaneurysms was statistically significantly higher in Group A than in Group B (71.4% versus 28.6%; OR, 13.3; 95% CI, 1.7-103.8 P = 0.014). All three patients who underwent endovascular treatment were members of Group A (P = 0.022), whereas most (92.3%) of those in Group B underwent surgical evacuation. (P = 0.030).

864,Amy F T Arnsten,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates higher cognition but is impaired by stress exposure when high levels of catecholamines activate calcium-cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. The current study examined whether stress and increased cAMP-PKA signaling in rat medial PFC (mPFC) reduce pyramidal cell firing and impair working memory by activating KCNQ potassium channels. KCNQ2 channels were found in mPFC layers II/III and V pyramidal cells, and patch-clamp recordings demonstrated KCNQ currents that were increased by forskolin or by chronic stress exposure, and which were associated with reduced neuronal firing. Low dose of KCNQ blockers infused into rat mPFC improved cognitive performance and prevented acute pharmacological stress-induced deficits. Systemic administration of low doses of KCNQ blocker also improved performance in young and aged rats, but higher doses impaired performance and occasionally induced seizures. Taken together, these data demonstrate that KCNQ channels have powerful influences on mPFC neuronal firing and cognitive function, contributing to stress-induced PFC dysfunction.",Lu E Jin;Nao J Gamo;Brian Ramos;Constantinos D Paspalas;Yury M Morozov;Anna Kata;Nigel S Bamford;Mark F Yeckel;Leonard K Kaczmarek;Lynda El-Hassar
865,Lívia Maria Bolsoni,"Reconsolidation is the return of a memory to a transient state of lability, following memory consolidation, that can occur when memories are evoked. During the process of reconsolidation, memories may be modified by different means, including the administration of drugs, during a period called the ""reconsolidation window"". This process has been widely studied in animals, but human studies are limited and include several methodological pitfalls. Our objective was to conducte a systematic review of the literature that utilizes pharmacological interventions during the process of reconsolidation of aversive memories in humans, with a critical analysis of the methodologies used. Searches were made in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and SciELO using the following search terms: (memory) AND (consolidation OR reconsolidation) AND (pharmacological manipulation OR pharmacological intervention). We found 294 references and ten (3.4%) were included in the review, based on preestablished eligibility criteria. All studies were randomized, double-blind clinical trials. The most commonly studied drug was propranolol. Two studies used a protocol involving autobiographical aversive memories, while in the remaining aversive memories were produced in the laboratory. The timing of pharmacological interventions is a controversial issue in the field, as drug activity must occur within the reconsolidation window. The small number of studies and some methodological difficulties of this type of research highlights the need for studies that individually evaluate some of the issues discussed, particularly the timing of pharmacological interventions and the duration of reconsolidation windows.",Antonio Waldo Zuardi
866,Jingjing Chang,"The hippocampus is a core brain region that responds to stress. Previous studies have found a dysconnectivity between hippocampus and other brain regions under acute and chronic stress. However, whether and how acute social stress influences the directed connectivity patterns from and to the hippocampus remains unclear. In this study, using a within-subject design and Granger causal analysis (GCA), we investigated the alterations of resting state effective connectivity from and to hippocampal subregions after an acute social stressor (the Trier Social Stress Test). Participants were engaged in stress and control conditions spaced approximately one month apart. Our findings showed that stress altered the information flows in the thalamus-hippocampus-insula/midbrain circuit. The changes in this circuit could also predict with high accuracy the stress and control conditions at the subject level. These hippocampus-related brain networks have been documented to be involved in emotional information processing and storage, as well as habitual responses. We speculate that alterations of the effective connectivity between these brain regions may be associated with the registering and encoding of threatening stimuli under stress. Our investigation of hippocampal functional connectivity at a subregional level may help elucidate the functional neurobiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders.",Rongjun Yu
867,Jeffrey Parrilla Carrero,"The amygdala plays an important role in the responses to predator threat. Glutamatergic processes in amygdala regulate the behavioral responses to predator stress, and we have found that exposure to ferret odor activates glutamatergic neurons of the basolateral amygdala [BLA] which are known to project to the central amygdala [CeA]. Therefore, we tested if predator stress would increase glutamate release in the rat CeA using in vivo microdialysis, while monitoring behavioral responses during a 1 h exposure to ferret odor. Since injections of mu opioid receptor [MOR] agonists and antagonists into the CeA modulate behavioral responses to predator odor, we locally infused the MOR agonist DAMGO or the MOR antagonist CTAP into the CeA during predator stress to examine effects on glutamate efflux and behavior. We found that ferret odor exposure increased glutamate, but not GABA, efflux in the CeA, and this effect was attenuated by tetrodotoxin. Interestingly, increases in glutamate efflux elicited by ferret odor exposure were blocked by infusion of CTAP, but CTAP did not alter the behavioral responses during predator stress. DAMGO alone enhanced glutamate efflux, but did not modulate glutamate efflux during predator stress. These studies demonstrate that ferret odor exposure, like other stressors, enhances glutamate efflux in the CeA. Further, they suggest that activation of MOR in the CeA may help shape the defensive response to predator odor and other threats.",Kris F Kaigler;George H Hartshorn;Jim R Fadel;Marlene A Wilson

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a well-established surgical therapy for patients with Parkinson disease (PD).


OBJECTIVE
To define the role of adjacent white matter stimulation in the effectiveness of STN-DBS.


METHODS
We retrospectively evaluated 43 patients with PD who received bilateral STN-DBS. The volumes of activated tissue were analyzed to obtain significant stimulation clusters predictive of 4 clinical outcomes: improvements in bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and reduction of dopaminergic medication. Tractography of the nigrofugal and pallidofugal pathways was performed. The significant clusters were used to calculate the involvement of the nigrofugal and pallidofugal pathways and the STN.


RESULTS
The clusters predictive of rigidity and tremor improvement were dorsal to the STN with most of the clusters outside of the STN. These clusters preferentially involved the pallidofugal pathways. The cluster predictive of bradykinesia improvement was located in the central part of the STN with an extension outside of the STN. The cluster predictive of dopaminergic medication reduction was located ventrolateral and caudal to the STN. These clusters preferentially involved the nigrofugal pathways.


CONCLUSION
Improvements in rigidity and tremor mainly involved the pallidofugal pathways dorsal to the STN. Improvement in bradykinesia mainly involved the central part of the STN and the nigrofugal pathways ventrolateral to the STN. Maximal reduction in dopaminergic medication following STN-DBS was associated with an exclusive involvement of the nigrofugal pathways.",Christopher R Honey

To distinguish performance in a virtual reality-simulated anterior cervical discectomy scenario, uncover novel performance metrics, and gain insight into the relative importance of each metric using artificial neural networks.


METHODS
Twenty-one participants performed a simulated anterior cervical discectomy on the novel virtual reality Sim-Ortho simulator. Participants were divided into 3 groups, including 9 post-resident, 5 senior, and 7 junior participants. This study focused on the discectomy portion of the task. Data were recorded and manipulated to calculate metrics of performance for each participant. Neural networks were trained and tested and the relative importance of each metric was calculated.


RESULTS
A total of 369 metrics spanning 4 categories (safety, efficiency, motion, and cognition) were generated. An artificial neural network was trained on 16 selected metrics and tested, achieving a training accuracy of 100% and a testing accuracy of 83.3%. Network analysis identified safety metrics, including the number of contacts on spinal dura, as highly important.


CONCLUSION
Artificial neural networks classified 3 groups of participants based on expertise allowing insight into the relative importance of specific metrics of performance. This novel methodology aids in the understanding of which components of surgical performance predominantly contribute to expertise.",Vincent Bissonnette;Nicole Ledwos;Alexander Winkler-Schwartz;Recai Yilmaz;Bekir Karlik;Rolando F Del Maestro
871,C Michael Honey,"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE
Hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm (HeLPS) has been recently described but is not yet widely recognized. Patients describe intermittent coughing and choking and can be cured following microvascular decompression of their Xth cranial nerve. This case report and literature review highlight that HeLPS can co-occur with glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GN) and has been previously described (but not recognized) in the neurosurgical literature.


CLINICAL PRESENTATION
A patient with GN and additional symptoms compatible with HeLPS is presented. The patient reported left-sided, intermittent, swallow-induced, severe electrical pain radiating from her ear to her throat (GN). She also reported intermittent severe coughing, throat contractions causing a sense of suffocation, and dysphonia (HeLPS). All her symptoms resolved following a left microvascular decompression of a loop of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery that was pulsating against both the IXth and Xth cranial nerves. A review of the senior author's database revealed another patient with this combination of symptoms. An international literature review found 27 patients have been previously described with symptoms of GN and the additional (but not recognized at the time) symptoms of HeLPS.


CONCLUSION
This review highlights that patients with symptoms compatible with HeLPS have been reported since 1926 in at least 4 languages. This additional evidence supports the growing recognition that HeLPS is another neurovascular compression syndrome. Patients with HeLPS continue to be misdiagnosed as conversion disorder. The increased recognition of this new medical condition will require neurosurgical treatment and should alleviate the suffering of these patients.",Marie T Krüger;Alan R Rheaume;Josue M Avecillas-Chasin;Murray D Morrison;Christopher R Honey
872,Shlomit Yust-Katz,"BACKGROUND
Professional burnout is a syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and loss of personal achievement. Burnout is a significant issue among health care providers, and neuro-oncology providers may be at high risk. We conducted a survey to evaluate burnout and career satisfaction among those caring for patients with brain tumors, and to identify risk factors for burnout.


METHODS
We distributed an anonymous online survey to Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) members in 2016 and to European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) members in 2017. The survey was comprised of personal and professional characteristics questions and the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) questionnaire. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analyses, and incorporation of recently defined burnout profiles.


RESULTS
Sixty-three percent of SNO and 61% of EANO participants were identified as having high burnout according to MBI-HSS. Among SNO participants, physicians had a lower rate of high burnout (61%) compared to allied health professionals (68%, p<0.01) and basic scientists (83%, p<0.01). Regarding the factors most commonly contributing to high burnout, SNO participants most commonly experienced high emotional exhaustion (48% of SNO participants vs 34% of EANO participants), whereas EANO participants most commonly experienced low personal achievement (40% vs 28%). Among both SNO and EANO participants, increasing job satisfaction reduced the likelihood of high burnout.


CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of burnout among neuro-oncology professionals is high and personal risk factors were identified. Burnout profiles recognize a continuum of well-being and warrant further research.",Barbara O'Brien;Elizabeth Vera;Alvina Acquaye;Michael Weller;Terri Armstrong
873,Mina M Gerges,"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE
Brainstem lesions are challenging to manage, and surgical options have been controversial. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used for local control, but life-threatening toxicities from 0% to 9.5% have been reported. Several microsurgical approaches involving safe entry zones have been developed to optimize the exposure and minimize complications in different portions of the brainstem, but require extensive drilling and manipulation of neurovascular structures. With recent advancements, the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) can provide direct visualization of ventral brainstem. No case has been reported of EEA to remove a brainstem metastasis.


CLINICAL PRESENTATION
We present an illustrative case of a 68-yr-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented with 2.8 × 2.7 × 2.1 cm (7.9 cm3) heterogeneously enhancing, right ventral pontine lesion with extensive edema. She underwent endoscopic endonasal transclival approach, and gross total resection of the lesion was achieved.


CONCLUSION
The endoscopic approach may offer certain advantages for removal of ventral brainstem lesions, as it can provide direct visualization of important neurovascular structures, especially, if the lesion displaces the tracts and comes superficial to the pial surface.",Saniya S Godil;Ashutosh Kacker;Theodore H Schwartz

While consistently recommended, the significance of early ambulation after surgery has not been definitively studied.


OBJECTIVE
To identify the relationship between ambulation on the day of surgery (postoperative day (POD)#0) and 90-d adverse events after lumbar surgery.


METHODS
The Michigan Spine Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MSSIC) is a prospective multicenter registry of spine surgery patients. As part of routine postoperative care, patients either ambulated on POD#0 or did not. The 90-d adverse events of length of stay (LOS), urinary retention (UR), urinary tract infection (UTI), ileus, readmission, surgical site infection (SSI), pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis (PE/DVT), and disposition to a rehab facility were measured.


RESULTS
A total of 23 295 lumbar surgery patients were analyzed. POD#0 ambulation was associated with decreased LOS (relative LOS 0.83, P < .001), rehab discharge (odds ratio [OR] 0.52, P < .001), 30-d (OR 0.85, P = .044) and 90-d (OR 0.86, P = .014) readmission, UR (OR 0.73, P = 10), UTI (OR 73, P = .001), and ileus (OR 0.52, P < .001) for all patients. Significant improvements in LOS, rehab discharge, readmission, UR, UTI, and ileus were observed in subset analysis of single-level decompressions (4698 pts), multilevel decompressions (4079 pts), single-level fusions (4846 pts), and multilevel fusions (4413 pts). No change in rate of SSI or DVT/PE was observed for patients who ambulated POD#0.


CONCLUSION
POD#0 ambulation is associated with a significantly decreased risk for several key adverse events after lumbar spine surgery. Decreasing the incidence of these outcomes would be associated with significant cost savings. As ambulation POD#0 is a modifiable factor in any patient's postoperative care following most spine surgery, it should be encouraged and incorporated into spine-related, enhanced-recovery-after-surgery programs.",Michael Bazydlo;Lonni Schultz;Muwaffak Abdulhak;David R Nerenz;Victor Chang;Jason M Schwalb
875,Romain Appay,"BACKGROUND
The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors stratifies isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas into 2 major groups depending on the presence or absence of 1p/19q codeletion. However, the grading system remains unchanged and it is now controversial whether it can be still applied to this updated molecular classification.


METHODS
In a large cohort of 911 high-grade IDH-mutant gliomas from the French national POLA network (including 428 IDH-mutant gliomas without 1p/19q codeletion and 483 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q codeleted), we investigated the prognostic value of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene homozygous deletion as well as WHO grading criteria (mitoses, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis). In addition, we searched for other retinoblastoma pathway gene alterations (CDK4 amplification and RB1 homozygous deletion) in a subset of patients. CDKN2A homozygous deletion was also searched in an independent series of 40 grade II IDH-mutant gliomas.


RESULTS
CDKN2A homozygous deletion was associated with dismal outcome among IDH-mutant gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion (P < 0.0001 for progression-free survival and P = 0.004 for overall survival) as well as among anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, IDH-mutant + 1p/19q codeleted (P = 0.002 for progression-free survival and P < 0.0001 for overall survival) in univariate and multivariate analysis including age, extent of surgery, adjuvant treatment, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis. In both groups, the presence of microvascular proliferation and/or necrosis remained of prognostic value only in cases lacking CDKN2A homozygous deletion. CDKN2A homozygous deletion was not recorded in grade II gliomas.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study pointed out the utmost relevance of CDKN2A homozygous deletion as an adverse prognostic factor in the 2 broad categories of IDH-mutant gliomas stratified on 1p/19q codeletion and suggests that the grading of these tumors should be refined.",Caroline Dehais;Claude-Alain Maurage;Agusti Alentorn;Catherine Carpentier;Carole Colin;François Ducray;Fabienne Escande;Ahmed Idbaih;Aurélie Kamoun;Yannick Marie;Karima Mokhtari;Emeline Tabouret;Nesrine Trabelsi;Emmanuelle Uro-Coste;Jean-Yves Delattre;Dominique Figarella-Branger; 
876,Aida de Arriba-Arnau,"There is a lack of research regarding 0.5-ms pulse width (PW) in bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and number of treatment sessions between groups receiving 0.5-ms and 1-ms PW ECT. Ninety-four patients with unipolar major depression treated with acute bilateral ECT were analysed retrospectively, grouped as consecutive patients treated with 0.5-ms PW ECT (n = 47), and age- and sex-matched patients treated with 1-ms PW ECT. Clinical and ECT data were extracted from clinical records. Symptom evaluations and global cognitive screening at baseline and post-ECT were administered by trained psychiatrists. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS-21) was rated weekly. Efficacy and number of treatment sessions were compared between groups. PW was explored as a predictor of mean decrease in HDRS and number of treatment sessions by regression models. Group characteristics did not differ at baseline. The mean decrease in HDRS in the 0.5- and 1-ms PW [25.85 (7.79) vs. 24.33 (6.99), respectively], response (95.7% vs. 97.9%), remission (87.2% vs. 80.9%) and mean number of treatment sessions [11.28 (3.85) vs. 11.34 (3.36)] were not significantly different. Episode duration and severity, and previous ECT predicted HDRS decrease. Severity at baseline and the 6th session, the dosing method and the last ECT treatment dose predicted the number of treatment sessions needed. PW was not significant in the regressions models. The results suggest that both PWs perform similarly in bilateral ECT for depression, resulting in equivalent antidepressant efficacy and number of treatment sessions needed.",Virginia Soria;Neus Salvat-Pujol;José M Menchón;Mikel Urretavizcaya
877,Claudia Corti,"PURPOSE
Effects of tumor location on cognitive performance of patients with brain tumor are controversial: some studies reported higher risks related to supratentorial locations, some to infratentorial locations, and still others did not find any differences. We aimed to address this issue by comparing school-aged children with supratentorial or infratentorial tumor with respect not only to cognitive outcomes but also to the associations between core cognitive domains and academic abilities.


METHODS
32 children with infratentorial tumor and 22 with supratentorial tumor participated in the study. To detect relationships among cognitive domains, we tested which neuropsychological variable(s) predicted academic skills, controlling for the effects of radiotherapy and time since diagnosis.


RESULTS
Radiotherapy and time since diagnosis, but not tumor location, predicted cognitive outcomes. Radiotherapy negatively influenced attention and executive functioning, as well as reading speed and arithmetic operations accuracy. Unexpectedly, longer time since diagnosis was associated with improvement in attention and reading speed. Tumor location showed an effect on the relationships between core cognitive domains and academic skills: verbal and visual-spatial memory influenced reading and mathematical performance in supratentorial patients; in infratentorial patients, an only effect of visual-spatial memory on mathematical performance was detected.


CONCLUSIONS
Tumor location seems not to influence cognitive performance, while radiotherapy constitutes a key risk factor for cognitive impairment. Attentional and reading abilities may improve over time, possibly due to the weakening of cancer care effects. Different patterns of cognitive associations seem to characterize supratentorial and infratentorial patients, probably associated with different neuroplastic reorganization processes after tumor occurrence.",Cosimo Urgesi;Maura Massimino;Lorenza Gandola;Alessandra Bardoni;Geraldina Poggi
878,Shan Lin,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited neuropathy. Although new causative and disease-associated genes have been identified for CMT2 in recent years, molecular diagnoses are still lacking for a majority of patients. We here studied a cohort of 35 CMT2 patients of Chinese descent, using whole exome sequencing to investigate gene mutations and then explored relationships among genotypes, clinical features, and mitochondrial DNA levels in blood as assessed by droplet digital PCR. We identified pathogenic variants in 57% of CMT2 patients. The most common genetic causes in the cohort were MFN2 mutations. Two patients with typical CMT phenotype and neuromyotonia were detected to harbor compound heterozygous variations in the HINT1 gene. In conclusion, our work supports that the molecular diagnostic rate of CMT2 patients can be increased via whole exome sequencing, and our data suggest that assessment of possible HINT1 mutations should be undertaken for CMT2 patients with neuromyotonia.",Liu-Qing Xu;Guo-Rong Xu;Ling-Ling Guo;Bi-Juan Lin;Wan-Jin Chen;Ning Wang;Yi Lin;Jin He
879,Hai Xue,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is a major complication after extended endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (EETSS), which is commonly used in the treatment of anterior skull base tumors. Dural suturing and graded reconstruction are promising techniques to further decrease the incidence of postoperative CSF (poCSF) leakage. The effect of continuous dural suturing in endoscopic surgery was investigated in this retrospective study. A total of 79 EETSS patients were included; the procedures were performed for subdural tumor removal by a single endoscopic neurosurgical team. Comparisons were applied between patients who did and did not undergo endoscopic dural suturing after tumor removal. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables that significantly influenced the incidence of poCSF leakage. In all, 79 adult patients developed Esposito's grade 3 intraoperative high-flow CSF leakage. Ten patients (12.7%) experienced poCSF leakage. One of the 36 patients who underwent intraoperative dural suturing developed poCSF leakage, compared with nine of 43 patients who did not undergo dural suturing (p = 0.016). Regression analysis showed that dural suturing could significantly decrease the incidence of poCSF leakage (p = 0.049, OR 0.108, 95% CI 0.013-0.899). Prophylactic lumbar drainage could also help decrease the CSF leakage rate. Dural suturing under endoscopy is a promising and effective method for application in skull base reconstruction after subdural skull base tumor removal. With future progress, lumbar drainage and even nasoseptal flap placement could be replaced in certain groups of patients undergoing EETSS.",Zhijun Yang;Jian Liu;Xingchao Wang;Zhiyong Bi;Pinan Liu

To assess the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with mild-moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and to evaluate cognitive characteristics according to the severity of OSA.


METHODS
Patients with mild-moderate AD, recruited prospectively from a cognitive impairment unit, underwent overnight polysomnography. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index > 5/h. AD severity was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination and extensive neuropsychological battery. Epworth Sleepiness Scale and APOE status were analyzed.


RESULTS
The cohort included 128 patients with a median [IQR] age of 75.0 [72.0;79.2] years and 57.8% were women. OSA was diagnosed in 116 subjects (90.6%). The distribution of mild, moderate and severe severity of OSA was 29 (22.7%), 37 (28.9%) and 50 (39.1%), respectively. Regarding sleep symptoms, the cohort showed normal values of daytime sleepiness (median EES score 5 [3, 8]), while nycturia (89.1%) and snoring (71.1%) were the most common symptoms. Participants with severe OSA included a higher proportion of older men, were associated with snoring and sedentariness. No significant differences in cognitive assessment were found between patients with and without severe OSA in any of the domains. The prevalence of APOE ε4 was not significantly different between patients with and without severe OSA.


CONCLUSION
There was a high prevalence of OSA in patients with mild-moderate AD. OSA was not associated with sleepiness or worse cognitive function. APOE ε4 was not related to the presence or severity of OSA. Further longitudinal studies will be required to evaluate whether OSA impairs cognitive evolution in AD patients.",Ivan D Benítez;Carmen Jorge;Gerard Torres;Faride Dakterzada;Olga Minguez;Raquel Huerto;Montse Pujol;Anna Carnes;Mireia Dalmases;Aurora Gibert;Ramón Farré;Manuel Sanchez de la Torres;Ferran Barbé;Gerard Piñol-Ripoll

882,Afroditi-Despina Lalou,"OBJECTIVE
Pseudotumour cerebri syndrome (PTCS including idiopathic intracranial hypertension) is characterised by the symptoms and signs of raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFp) in the absence of ventricular dilatation or an intracranial mass lesion. Its aetiology is unknown in the majority of cases but there is much evidence for impaired CSF absorption. Traditionally, sagittal sinus pressure has been considered to be independent of CSF pressure in adults. However, the discovery of stenoses of intracranial venous sinuses and introduction of venous sinus stenting has highlighted the importance of the venous drainage in PTCS. In this study, we have explored the relationship between CSFp and SSp before and during a CSF infusion test and during CSF drainage.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ten patients (9 females:1 male) with PTCS underwent infusion studies in parallel with direct retrograde cerebral venography. Both SSp and CSFp were recorded at a baseline and during CSFp elevation in a course of a CSF infusion test. The drainage of CSF after the CSF infusion was performed in 7 patients. In 5 cases, jugular venous pressure was also measured.


RESULTS
CSFp and SSp including their amplitudes correlated significantly and strongly both at baseline (R = 0.96; p = 0.001) and during infusion (R = 0.92; p = 0.0026). During drainage, this correlation was maintained until SSp reached a stable value, whereas CSFp continued to decrease.


CONCLUSIONS
In this series of ten patients with PTCS, CSFp and SSp were coupled, both at baseline and during infusion. The implications of such coupling for the calculation of CSF outflow resistance are discussed.",Marek Czosnyka;Zofia H Czosnyka;Deepa Krishnakumar;John D Pickard;Nick J Higgins
883,Yu-Ling Liu,"Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, GA), a phenolic acid, is ubiquitous in almost all parts of the plant. In the present study, a neuroinflammatory rat model using intranigral infusion of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 4 μg/μL) was employed to study the neuroprotective effect of GA which was orally administered daily. Compared with the vehicle-treated rats, systemic administration of GA (100 mg/kg) significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein (a biomarker of activated astrocytes) and ED-1 (a biomarker of activated microglia), as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, a proinflammatory enzyme) and interleukin-1β (a proinflammatory cytokine), in the LPS-infused substantia nigra (SN) of rat brain. At the same time, GA attenuated LPS-induced elevation in heme oxygenase-1 level (a redox-regulated protein) and α-synuclein aggregation (a hallmark of CNS neurodegeneration), suggesting that GA is capable of inhibiting LPS-induced oxidative stress and protein conjugation. Furthermore, GA prevented LPS-induced caspase 3 activation (a biomarker of programmed cell death) and LPS-induced increases in receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1 and RIPK-3 levels (biomarkers of necroptosis), indicating that GA inhibited LPS-induced apoptosis and necroptosis in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system of rat brain. Moreover, an in vitro study was employed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of GA on BV2 microglial cells which were subjected to LPS (1 μg/mL) treatment. Consistently, co-incubation of GA diminished LPS-induced increases in iNOS mRNA and iNOS protein expression in the treated BV-2 cells as well as NO production in the culture medium. The anti-oxidative activity of GA was evaluated using iron-induced lipid peroxidation of brain homogenates. After 3-h incubation at 37 °C, GA was more potent than glutathione and less potent than trolox in inhibiting iron-induced lipid peroxidation. Conclusively, the present study suggests that GA is anti-inflammatory via attenuating LPS-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and protein conjugation. Furthermore, GA prevented LPS-induced programmed cell deaths of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons of the rat brain, suggesting that GA may be neuroprotective by attenuating neuroinflammation in CNS neurodegenerative diseases.",Chia-Chi Hsu;Hui-Ju Huang;Chih-Jung Chang;Shu-Hui Sun;Anya Maan-Yuh Lin

The aim of this study was to describe the real-word treatment and associated healthcare resource use (HCRU) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, as stratified by different MS subtypes.


METHODS
All patients with MS continuously insured by two German statutory healthcare insurance funds from 2011 to 2015 were enrolled. These patients were categorized into four subgroups according to their MS type as follows: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS); relapsing remittent MS (RRMS); primary progressive MS (PPMS); and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Sociodemographic characteristics, treatments, and HCRU for 2015 were analyzed. Treatment cascades for treatment-naïve patients were also determined.


RESULTS
A total of 13,333 patients with MS were identified. The largest proportion of patients had RRMS (41.9%), followed by PPMS (17.1%). Mean age of the enrolled patients was 50.2 years, and 70.7% were female. Among all patients, 38.3% of those with CIS, 22.4% with PPMS, 69.6% with RRMS, and 33.9% with SPMS received a prescription of a disease-modifying immunomodulatory agent, with interferon beta-1a being the most frequently prescribed agent. Likewise, 14.5, 18.5, 19.9, and 21.5% of patients with CIS, PPMS, RRMS, and SPMS, respectively, received a flare-up treatment with glucocorticoids. MS-associated overall costs, including indirect costs for MS-associated days absent from work, were € 16,433, with costs related to MS medication (€ 8770; 53.4%) being the main driver of costs in all subgroups. MS-associated costs according to MS subtypes were € 12,427 for CIS patients, € 14,459 for PPMS patients, € 20,583 for RRMS patients, and € 17,554 for SPMS patients.


CONCLUSION
Among the four MS subtypes, RRMS patients most often received a disease-modifying immunomodulatory treatment. Consequently, healthcare costs were highest for patients with this MS subtype. Contrary to the treatment guideline, a substantial percentage of patients with CIS, RRMS, and SPMS did not receive any disease-modifying immunomodulatory treatment.",Tobias Heidler;Andreas Fuchs;Andreas Pfaff;Kathrin Ernst;Gunter Ladinek;Thomas Wilke

Despite the clinical importance of psychological factors in migraine, the relationship between personality traits, depression, and migraine has been poorly investigated.


OBJECTIVE
To delineate the personality profile distinctive for migraineurs and to explore the relationship between personality traits and depression in migraineurs compared to non-migraineurs.


METHODS
A systematic literature search was performed up to March 2019 using PsycInfo (PROQUEST), PubMed and Scopus. Sixteen primary studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.


RESULTS
The meta-analysis on the personality defined according to Psychobiological model revealed high Harm Avoidance (Hedges'g = 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01-0.60), Persistence (Hedges'g = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.01to - 0.72) and low self-directedness (Hedges'g = - 0.33; 95% CI = -0.57 to - 0.09) in migraineurs. The meta-analysis on the personality defined according to Three Factor Model revealed high neuroticism (Hedges'g = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.32-0.63) and low extraversion (Hedges'g = - 0.08; 95% CI = - 0.14 to - 0.03) in migraineurs. Meta-regression analysis revealed that neuroticism moderated the relationship between depression and migraine.


CONCLUSION
The findings evidenced that migraine is characterized by specific personality traits. Among them, neuroticism influenced the severity of depression in migraineurs, and, therefore, an early evaluation of the personality traits could allow identifying patients susceptible to develop migraine-associated psychopathological symptoms.",Chiara Baiano;Antonio Russo;Alfonsina D'Iorio;Gioacchino Tedeschi;Luigi Trojano;Gabriella Santangelo

Functional gait disorders (FGDs) are relatively common in patients presenting for evaluation of a functional movement disorder (FMD). The diagnosis and classification of FGDs is complex because patients may have a primary FGD or a FMD interfering with gait.


METHODS
We performed a detailed evaluation of clinical information and video recordings of gait in patients diagnosed with FMDs.


RESULTS
We studied a total of 153 patients with FMDs, 68% females, with a mean age at onset of 36.4 years. A primary FGD was observed in 39.2% of patients; among these patients, 13 (8.5%) had an isolated FGD (a gait disorder without other FMDs). FMDs presented in 34% of patients with otherwise normal gait. Tremor was the most common FMD appearing during gait, but dystonia was the most common FMD interfering with gait. Patients with FGD had a higher frequency of slow-hesitant gait, astasia-abasia, bouncing, wide-based gait and scissoring compared with patients with FMDs occurring during gait. Bouncing gait with knee buckling was more frequently observed in patients with isolated FGD (P = 0.017). Patients with FGDs had a trend for higher frequency of wheelchair dependency (P = 0.073) than those with FMDs interfering with gait.


CONCLUSIONS
Abnormal gait may be observed as a primary FGD or in patients with other FMDs appearing during gait; both conditions are common and may cause disability.",Marlene Alonso-Juarez;Joseph Jankovic

Diclofenac potassium for oral solution (CAMBIA®) may be an alternative for patients who would otherwise need to be seen in a healthcare setting for parenteral ketorolac. CAMBIA® is FDA-approved for the abortive treatment of migraine and has demonstrated superiority over generic diclofenac tablets with rapid migraine reduction. This study assessed for efficacy of CAMBIA® as an alternative outpatient treatment for refractory migraine to parenteral ketorolac.


METHODS
We performed an exploratory, single-center, double-blind, double-dummy randomized controlled trial comparing CAMBIA® with IM ketorolac. Participants were randomized to receive either ketorolac 60 mg IM with dummy oral solution or CAMBIA® 50 mg, together with IM injection of normal saline. The primary endpoint was headache severity, self-rated on a scale 0-3. Secondary endpoints included self-rated nausea, disability, and photo- or phonophobia, as well as presence of side effects and need for additional rescue therapy.


RESULTS
A total of 23 patients were enrolled. Ten patients received the study drug and 13 patients received IM ketorolac as the control. There were no major differences observed with respect to the primary outcome of mean headache severity at successive time points over a 24-h follow-up period. No major differences were found with respect to average disability, nausea, and photo- or phonophobia ratings. No major adverse events were reported.


CONCLUSION
In treatment of refractory migraine headache, CAMBIA® may provide similar benefits as IM ketorolac without increasing the risk of treatment failure, major bleeding, or cardiovascular events. However, larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.

888,Aitao Wang,"Bone cancer pain (BCP) is the most common type of pain in cancer patients, during which microglia cells were activated. A previous study showed BAM8-22 had the ability to alleviate BCP via inhibiting microglia activation while the mechanism was not clear. This study aims to investigate the specific mechanism of BAM8-22 inhibiting microglia activation. This study was mainly investigated in BCP mice or LPS-treated microglia BV-2 cells. The behavior tests of mice were performed at 0, 1, 2, 12, and 24 h after BAM8-22 treatment. The expression of miR-184 and CX3CR1 mRNAs was detected by quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of CX3CR1 protein and microglia activation marker, Iba-1, was measured by western blot analysis. The levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were detected by ELISA. Dual-luciferase assay was performed to verify the combination between miR-184 and CX3CR1. After BAM8-22 treatment, increased miR-184 level was observed in both BCP mice and LPS-treated BV-2 cells, with the downregulated expression of Iba-1 and inflammatory cytokines, namely the inhibition of microglia activation. The inhibition of miR-184 reversed the inhibitory effect of BAM8-22 on microglia activation. Further, in vitro studies showed that miR-184 bound to the 3'UTR of CX3CR1 and inhibited microglia activation via repressing CX3CR1 expression. What's more, the suppression of CX3CR1 expression eliminated the reversal effect of the miR-184 inhibitor on BAM8-22-induced microglia activation and decreased Iba-1 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. In BCP models, miR-184 was upregulated by BAM8-22 and the elevated level of miR-184 bound to the 3'UTR region of CX3CR1 and repressed CX3CR1 expression, thus inhibiting the microglia activation, suggesting the potential application of miR-184/CX3CR1 for BCP treatment.",Muer Tie;Dongmei Guo;Na Wu;Shanglong Yao;Limei Yan;Xingsheng Zhao
889,Guoyou Peng,"BACKGROUND
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial surface receptor that mediates the degradation disorder of amyloid β (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of TREM2 in Parkinson's disease (PD) and α-Synclein (α-Syn) degradation is largely unknown.


METHODS
In this case-control study on Chinese population, we sequenced for polymorphisms in exon 2 of the TREM2 gene in 1,292 individuals, PD cases (n = 612), healthy controls (n = 680) by Sanger sequence, and compared the distribution of allelic frequencies between the two groups by the Fisher's exact test. Additionally, we developed and used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to evaluated soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma in partial of sequenced groups (55 PD and 40 healthy controls) analyzed their relationship with total a-syn (t-a-Syn).


RESULTS
Two novel variants were detected in exon 2 of the TREM2 gene, namely, p.S81 N, p.G58D; however, these were not significantly associated with PD (612 PD and 680 healthy controls). sTREM2 in CSF was significantly upregulated in PD patients compared to healthy controls (433.1 ± 24.7 pg/mL vs. 275.2 ± 17.9 pg/mL, p < 0.0001), but not in plasma (281.7 ± 29.3 pg/mL vs. 257.8 ± 16.5 pg/mL, p = 0.805). In PD patients, sTREM2 was positively correlated with t-α-syn (r = 0.62, p = 0.0001) in CSF, but not in plasma (r = 0.02, p = 0.89).


CONCLUSIONS
Although it may not indicate that exon 2 polymorphisms of TREM2 play a role in the pathogenesis of PD in the Chinese population, our findings described above highlight the relevance of CSF sTREM2 as a promising biomarker and are extremely possible to the therapeutic target for PD in the future.",Jiewen Qiu;Hanqun Liu;Miaomiao Zhou;Shuxuan Huang;Wenyuan Guo;Yuwan Lin;Xiang Chen;Zhe Li;Guihua Li;Wenlong Zhang;Yunlong Zhang;Xingjian Li;Zhuohua Wu;Lei Wei;Xinling Yang;Xiaoqin Zhu;Mingshu Mo;Pingyi Xu
890,Una Smailovic,"Currently established and employed biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) predominantly mirror AD-associated molecular and structural brain changes. While they are necessary for identifying disease-specific neuropathology, they lack a clear and robust relationship with the clinical presentation of dementia; they can be altered in healthy individuals, while they often inadequately mirror the degree of cognitive and functional deficits in affected subjects. There is growing evidence that synaptic loss and dysfunction are early events during the trajectory of AD pathogenesis that best correlate with the clinical symptoms, suggesting measures of brain functional deficits as candidate early markers of AD. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely available and noninvasive diagnostic method that provides direct insight into brain synaptic activity in real time. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis additionally provides information on physiologically meaningful frequency components, dynamic alterations and topography of EEG signal generators, i.e. neuronal signaling. Numerous studies have shown that qEEG measures can detect disruptions in activity, topographical distribution and synchronization of neuronal (synaptic) activity such as generalized EEG slowing, reduced global synchronization and anteriorization of neuronal generators of fast-frequency resting-state EEG activity in patients along the AD continuum. Moreover, qEEG measures appear to correlate well with surrogate markers of AD neuropathology and discriminate between different types of dementia, making them promising low-cost and noninvasive markers of AD. Future large-scale longitudinal clinical studies are needed to elucidate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of qEEG measures as early functional markers of AD on an individual subject level.",Vesna Jelic

The development and refinement of ophthalmologic techniques for studying the retina in vivo have produced evidence of retinal degeneration in AD diagnosed patients.

892,Danni Li,"The development of blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology as tools for screening the general population, and as the first step in a multistep process to determine which non-demented individuals are at greatest risk of developing AD dementia, is essential. Proteins that are reflective of AD pathology, such as amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), tau proteins [total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau)], and neurofilament light chain (NfL), are detectable in the blood. However, a major challenge in measuring these blood-based proteins is that their concentrations are much lower in plasma or serum than in the cerebrospinal fluid. Single molecule array (SiMoA) is an ultrasensitive technology that can detect proteins in blood at sub-femtomolar concentrations (i.e., 10-16 M). In this review, we focus on the utility of SiMoA assays for the measurement of plasma or serum Aβ42, P-tau, T-tau, and NfL levels and discuss future directions.",Michelle M Mielke
893,Nicholas J Ashton,"The search for accessible and cost-effective biomarkers to complement current cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging biomarkers in the accurate detection of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other common neurodegenerative disorders remains a challenging task.

Saliva, however, is also a rich source of potential biomarkers for disease detection and offers several practical advantages over biofluids that are currently examined for neurodegenerative disorders. However, while this may be true for the general population, challenges in collecting saliva from an elderly population should be seriously considered. In this review, we begin by discussing how saliva is produced and how age-related conditions can modify saliva production and composition.

Biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are already included in the diagnostic work-up of symptomatic patients but markers for preclinical diagnosis and disease progression are not available. Furthermore, blood biomarkers are highly appreciated because they are minimally invasive and more accessible in primary care and in clinical studies. Mass spectrometry (MS) is an established tool for the measurement of various analytes in biological fluids such as blood. Its major strength is the high selectivity which is why it is also preferred as a reference method for immunoassays.

897,Animesh Das,"Hirayama disease is a disease of young males causing atrophy of small muscles of the affected hand and forearm. Localized autonomic dysfunction of the affected upper limb such as cold skin and excessive sweating has been described in some patients. In this study, we looked for local as well as systemic involvement of autonomic nervous system in patients with Hirayama disease. Forty-four patients with a median duration of illness of 3 years were included in the study. Assessment of symptom profile and evaluation of autonomic nervous system were done at the time of enrolment. The mean age at presentation was 21.9 (10-32) years, with a delay in seeking medical attention of around 3 (1-11) years. Localized clinical autonomic dysfunction was present in 39 (88.6%) patients, while objective generalized autonomic dysfunction was present in 33 (75%) patients. Cold skin and excessive sweating showed good correlation with the presence of objective autonomic dysfunction (P < 0.05). In three patients, sympathetic skin response (SSR) could not be recorded in one of the four limbs. Compared to controls, the SSR results in patients with Hirayama disease showed increased latency (1.64 ± 0.21 vs. 1.57 ± 0.14, P 0.04) and decreased amplitude in upper limbs (0.65 ± 0.19 vs. 0.86 ± 0.40, P 0.01).

In this study, we examined whether R18 treatment could reduce ischemic brain injury and improve functional outcome in a nonhuman primate (NHP) stroke model. A stroke was induced in male cynomolgus macaques by MCAO distal to the orbitofrontal branch of the MCA through a right pterional craniotomy, using a 5-mm titanium aneurysm clip for 90 min. R18 (1000 nmol/kg) or saline vehicle was administered intravenously 60 min after the onset of MCAO. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; perfusion-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, or T2-weighted imaging) of the brain was performed 15 min, 24 h, and 28 days post-MCAO, and neurological outcome was assessed using the NHP stroke scale (NHPSS). Experimental endpoint was 28 days post-MCAO, treatments were randomized, and all procedures were performed blinded to treatment status. R18 treatment reduced infarct lesion volume by up to 65.2% and 69.7% at 24 h and 28 days poststroke, respectively. Based on NHPSS scores, R18-treated animals displayed reduced functional deficits. This study confirms the effectiveness of R18 in reducing the severity of ischemic brain injury and improving functional outcomes after stroke in a NHP model, and provides further support for its clinical development as a stroke neuroprotective therapeutic.",Yining Chen;Kathleen A Harrison;Joseph Y Nashed;David J Blacker;Samantha M South;Ryan S Anderton;Frank L Mastaglia;Andrew Winterborn;Neville W Knuckey;Douglas J Cook
899,Yu Chen Chang,"Circadian clocks, endogenous oscillators generating daily biological rhythms, have important roles in the nervous system to control diverse cellular processes-not only in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where the master clocks reside to synchronize all circadian clocks in the body but also in other non-SCN areas. Accumulating evidence has shown relationships between circadian abnormalities (e.g., sleep disturbances and abnormal rest-activity rhythms) and disease progressions in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) disease. Although circadian abnormalities were frequently considered as consequences of disease onsets, recent studies suggest altered circadian clocks as risk factors to develop neurodegenerative diseases via altered production or clearance rates of toxic metabolites like amyloid β. In this review, we will summarize circadian clock-related pathologies in the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the central nervous system, AD and PD. Then, we will introduce the current clinical trials to rescue circadian abnormalities in AD and PD patients. Finally, a discussion about how to improve targeting circadian clocks to increase treatment efficiencies and specificities will be followed. This discussion will provide insight into circadian clocks as potential therapeutic targets to attenuate onsets and progressions of neurodegenerative diseases.",Jin Young Kim
900,Hongge Wang,"OBJECTIVE
Development of biomarkers for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is critical for implementing effective clinical trials. The most common form of CMT, type 1A, is caused by a genomic duplication surrounding the PMP22 gene. A recent report (Neurology 2018;90:e518-3524) showed elevation of neurofilament light (NfL) in plasma of CMT1A disease patients, which correlated with disease severity. However, no plasma/serum biomarker has been identified that is specific to Schwann cells, the most directly affected cells in CMT1A.


METHODS
We used the Olink immuno PCR platform to profile CMT1A patient (n = 47, 2 cohorts) and normal control plasma (n = 41, two cohorts) on five different Olink panels to screen 398 unique proteins.


RESULTS
The TMPRSS5 protein (Transmembrane protease serine 5) was elevated 2.07-fold (P = <0.0001) in two independent cohorts of CMT1A samples relative to controls. TMPRSS5 is most highly expressed in Schwann cells of peripheral nerve. Consistent with early myelination deficits in CMT1A, TMPRSS5 was not significantly correlated with disease score (CMTES-R, CMTNS-R), nerve conduction velocities (Ulnar CMAP, Ulnar MNCV), or with age. TMPRSS5 was not significantly elevated in smaller sample sets from patients with CMT2A, CMT2E, CMT1B, or CMT1X. The Olink immuno PCR assays confirmed elevated levels of NfL (average 1.58-fold, P < 0.0001), which correlated with CMT1A patient disease score.


INTERPRETATION
These data identify the first Schwann cell-specific protein that is elevated in plasma of CMT1A patients, and may provide a disease marker and a potentially treatment-responsive biomarker with good disease specificity for clinical trials.",Matthew Davison;Kathryn Wang;Tai-He Xia;Martin Kramer;Katherine Call;Jun Luo;Xingyao Wu;Riccardo Zuccarino;Chelsea Bacon;Yunhong Bai;John J Moran;Laurie Gutmann;Shawna M E Feely;Tiffany Grider;Alexander M Rossor;Mary M Reilly;John Svaren;Michael E Shy
901,François Vassal,"Purpose: To depict the specific brain networks that are modulated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson's disease (PD), using diffusion tensor imaging-based fibre tractography (DTI-FT).Materials and methods: Nine patients who received bilateral STN-DBS for PD were included. Electrodes were localized by co-registering preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and postoperative computed tomography. The volume of tissue activated (VTA) was estimated as an isotropic, spherical electric field distribution centred at each effective electrode contact's centroid coordinates, taking into account individual stimulation parameters (i.e. voltage, impedance). Brain connectivity analysis was undertaken using a deterministic DTI-FT method, seeded from a single region of interest corresponding to the VTA. The labelling of the reconstructed white matter fibre tracts relied on their path and (sub)cortical termination territories.Results: Six months after surgery, we observed a statistically significant reduction in both the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part III and L-dopa equivalent daily dose. Areas consistently connected to the VTA included the brainstem (100%), cerebellum (94%), dorsal (i.e. supplementary motor area) and lateral premotor cortex (94%), and primary motor cortex (72%). An involvement of the hyperdirect pathway (HDP) connecting the STN and the (pre)motor cortex was demonstrated.Conclusions: The connectivity patterns observed in this study suggest that the therapeutic effects of STN-DBS are mediated through the modulation of distributed, large-scale motor networks. Specifically, the depiction of projection neurons connecting the stimulated area/STN to the (pre)motor cortex, reinforce the growing evidence that the HDP might be a potential therapeutic target in PD. If further replicated, these findings could raise the possibility that DTI-FT reconstruction of the HDP may critically improve DBS targeting and stimulation parameters selection, through the development of programming tools that incorporate VTA modelling and patient-specific DTI-FT data.",Domitille Dilly;Claire Boutet;Frédérique Bertholon;David Charier;Benjamin Pommier
902,Katherine A Johnson,"A new variation of the Attention Network Task (ANT) was designed to measure the functioning of and interactions between the alerting, exogenous and endogenous visual spatial orienting, and executive control systems in young school children. Previous research has produced mixed results regarding typical functioning of the attention networks in six-year-olds; no ANT has measured the functioning of the endogenous network. This Staged ANT tested the Alerting, Exogenous, and Endogenous orienting networks in separate conditions. Two hundred and forty-seven children (average age 6 years, 103 girls) completed the task. There was no clear benefit of the alerting cue until the spatial orienting cues were introduced into the task, suggesting task complexity was needed before alerting benefits were observed. The validity effect of the exogenous cue was very strong: in contrast, the validity effect of the endogenous cue was very weak. The flanker effect was very strong. A benefit of the alerting cue was shown during both the exogenous and endogenous conditions, while a cost of the alerting cue was shown during the invalid exogenous trials. Neither the alerting nor validity effects interacted with the flanker effect. These results suggest that the alerting cue primes the exogenous and endogenous systems for the upcoming cues. Once the complexity of the task increases with the addition of the flankers, the alerting effect attenuates. The alerting and the two orienting networks interact together but the executive attention network acts independently, in children aged 6 years.",Frances C Lewis;Kim M Cornish

This project examined changes from before neuropsychological evaluation to several months afterward in parent report of their child's functioning and ability to participate across home, school, and community settings.Fifty-one parents of children and adolescents receiving their first outpatient neuropsychological evaluation completed questionnaires prior to initial parent interview and following the final report (of n = 162 who were mailed the follow-up questionnaire). Parents rated their perception of the severity of their child's problems, their child's ability to participate, and satisfaction with the child's ability to participate across school, home, and community domains. Analysis utilized MANOVA with bootstrapping to obtain standard errors and false discovery rate to control Type-1 errors. Parents reported a significant decrease in the severity of problems related to academic progress (p = .034) and overall severity of problems (p = .028) at follow-up. There was no significant change in the rated severity of the child's problems with peers or family. Parents reported significant increases in their child's ability to participate, and parent satisfaction with child participation, in school (ps<.001), at home (ps<.01), and in the community (ps<.001).Although this observational study cannot definitively show cause-and-effect, findings support the utility of pediatric neuropsychological evaluations in facilitating child functioning.

The extent of resection has been reported to be associated with overall survival in gliomas. The use of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) has been recognized to increase the extent of tumor resection.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate what factors affect the intraoperative fluorescence after administration of 5-ALA in gliomas.


METHODS
Correlation of intraoperative fluorescence and several clinical, radiographic, molecular biologic, and histopathologic characters was retrospectively evaluated in 104 patients (53 males and 51 females; mean age 54.2 yr) with gliomas at our institution. To clarify the mechanisms that mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) affect the intraoperative fluorescence, in Vitro experiments using genetically engineered glioma cells harboring mutant IDH1 were performed.


RESULTS
Intraoperative fluorescence was observed in 82 patients (78.8%). In addition to age, magnetic resonance imaging enhancement, World Health Organization grades, and MIB-1 index, the status of IDH was revealed to be correlated with intraoperative fluorescence. In Vitro assay revealed that mutant IDH indirectly reduced the amount of exogenous 5-ALA-derived protoporphyrinogen IX in glioma cells by increasing activity of ferrochelatase and heme oxygenase 1.


CONCLUSION
Mutant IDH1/2-induced metabolite changes of exogenous 5-ALA were suggested to contribute to the lesser intraoperative fluorescence in gliomas with mutant IDH1/2 than in those without.",Kazuhiro Murayama;Kiyonori Kuwahara;Eriel Sandika Pareira;Shunsuke Nakae;Yuya Nishiyama;Kazuhide Adachi;Seiji Yamada;Hikaru Sasaki;Naoki Yamamoto;Masato Abe;Joydeep Mukherjee;Mitsuhiro Hasegawa;Russell O Pieper;Yuichi Hirose

To assess test-retest reliability of the Dyskinesia Impairment Scale (DIS) in children and young adults with dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP).


METHOD
Dystonia and choreoathetosis were assessed in 15 participants with dyskinetic CP (13 males, 2 females; age range 5-22y, mean 14y, SD 4y) using the DIS in two separate sessions over 7 days. Exclusion criteria were changes in muscle relaxant medication within the previous 3 months, orthopaedic or neurosurgical interventions within the previous year, and spinal fusion. Intraclass correlation coefficient, confidence intervals (CI), standard error of measurement, and the minimal detectable difference (MDD) were determined for test-retest reliability.


RESULT
Intraclass correlation coefficients of the DIS, the dystonia subscale of the DIS, and the choreoathetosis subscale of the DIS were 0.98 (95% CI 0.94-0.99), 0.97 (95% CI 0.92-0.99), and 0.96 (95% CI 0.90-0.99). The standard error of measurement and MDD were 2.6% and 7.2%.

909,Badr Khbouz,"Estrogens exert pleiotropic effects on multiple physiological and behavioral responses. Male and female sexual behavior in rodents constitutes some of the best characterized responses activated by estrogens in adulthood and largely depend on ERα. Evidence exists that nucleus- and membrane-initiated estrogen signaling cooperate to orchestrate the activation of these behaviors both in short- and long-term. However, questions remain regarding the mechanism(s) and receptor(s) involved in the early brain programming during development to organize the circuits underlying sexually differentiated responses. Taking advantage of a mouse model harboring a mutation of the ERα palmitoylation site, which prevents membrane ERα signaling (mERα□□ERα□C451A), this study investigated the role of mERα on the expression of male and female sexual behavior and neuronal populations that differ between sexes. The results revealed no genotype effect on the expression of female sexual behavior, while male sexual behavior was significantly reduced, but not abolished, in males homozygous for the mutation. Similarly, the number of kisspeptin- (Kp-ir) and calbindin-immunoreactive (Cb-ir) neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPv) and the sexually-dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA), respectively, were not different between genotypes in females. In contrast, homozygous males showed increased numbers of Kp-ir and decreased numbers of Cb-ir neurons compared to wild-types, thus leading to an intermediate phenotype between females and wild-type males. Importantly, females neonatally treated with estrogens exhibited the same neurochemical phenotype as their corresponding genotype among males. Together, these data provide evidence that mERα is involved in the perinatal programming of the male brain.",Catherine de Bournonville;Lucas Court;Mélanie Taziaux;Rebeca Corona;Jean-François Arnal;Françoise Lenfant;Charlotte A Cornil
910,Martin Metzger,"The habenula (Hb) is a phylogenetically old epithalamic structure differentiated into two nuclear complexes, the medial (MHb) and lateral habenula (LHb). After decades of search for a great unifying function, interest in the Hb resurged when it was demonstrated that LHb plays a major role in the encoding of aversive stimuli ranging from noxious stimuli to the loss of predicted rewards. Consistent with a role as an anti-reward center, aberrant LHb activity has now been identified as a key factor in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder. Moreover, both MHb and LHb emerged as new players in the reward circuitry by primarily mediating the aversive properties of distinct drugs of abuse. Anatomically, the Hb serves as a bridge that links basal forebrain structures with monoaminergic nuclei in the mid- and hindbrain. So far, research on Hb has focused on the role of the LHb in regulating midbrain dopamine release. However, LHb/MHb are also interconnected with the dorsal (DR) and median (MnR) raphe nucleus. Hence, it is conceivable that some of the habenular functions are at least partly mediated by the complex network that links MHb/LHb with pontomesencephalic monoaminergic nuclei. Here, we summarize research about the topography and transmitter phenotype of the reciprocal connections between the LHb and ventral tegmental area-nigra complex, as well as those between the LHb and DR/MnR. Indirect MHb outputs via interpeduncular nucleus to state setting neuromodulatory networks will also be commented.

911,Anthony C Johnson,"The classification of chronic visceral pain is complex, resulting from persistent inflammation, vascular (ischemic) mechanisms, cancer, obstruction or distension, traction or compression, and combined mechanisms, as well as unexplained functional mechanisms. Despite the prevalence, treatment options for chronic visceral pain are limited. Given this unmet clinical need, the development of novel analgesic agents, with defined targets derived from preclinical studies, is urgently needed. While various animal models have played an important role in our understanding of visceral pain, our knowledge is far from complete. Due to the complexity of visceral pain, this document will focus on chronic abdominal pain, which is the major complaint in patients with disorders of the gut-brain interaction, also referred to as functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Models for IBS are faced with challenges including a complex clinical phenotype, which is comorbid with other conditions including anxiety, depression, painful bladder syndrome, and chronic pelvic pain. Based upon the multifactorial nature of IBS with complicated interactions between biological, psychological, and sociological variables, no single experimental model recapitulates all the symptoms of IBS. This position paper will contextualize chronic visceral pain using the example of IBS and focus on its pathophysiology while providing a critical review of current animal models that are most relevant, robust, and reliable in which to screen promising therapeutics to alleviate visceral pain and delineate the gaps and challenges with these models. We will also highlight, prioritize, and come to a consensus on the models with the highest face/construct validity.",Adam D Farmer;Timothy J Ness;Beverley Greenwood-Van Meerveld

The delivery technologies were: video conferencing, computer programmes, telephones, DVDs, CDs, robot-assisted devices, and personal digital assistants. Rates of refusal to participate were low (7.9-25%). Where satisfaction was reported, this was generally high. Many studies achieved high levels of adherence (up to 89.6%). This was lower for some technologies (e.g., robotic assistive devices). Where dropout occurred, this was for reasons including a decline in health as well as technical difficulties.

Evidence for continuous EEG monitoring in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is increasing. However, 24/7 access to EEG is not routinely available in most centers, and clinical management is often informed by more limited EEG resources. The experience of EEG was reviewed in a tertiary PICU where 24/7 EEG cover is unavailable.


METHODS
Retrospective EEG and clinical review of 108 PICU patients. Correlations were carried out between EEG and clinical variables including mortality. The role of EEG in clinical decision making was documented.


RESULTS
One hundred ninety-six EEGs were carried out in 108 PICU patients over 2.5 years (434 hours of recording). After exclusion of 1 outlying patient with epileptic encephalopathy, 136 EEGs (median duration, 65 minutes; range, 20 minutes to 4 hours 40 minutes) were included. Sixty-two patients (57%) were less than 12 months old. Seizures were detected in 18 of 107 patients (17%); 74% of seizures were subclinical; 72% occurred within the first 30 minutes of recording. Adverse EEG findings were associated with high mortality. Antiepileptic drug use was high in the studied population irrespective of EEG seizure detection. Prevalence of epileptiform discharges and EEG seizures diminished with increasing levels of sedation.


CONCLUSIONS
EEG provides important diagnostic information in a large proportion of PICU patients. In the absence of 24/7 EEG availability, empirical antiepileptic drug utilization is high.",Martina Healy;Gerard Curley;John C McHugh
914,Elisabeth E M Reus,"PURPOSE
The spike-wave index (SWI) is a key feature in the diagnosis of electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep. Estimating the SWI manually is time-consuming and is subject to interrater and intrarater variability. Use of automated detection software would save time. Thereby, this software will consistently detect a certain EEG phenomenon as epileptiform and is not influenced by human factors. To determine noninferiority in calculating the SWI, we compared the performance of a commercially available spike detection algorithm (P13 software, Persyst Development Corporation, San Diego, CA) with human expert consensus.


METHODS
The authors identified all prolonged EEG recordings for the diagnosis or follow-up of electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep carried out from January to December 2018 at an epilepsy tertiary referral center. The SWI during the first 10 minutes of sleep was estimated by consensus of two human experts. This was compared with the SWI calculated by the automated spike detection algorithm using the three available sensitivity settings: ""low,"" ""medium,"" and ""high."" In the software, these sensitivity settings are denoted as perception values.


RESULTS
Forty-eight EEG recordings from 44 individuals were analyzed. The SWIs estimated by human experts did not differ from the SWIs calculated by the automated spike detection algorithm in the ""low"" perception mode (P = 0.67). The SWIs calculated in the ""medium"" and ""high"" perception settings were, however, significantly higher than the human expert estimated SWIs (both P < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Automated spike detection (P13) is a useful tool in determining SWI, especially when using the ""low"" sensitivity setting. Using such automated detection tools may save time, especially when reviewing larger epochs.",Gerhard H Visser;Fieke M E Cox

Although there are many case reports on the role of ultrasonography (US) in distal ulnar nerve neuropathy (Guyon canal syndrome), there is a paucity of large series in the literature because of its rarity. During an 8-year period, 33 instances of electrodiagnostically confirmed cases underwent US imaging. These cases were analyzed to determine the role of US in uncovering the cause of distal ulnar nerve neuropathy and its contribution to further management.


METHODS
This was a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with distal ulnar nerve neuropathy based on electrodiagnostic criteria, who also had undergone US (measurement of the cross-sectional area and documentation of causes such as cysts and neuromas).


RESULTS
US showed normal ulnar nerve in 5, cysts in 10, neuromas in 2, and nonspecific enlargement in 16 patients. Surgery was performed in 15 patients, and the US findings were corroborated in those with cysts and neuromas; 1 patient had an aberrant muscle, and two had fibrous bands constricting the ulnar nerve in the Guyon canal (not detected preoperatively by US imaging).


CONCLUSIONS
US imaging detected the underlying cause of distal ulnar nerve neuropathy in a significant percentage of patients, potentially contributing to effective treatment.",
916,Kelsey Mankel,"During successful auditory perception, the human brain classifies diverse acoustic information into meaningful groupings, a process known as categorical perception (CP). Intense auditory experiences (e.g., musical training and language expertise) shape categorical representations necessary for speech identification and novel sound-to-meaning learning, but little is known concerning the role of innate auditory function in CP. Here, we tested whether listeners vary in their intrinsic abilities to categorize complex sounds and individual differences in the underlying auditory brain mechanisms. To this end, we recorded EEGs in individuals without formal music training but who differed in their inherent auditory perceptual abilities (i.e., musicality) as they rapidly categorized sounds along a speech vowel continuum. Behaviorally, individuals with naturally more adept listening skills (""musical sleepers"") showed enhanced speech categorization in the form of faster identification. At the neural level, inverse modeling parsed EEG data into different sources to evaluate the contribution of region-specific activity [i.e., auditory cortex (AC)] to categorical neural coding. We found stronger categorical processing in musical sleepers around the timeframe of P2 (~180 ms) in the right AC compared to those with poorer musical listening abilities. Our data show that listeners with naturally more adept auditory skills map sound to meaning more efficiently than their peers, which may aid novel sound learning related to language and music acquisition.",Jacob Barber;Gavin M Bidelman

Okadaic acid was dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and injected ICV 200 ng/10 μl. Vehicle control received 10 μl of aCSF ICV bilaterally. Control and okadaic acid injected rats were divided into two subgroups: treated i.p. with saline or memantine (5 mg/kg daily for 13 days starting from the day of okadaic acid injection). Rats were trained in the dual-solution plus-maze task that can be solved by using place or response strategies. The Western immunoblotting was used to determine relative amount of hippocampal receptors protein levels. Obtained data revealed that okadaic acid ICV injected rats were severely impaired at acquiring the place version of the maze accompanied by significant decline in hippocampal α7 subunit of nACh receptors protein levels. Memantine treatment can prevent okadaic acid induced impairment of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory and accompanied by modulation of the expression level of α7 subunit of nACh and NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus. Thus, our results support the presumption that α7 nACh receptors may play an important role in the cognitive enhancer effects of memantine and emphasize the role of cholinergic-glutamatergic interactions in memory.",Mariam R Chighladze;Revaz O Solomonia;Maia A Burjanadze;Manana Kandashvili;Nino C Chkhikvishvili;Gela V Beselia;Lali B Kruashvili
918,Liusong Yang,"Gliomas are the most common and lethal tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). At present, standard treatment involves chemotherapy and radiotherapy after surgery, but the prognosis for most gliomas remains poor due to tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), a microtubule-stabilizing protein, plays a critical role in many cellular processes and may correlate with the proliferation, apoptosis, and drug sensitivity of tumor cells, especially their sensitivity to microtubule-targeting drugs (MTDs). In this study, we investigated the role of MAP2 in gliomas and its relationship to the chemosensitivity of vincristine (VCR), an MTD commonly used in glioma chemotherapy. We downregulated MAP2 expression in glioma cells using RNA interference, observed the resultant changes in the biological characteristics of the cells, and tested their drug sensitivity to VCR by MTT assay. The results show downregulation of MAP2 in glioma cells significantly inhibited cell viability and migration, induced apoptosis, and increased sensitivity to VCR in vitro. Our findings suggest that MAP2 may be a useful molecular marker in MTD chemotherapy and a potential therapeutic target in gliomas.",Xiaoen Xu;Jiajun Zheng
919,Aurelio Ocaña-Fuentes,"Activation of NMDA receptors leads to nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by NO synthase (NOS) from L-arginine. Neuronal NOS colocalizes with somatostatinergic (SRIF) neurons and there is growing evidence of an interaction between NO and the cerebral SRIFergic system in several neurological diseases. Our aim was to study the effect of L-arginine on the regulation of the SRIFergic system in the frontoparietal cortex of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Intraperitoneal administration of L-arginine (150 mg/Kg), twice-daily during eight days, induced a decrease in SRIF receptor density, which was accompanied by a reduction in the capacity of SRIF to stimulate inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) accumulation and SRIF-like immunoreactivity (SRIF-LI) levels. To determine if these changes were related to L-arginine-derived NO synthesis, a NOS inhibitor, Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester was coadministered with L-arginine. Its coadministration prevented the reduction in the SRIF receptor density, accumulation of IP3 and SRIF-LI content. These findings indicate that L-arginine induces a deleterious effect on the cortical somatostatinergic system and that the inhibition of NOS could be helpful in some neurological disorders where this neurotransmitter system is affected.",Lilian Puebla-Jiménez;Emma Burgos-Ramos;Gema Muñoz-Acedo;María Del Carmen Boyano-Adánez;Vicente Barrios;Eduardo Arilla-Ferreiro
920,T George Hornby,"BACKGROUND
Individuals with acute-onset central nervous system (CNS) injury, including stroke, motor incomplete spinal cord injury, or traumatic brain injury, often experience lasting locomotor deficits, as quantified by decreases in gait speed and distance walked over a specific duration (timed distance). The goal of the present clinical practice guideline was to delineate the relative efficacy of various interventions to improve walking speed and timed distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following these specific diagnoses.


METHODS
A systematic review of the literature published between 1995 and 2016 was performed in 4 databases for randomized controlled clinical trials focused on these specific patient populations, at least 6 months postinjury and with specific outcomes of walking speed and timed distance. For all studies, specific parameters of training interventions including frequency, intensity, time, and type were detailed as possible. Recommendations were determined on the basis of the strength of the evidence and the potential harm, risks, or costs of providing a specific training paradigm, particularly when another intervention may be available and can provide greater benefit.


RESULTS
Strong evidence indicates that clinicians should offer walking training at moderate to high intensities or virtual reality-based training to ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance. In contrast, weak evidence suggests that strength training, circuit (ie, combined) training or cycling training at moderate to high intensities, and virtual reality-based balance training may improve walking speed and distance in these patient groups. Finally, strong evidence suggests that body weight-supported treadmill training, robotic-assisted training, or sitting/standing balance training without virtual reality should not be performed to improve walking speed or distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance.


DISCUSSION
The collective findings suggest that large amounts of task-specific (ie, locomotor) practice may be critical for improvements in walking function, although only at higher cardiovascular intensities or with augmented feedback to increase patient's engagement. Lower-intensity walking interventions or impairment-based training strategies demonstrated equivocal or limited efficacy.


LIMITATIONS
As walking speed and distance were primary outcomes, the research participants included in the studies walked without substantial physical assistance. This guideline may not apply to patients with limited ambulatory function, where provision of walking training may require substantial physical assistance.


SUMMARY
The guideline suggests that task-specific walking training should be performed to improve walking speed and distance in those with acute-onset CNS injury although only at higher intensities or with augmented feedback. Future studies should clarify the potential utility of specific training parameters that lead to improved walking speed and distance in these populations in both chronic and subacute stages following injury.

These recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for persons with chronic stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury to improve walking speed and distance.",Darcy S Reisman;Irene G Ward;Patricia L Scheets;Allison Miller;David Haddad;Emily J Fox;Nora E Fritz;Kelly Hawkins;Christopher E Henderson;Kathryn L Hendron;Carey L Holleran;James E Lynskey;Amber Walter; 
921,Breiffni Leavy,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
In order for people with Parkinson disease (PwPD) to benefit from neurorehabilitation research, interventions tested in research settings require assessment in real-world clinical practice. There is little evidence for whether efficacious exercise interventions for PwPD remain effective when transferred to standard clinical settings. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical effectiveness of the adapted HiBalance program on balance control and gait among PwPD.


METHODS
Participants (n = 117) with mild-moderate Parkinson disease were consecutively included into either the 10-week HiBalance group training (n = 61) or the control (n = 56) group. The main outcome was balance performance (Mini-BESTest). Secondary outcomes were comfortable gait speed (10-m Walk Test); functional mobility (Timed Up and Go [TUG] test) and dual-task interference (cognitive TUG test); physical activity level (steps per day); perceived balance confidence (Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale) and perceived walking difficulty (Walk-12G) and self-rated health (EQ-5D visual analog scale).


RESULTS
In total, 98 people completed the trial. Compared with controls, the training group showed significant improvement in balance performance (P < 0.001), gait speed (P = 0.001), and dual-task interference (P = 0.04) following the intervention. No group differences were observed for physical activity level or any patient-reported measures.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Highly challenging balance training is effective at improving balance, gait, and dual-task performance when delivered at a clinically feasible dose, in a range of rehabilitation settings, without direct involvement of the research group.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplementary Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A299).",Conran Joseph;Niklas Löfgren;Hanna Johansson;Maria Hagströmer;Erika Franzén
922,Keerthi Valluru,"HYPOTHESIS
We hypothesize patient-specific flow models to be an adequate in vitro surrogate to allow for characterization of pulsatile tinnitus (PT) that affects three to five million Americans.


BACKGROUND
PT, rhythmic sounds without an extracorporeal source that patients appreciate, can be caused by aberrant blood flow in large cerebral veins near the cochlea. To investigate the sound production mechanism, we created 3D printed flow models based on patient-specific cerebral venous anatomies.


METHODS
Magnetic resonance angiography datasets from two patients with PT were used to generate patient-specific 3D printed flow models. A flow circuit connecting the patient-specific models to a pulsatile, continuous flow pump simulating cardiac cycle was created. Sound recordings were made along the surface of the models using an electronic stethoscope. Peak-to-rms amplitude, and area under the power spectral density (PSD) curve values were computed to evaluate the sound measurements. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to statistically determine the differences in measurements between the patient-specific models.


RESULTS
In patient-1, the recordings (peak-to-rms) from the internal jugular vein stenosis of baseline model (4.29 ± 1.26 for 146 samples) were significantly louder (p < 0.001) than that of the altered model (3.29 ± 0.96 for 143 samples). In patient-2, the sound measured at the transverse sinus stenosis in the pre-lumbar puncture model (4.84 ± 1.11 for 148 samples) was significantly louder (p < 0.0001) than that of the post-lumbar puncture model (3.14 ± 0.87 for 135 samples).


CONCLUSIONS
The models are able to generate sounds very similar to those appreciated by patients and examiners in the cases of objective PT.",James Parkhill;Ayushi Gautam;Henrik Haraldsson;Evan Kao;Joseph Leach;Alexandra Wright;Megan Ballweber;Karl Meisel;David Saloner;Matthew Amans
923,Alessia Rubini,"OBJECTIVES
The stapedius muscle, tendon, and pyramidal eminence are structures within the retrotympanum. In cholesteatoma surgery, the retrotympanum is a common site of residual disease. The removal of the pyramidal eminence during surgery is sometimes necessary to obtain better visualization of the superior retrotympanum during surgery. Understanding the relational anatomy of structures in the region to the facial nerve allows the surgeon to safely access regional disease. This study aims to better understand the anatomical relationship between the mastoid portion of the facial nerve, the pyramidal eminence, and the stapedius muscle. A secondary aim is to demonstrate that removal of the stapedius muscle in the cadaver model, can increase exposure to the retrotympanic space.


STUDY DESIGN
Anatomical cadaveric observation study.


METHODS
Endoscopic dissection of cadaveric heads was undertaken. Classification of the superior and inferior retrotympanic area was performed. The anatomy of the stapedius muscle was described including relationships, depth, course, and angle with respect to the facial nerve. The pyramidal eminence and stapedius muscle were removed in all specimens and the exposure of the retrotympanum re-evaluated to determine if exposure of the region was increased.


RESULTS
In all cases (11 ears), the stapedius muscle was located medial and anterior to the mastoid portion of the facial nerve, with the second genu superior. The mean antero-posterior distance from the apex of the pyramidal eminence, which the stapedius tendon enters, to the stapes itself was 4.10 mm (range, 2.92-5.73 mm; standard deviation [SD] 0.90 mm). In all cases, irrespective of sinus tympani conformation, removal of the pyramidal eminence and stapedial bony crest in proximity to the facial nerve allowed exposure of the whole retrotympanic region, using a 0-degree endoscope.


CONCLUSIONS
The pyramidal eminence and stapedius muscle have a relatively constant relationship to the facial nerve. Removal of the stapedius muscle in the human cadaver model increases the exposure of the sinus tympani and subpyramidal space. Increased visualization in this region, may reduce risk of residual cholesteatoma in patients.",Nicholas Jufas;Daniele Marchioni;Alexander J Saxby;Jonathan H K Kong;Nirmal P Patel

Auditory and vestibular outcomes after placement of a vestibular-cochlear implant in subjects with varying causes of vestibular loss.


STUDY DESIGN
Prospective case study.


SETTING
Tertiary referral center.


PATIENTS
Three human subjects received a vestibular-cochlear implant. Subject 1 had sudden hearing and vestibular loss 10 years before implantation. Subjects 2 and 3 had bilateral Menière's disease with resolution of acute attacks. All subjects had severe-profound deafness in the implanted ear and bilateral vestibular loss.


INTERVENTION
Vestibular-cochlear implant with electrode positions confirmed by CT.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Electrically-evoked vestibular and cochlear compound action potentials (ECAPs), speech perception, and electrically-evoked slow-phase eye velocities.


RESULTS
Subject 1 had no vestibular ECAP, but normal cochlear ECAPs and cochlear implant function. She had minimal eye-movement with vestibular stimulation. Subject 2 had vestibular ECAPs. This subject had the largest eye velocities from electrical stimulation that we have seen in humans, exceeding 100 degrees per second. Her cochlear implant functions normally. Subject 3 had vestibular and cochlear ECAPs, and robust eye-movements and cochlear implant function.


CONCLUSION
The etiology of vestibular loss appears to have a profound impact on sensitivity of vestibular afferents in distinction to cochlear afferents. If this dichotomy is common, it may limit the application of vestibular implants to diagnoses with preserved sensitivity of vestibular afferents. We speculate it is due to differences in topographic organization of Scarpa's versus the spiral ganglion. In two subjects, the second-generation device can produce higher velocity eye movements than seen in the four subjects receiving the first-generation device.",Leo Ling;Amy Nowack;Kaibao Nie;James O Phillips

Explore patient characteristics associated with tinnitus improvement after cochlear implantation.


STUDY DESIGN
Retrospective cohort.


SETTING
Tertiary referral.


PATIENTS
Adults with bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss and tinnitus.


INTERVENTIONS
Unilateral cochlear implantation.


RESULTS
From 1996 to 2018, 358 patients endorsed pre-implant tinnitus and had ascertainable tinnitus status at 1-year. Clinically significant improvement in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) (reduction by at least 7-points) was observed in 262 (73.2%) patients, of whom 155 (59.2%) reported complete resolution. Of the 24 characteristics explored, four were identified as independent predictors of improved tinnitus in logistic regression models. In a multivariable model including identified independent predictors, each 10-percentage point increase in baseline hearing in noise test was associated with an 14% reduction in odds of tinnitus resolution or clinically significant improvement (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence limits [CL] 0.77, 0.96) and preoperative use of a hearing aid in the contralateral ear was associated with a 72% reduction (OR 0.28; 95% CL 0.11, 0.73). Each 10-point increase in baseline Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHI) score was associated with a 28% increase in odds of tinnitus improvement (OR 1.28; 95% CL 1.07, 1.54). Higher baseline burden of tinnitus was associated with higher odds of tinnitus improvement (OR 1.21 per 10-point THI increase, 95% CL 1.04, 1.40).


CONCLUSIONS
Worse residual hearing and higher baseline hearing and tinnitus handicap are associated with higher odds of tinnitus improvement.

To investigate the benefits of the image fusion technique for precise postoperative assessment of intracochlear placement with six different electrode arrays.


STUDY DESIGN
Consecutive retrospective case study.


SETTINGS
Tertiary referral center.


PATIENTS
Analyses of imaging data of 30 patients implanted with six different electrode arrays.


INTERVENTIONS
Electrode reconstructions obtained from postoperative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) were overlaid onto preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) registrations to create artefact-free images.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Each electrode's intracochlear position was analyzed with the image fusion reconstructions and compared with the results obtained by CBCT alone. The electrode location was classified according to its position in relation to the basal membrane at four different insertion angles.


RESULTS
In 40 out of 151 measurements (26.5%), the location grading obtained by CBCT alone changed after the assessment with the image fusion reconstructions. A significant association was found between deep insertions (over 360 degrees) and the effectiveness of image fusion (p = 0.019). The difference between the impact of the fusion technique for the basal turn versus the apical part was highly significant (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference between the effectiveness of the image fusion and the different electrodes.

By utilizing an image fusion technique, a more accurate assessment of electrode placement could be achieved for all types of electrodes. Image fusion was especially beneficial for insertions beyond 360 degrees.",Matti Iso-Mustajärvi;Mervi Könönen;Heikki Löppönen;Aarno Dietz
928,Nicholas J Thompson,"HYPOTHESIS
Patients with moderate-to-severe unilateral conductive hearing loss (UCHL) can make use of binaural difference cues when stimuli are presented at a high enough intensity to provide audibility in the affected ear.


BACKGROUND
Spatial hearing is essential for listening in complex environments and sound source localization. Patients with UCHL have decreased access to binaural difference cues, resulting in poorer spatial hearing abilities compared with listeners with normal hearing.


METHODS
Twelve patients with moderate-to-severe UCHL, most due to atresia (83.3%), and 12 age-matched controls with normal hearing bilaterally participated in this study. Outcome measures included: 1) spatial release from masking, and 2) sound source localization. Speech reception thresholds were measured with target speech (Pediatric AzBio sentences) presented at 0 degree and a two-talker masker that was either colocated with the target (0 degree) or spatially separated from the target (symmetrical, ±90 degrees). Spatial release from masking was quantified as the difference between speech reception thresholds in these two conditions. Localization ability in the horizontal plane was assessed in a 180 degree arc of 11 evenly-spaced loudspeakers. These two tasks were completed at 50 and 75 dB SPL.


RESULTS
Both children and adults with UCHL performed more poorly than controls when recognizing speech in a spatially separated masker or localizing sound; however, this group difference was larger at 50 than 75 dB SPL.


CONCLUSION
Patients with UCHL experience improved spatial hearing with the higher presentation level, suggesting that the auditory deprivation associated with a moderate-to-severe UCHL does not preclude exposure to-or use of-binaural difference cues.",Stacey L G Kane;Nicole E Corbin;Michael W Canfarotta;Emily Buss

To determine the correlation between intraoperative changes of electrocochleography (ECochG) responses and traumatic cochlear implant insertions as well as postoperative hearing loss.


METHODS
ECochG, radiological, and audiological data were collected prospectively in a cochlear implant recipient with otosclerosis and assumed cochlear trauma during electrode insertion. A systematic review was conducted within PubMed-NCBI, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library using the terms ""Cochlear implant"" and ""Electrocochleography."" Original studies that evaluated intraoperative ECochG responses and postoperative hearing loss were selected and analyzed.


RESULTS
The case report revealed a drop of intra- and extracochlear ECochG signals during electrode insertion. The postoperative computed tomography scan suggested a scalar dislocation. There was no measurable hearing 4 weeks after surgery. Within the database search, nine articles met the inclusion criteria. All were case series reports (range from 2 to 36 subjects) with a total of 173 subjects. Due to the heterogeneous data, a meta-analysis was unfeasible.


CONCLUSIONS
In concordance with some findings in the literature, the presented case report suggests that a drop of intra- and extracochlear ECochG signals during the insertion of the electrode array is associated with cochlear trauma and postoperative hearing loss in some cases. However, the literature is inconclusive regarding the correlation between intraoperative changes of the ECochG signals and postoperative hearing preservation.

Define the extent to which GJB2-related hearing loss is responsible for non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in the Latino population.


METHODS
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were followed. PubMed and MEDLINE were accessed from 1966 to 2019 using permutations of the MeSH terms: ""Hearing Loss,"" ""Hearing Impairment,"" ""Deafness,"" ""Latin American,"" ""Latino,"" ""GJB2,"" and ""Genetic."" Additionally, countries designated as Latino by the US Office of Management and Bureau were cross-referenced as key terms against the aforementioned search criteria. Exclusion criteria included non-English publications, a non-Latino study population, and literature not investigating GJB2. An allele frequency analysis of pathogenic GJB2 variants in the Latino population was performed and stratified by country of origin and reported ethnicity.


RESULTS
One hundred twenty two unique studies were identified of which 64 met our inclusion criteria. Forty three studies were included in the GJB2 systematic review. A total of 38 pathogenic GJB2 variants were identified across 20 countries in the Latino population. The prevalence of pathogenic GJB2 variants varied by country; however, were generally uncommon with the exception of c.35delG (p.Gly12Valfs*) which displayed an allele frequency of 3.1% in the combined Latino population; ranging from 21% in Colombia to 0% in Guatemala.


CONCLUSION
Variation in the prevalence of pathogenic GJB2 variants by country likely reflect the heterogeneous nature of ethnic ancestral contributions to the Latino population. Additional research utilizing next generation sequencing might aid in the development of assays for high throughput diagnosis of inherited hearing loss in the multitude of ethnic sub-groups that comprise this and other traditionally marginalized populations.",Cameron P Worden;Anita Jeyakumar
932,Shilpa Ojha,"OBJECTIVE
Dizziness is a major contributing factor to poor quality of life for patients with vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). We wished to review the literature on interventions for balance dysfunction in these patients.


DATA SOURCES
A systematic literature review was performed identifying studies that measured balance function before and after treatment for vestibular schwannoma. Data sources include Medline (1950-present), EMBASE (1974-present), Cochrane Library (issue 3, 2008), NHS Centre of reviews and dissemination, Clinical Evidence, Cochrane central register of controlled trial, and CINAHL.


STUDY SELECTION
A minimum follow-up of 6 months was required, to estimate long-term balance function. Eight articles were identified, including five studies with surgical intervention, two studies with stereotactic radiotherapy, and one comparing the two. Study design was generally poor with a high risk of bias. These studies all utilized the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) as a measure of pre- and postintervention balance function.


DATA EXTRACTION
Results showed that overall DHI scores are not statistically affected by intervention irrespective of modality (surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy). Patients selected with severe dizziness, who undergo surgery, improved postoperatively. No other studies for severe dizziness were noted for comparison.


CONCLUSIONS
Age, sex, and tumor size have no statistically significant effect on DHI outcomes, and no evidence to suggest which treatment modality has better dizziness related outcomes.No specific treatment modality was superior in terms of long-term balance function. Patients with severe dizziness may benefit from surgery, although no comparator studies were identified.",Philip J Clamp

Subjects were evaluated before and after treatment, with follow-up assessment after 3 months. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score. Secondary outcome measures were selected to assess motor function, activities, and participation.


RESULTS
One hundred ninety subjects completed the posttreatment assessment, with a subset (n = 122) returning for follow-up evaluation. Mean FMA score improvement in the robotic group was 8.50 (confidence interval: 6.82 to 10.17), versus 8.57 (confidence interval: 6.97 to 10.18) in the conventional group, with no significant between-groups difference (adjusted mean difference -0.08, P = 0.948). Both groups also had similar change in secondary measures, except for the Motricity Index, with better results for the robotic group (adjusted mean difference 4.42, P = 0.037). At follow-up, subjects continued to improve with no between-groups differences.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Robotic treatment using a set of 4 devices significantly improved UL motor function, activities, and participation in subjects with subacute stroke to the same extent as a similar amount of conventional therapy.

934,Morgane Prime,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
People with Parkinson disease (PD) present phenotypes that are characterized as tremor-dominant (TD) or postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes. Differentiation of subtypes allows clinicians to predict disease course and adjust treatment. We examined whether brief mobility and balance measures can discriminate PIGD from TD phenotypes.


METHODS
We performed a cross-sectional study with individuals with PD (n = 104). Blinded raters assessed participants with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) or Movement Disorders Society revision (MDS-UPDRS), and balance assessments: 360° turn test, one-leg stance, a reactive postural control test, and tandem walk. Participants were classified as PIGD or TD based on the UPDRS or MDS-UPDRS assessment results. Differences in balance variables between subtypes were assessed with univariate analyses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to investigate the ability of balance variables to differentiate PD subtypes.


RESULTS
No differences between subtypes were observed for tandem walk or reactive postural control. Participants with PIGD performed worse on number of steps and time to complete the 360° turn test and on one-leg stance time. ROC curves showed only the 360° turn test discriminated PIGD from TD with high specificity (0.84). Post hoc analyses revealed that the 360° turn test is the most discriminatory for classifying PD subtypes in early stages of the disease. ROC analyses based on combined models including both the 360° test and tandem walk test performance increased the specificity to 0.97.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The 360° turn test requires minimal time to administer and may be useful in mild-moderate PD for distinguishing PIGD from TD subtypes.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A295).",J Lucas McKay;Allison A Bay;Ariel R Hart;Chaejin Kim;Amit Abraham;Madeleine E Hackney
935,Louis N Awad,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The ankle plantarflexor muscles are the primary generators of propulsion during walking. Impaired paretic plantarflexion is a key contributor to interlimb propulsion asymmetry after stroke. Poststroke muscle weakness may be the result of a reduced force-generating capacity, reduced central drive, or a combination of these impairments. This study sought to elucidate the relationship between the neuromuscular function of the paretic plantarflexor muscles and propulsion deficits across individuals with different walking speeds.


METHODS
For 40 individuals poststroke, we used instrumented gait analysis and dynamometry coupled with supramaximal electrostimulation to study the interplay between limb kinematics, the neuromuscular function of the paretic plantarflexors (ie, strength capacity and central drive), propulsion, and walking speed.


RESULTS
The strength capacity of the paretic plantarflexors was not independently related to paretic propulsion. Reduced central drive to the paretic plantarflexors independently contributed to paretic propulsion deficits. An interaction between walking speed and plantarflexor central drive was observed. Individuals with slower speeds and lower paretic plantarflexor central drive presented with the largest propulsion impairments. Some study participants with low paretic plantarflexor central drive presented with similarly fast speeds as those with near-normal central drive by leveraging a compensatory reliance on nonparetic propulsion. The final model accounted for 86% of the variance in paretic propulsion (R = 0.86, F = 33.10, P < 0.001).


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Individuals poststroke have latent paretic plantarflexion strength that they are not able to voluntarily access. The magnitude of central drive deficit is a strong indicator of propulsion impairment in both slow and fast walkers.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A298).",HaoYuan Hsiao;Stuart A Binder-Macleod
936,Alberto A Uribe,"One of the most common and distressing symptoms after craniotomy is postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). PONV could generate delayed postanesthesia care and hospitalization discharge, lower patient satisfaction, and an increase in overall hospitalization costs. The incidence of reported PONV after craniotomy is 22% to 70% without prophylaxis, and a multimodal regimen of medication has been recommended. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of the clinical evidence related to PONV prevention and management after craniotomy. All clinical trials in adult populations relevant to PONV after craniotomy available in English language and indexed in PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library databases from January 1997 up to September 2018 were retrieved using a combination of free-text words related to PONV in craniotomy. After screening manuscripts identified in the initial search, 23 clinical trials investigating systemic pharmacological intervention versus placebo or active control in patients undergoing craniotomy under general anesthesia met the criteria for inclusion in this comprehensive narrative review. The pathophysiology and mechanisms of PONV after craniotomy could be multifactorial in etiology. Therefore, based on current evidence, PONV management after craniotomy should focus on perioperative patient assessment, surgical, and anesthesia-related risk factors and the selection of systemic pharmacological considerations to reduce its incidence and complications. A multimodal regimen of medication targeting different chemoreceptors in the vomiting center is recommended. Ondansetron and dexamethasone, or their combination, are the most frequently used and effective agents. Further randomized clinical trials comparing different regimens that significantly reduce the incidence of PONV in craniotomy would provide relevant evidence-based data for PONV management in this patient population.",Nicoleta Stoicea;Marco Echeverria-Villalobos;Alexandre B Todeschini;Alan Esparza Gutierrez;Antonia R Folea;Sergio D Bergese
937,Linda D'Antona,"BACKGROUND
Patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) are often elderly, frail and affected by multimorbidity. Treatment is surgical with cerebrospinal diversion shunts. The selection of patients that are of an acceptable level of risk to be treated surgically has been a matter of debate for years and has deprived some patients of life-changing surgery. The aim of this service evaluation was to investigate the preoperative risk factors and early postoperative morbidity of patients with NPH using a standardized postoperative survey.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Consecutive NPH patients admitted for neurosurgical management of NPH between May 2017 and May 2018 were included in this prospective service evaluation. In addition to the collection of traditional outcome measures, the cardiac version of the Postoperative Morbidity Survey (C-POMS) was conducted on postoperative days 4, 7, and 10 to identify postoperative morbidity.


RESULTS
Eighty-eight patients (63 males, age mean±SD, 75±7 y) underwent 106 surgical procedures (61 lumbar drains, 45 ventriculoperitoneal shunts). There was no 30-day mortality and no unexpected return to the operating room or admission to intensive care unit. There was 1 conservatively managed surgical complication. On postoperative day 4, the C-POMS identified no postoperative morbidity in 72% of the patients, and mild morbidity (postoperative nausea and mobility issues) in 28%. There was a delay in discharge in 50% of the patients with no postoperative morbidity on day 4, highlighting areas of our service requiring improvement.


CONCLUSIONS
Early postoperative outcomes of NPH patients are good after both ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion and lumbar drainage. This evaluation provides initial evidence on the utility of the C-POMS as a service evaluation tool in the standardized assessment postoperative outcomes in neurosurgery patients.",Sandra C Blamey;Claudia L Craven;Darreul Sewell;Shivani Manohara;Michelle Leemans;Susannah Worby;Simon D Thompson;Aida K Golahmadi;Jonathan P Funnell;Lewis Thorne;Laurence D Watkins;Astri M V Luoma;Ahmed K Toma
938,Hirokazu Kawase,"BACKGROUND
Brain ischemia due to disruption of cerebral blood flow (CBF) results in increases in extracellular glutamate concentration and neuronal cell damage. However, the impact of CBF on glutamate dynamics after the loss of the membrane potential remains unknown.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
To determine this impact, we measured extracellular potential, CBF, and extracellular glutamate concentration in the parietal cortex in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=21). CBF was reduced by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries and exsanguination until loss of extracellular membrane potential was observed (low-flow group), or until CBF was further reduced by 5% to 10% of preischemia levels (severe-low-flow group). CBF was promptly restored 10 minutes after the loss of membrane potential. Histologic outcomes were evaluated 5 days later.


RESULTS
Extracellular glutamate concentration in the low-flow group was significantly lower than that in the severe-low-flow group. Moreover, increases in extracellular glutamate concentration exhibited a linear relationship with decreases in CBF after the loss of membrane potential in the severe-low-flow group, and the percentage of damaged neurons exhibited a dose-response relationship with the extracellular glutamate concentration. The extracellular glutamate concentration required to cause 50% neuronal damage was estimated to be 387 μmol/L, at 8.7% of preischemia CBF. Regression analyses revealed that extracellular glutamate concentration increased by 21 μmol/L with each 1% decrease in residual CBF and that the percentage of damaged neurons increased by 2.6%.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate that residual CBF is an important factor that determines the extracellular glutamate concentration after the loss of membrane potential, and residual CBF would be one of the important determinants of neuronal cell prognosis.",Yoshimasa Takeda;Ryoichi Mizoue;Sachiko Sato;Miki Fushimi;Satoshi Murai;Hiroshi Morimatsu
939,Sarah Gourmaud,"Temporal lobe epilepsy represents a major cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. Cognitive impairment is a frequent comorbidity, but the mechanisms are not fully elucidated. We hypothesized that the cognitive impairment in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy could be due to perturbations of amyloid and tau signalling pathways related to activation of stress kinases, similar to those observed in Alzheimer's disease. We examined these pathways, as well as amyloid-β and tau pathologies in the hippocampus and temporal lobe cortex of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients who underwent temporal lobe resection (n = 19), in comparison with age- and region-matched samples from neurologically normal autopsy cases (n = 22). Post-mortem temporal cortex samples from Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 9) were used as positive controls to validate many of the neurodegeneration-related antibodies. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis of tissue from temporal lobe epilepsy cases revealed increased phosphorylation of full-length amyloid precursor protein and its associated neurotoxic cleavage product amyloid-β*56. Pathological phosphorylation of two distinct tau species was also increased in both regions, but increases in amyloid-β1-42 peptide, the main component of amyloid plaques, were restricted to the hippocampus. Furthermore, several major stress kinases involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology were significantly activated in temporal lobe epilepsy brain samples, including the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase. In temporal lobe epilepsy cases, hippocampal levels of phosphorylated amyloid precursor protein, its pro-amyloidogenic processing enzyme beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and both total and hyperphosphorylated tau expression, correlated with impaired preoperative executive function. Our study suggests that neurodegenerative and stress-related processes common to those observed in Alzheimer's disease may contribute to cognitive impairment in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. In particular, we identified several stress pathways that may represent potential novel therapeutic targets.",Haochang Shou;David J Irwin;Kimberly Sansalone;Leah M Jacobs;Timothy H Lucas;Eric D Marsh;Kathryn A Davis;Frances E Jensen;Delia M Talos
940,Kaj Blennow,"To date, there is no validated fluid biomarker for tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease, with contradictory results from studies evaluating the correlation between phosphorylated tau in CSF with tau PET imaging. Tau protein is subjected to proteolytic processing into fragments before being secreted to the CSF. A recent study suggested that tau cleavage after amino acid 368 by asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease. We used immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric analyses to evaluate the presence of tau368 species in CSF. A novel Simoa® assay for quantification of tau368 in CSF was developed, while total tau (t-tau) was measured by ELISA and the presence of tau368 in tangles was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The diagnostic utility of tau368 was first evaluated in a pilot study (Alzheimer's disease = 20, control = 20), then in a second cohort where the IWG-2 biomarker criteria were applied (Alzheimer's disease = 37, control = 45), and finally in a third cohort where the correlation with 18F-GTP1 tau PET was evaluated (Alzheimer's disease = 38, control = 11). The tau368/t-tau ratio was significantly decreased in Alzheimer's disease (P < 0.001) in all cohorts. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that tau fragments ending at 368 are present in tangles. There was a strong negative correlation between the CSF tau368/t-tau ratio and 18F-GTP1 retention. Our data suggest that tau368 is a tangle-enriched fragment and that the CSF ratio tau368/t-tau reflects tangle pathology. This novel tau biomarker could be used to improve diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and to facilitate the development of drug candidates targeting tau pathology. Furthermore, future longitudinal studies will increase our understanding of tau pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.",Chun Chen;Claudia Cicognola;Kristin R Wildsmith;Paul T Manser;Sandra M Sanabria Bohorquez;Zhentao Zhang;Boer Xie;Junmin Peng;Oskar Hansson;Hlin Kvartsberg;Erik Portelius;Henrik Zetterberg;Tammaryn Lashley;Gunnar Brinkmalm;Geoffrey A Kerchner;Robby M Weimer;Keqiang Ye;Kina Höglund
941,Anika Bongaarts,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurocutaneous disorder caused by inactivating mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, key regulators of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. In the CNS, TSC is characterized by cortical tubers, subependymal nodules and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). SEGAs may lead to impaired circulation of CSF resulting in hydrocephalus and raised intracranial pressure in patients with TSC. Currently, surgical resection and mTORC1 inhibitors are the recommended treatment options for patients with SEGA. In the present study, high-throughput RNA-sequencing (SEGAs n = 19, periventricular control n = 8) was used in combination with computational approaches to unravel the complexity of SEGA development. We identified 9400 mRNAs and 94 microRNAs differentially expressed in SEGAs compared to control tissue. The SEGA transcriptome profile was enriched for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, a major regulator of cell proliferation and survival. Analysis at the protein level confirmed that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is activated in SEGAs. Subsequently, the inhibition of ERK independently of mTORC1 blockade decreased efficiently the proliferation of primary patient-derived SEGA cultures. Furthermore, we found that LAMTOR1, LAMTOR2, LAMTOR3, LAMTOR4 and LAMTOR5 were overexpressed at both gene and protein levels in SEGA compared to control tissue. Taken together LAMTOR1-5 can form a complex, known as the 'Ragulator' complex, which is known to activate both mTORC1 and MAPK/ERK pathways. Overall, this study shows that the MAPK/ERK pathway could be used as a target for treatment independent of, or in combination with mTORC1 inhibitors for TSC patients. Moreover, our study provides initial evidence of a possible link between the constitutive activated mTORC1 pathway and a secondary driver pathway of tumour growth.",Jackelien van Scheppingen;Anatoly Korotkov;Caroline Mijnsbergen;Jasper J Anink;Floor E Jansen;Wim G M Spliet;Wilfred F A den Dunnen;Victoria E Gruber;Theresa Scholl;Sharon Samueli;Johannes A Hainfellner;Martha Feucht;Katarzyna Kotulska;Sergiusz Jozwiak;Wieslawa Grajkowska;Anna Maria Buccoliero;Chiara Caporalini;Flavio Giordano;Lorenzo Genitori;Roland Coras;Ingmar Blümcke;Pavel Krsek;Josef Zamecnik;Lisethe Meijer;Brendon P Scicluna;Antoinette Y N Schouten-van Meeteren;Angelika Mühlebner;James D Mills;Eleonora Aronica

The various clinical aspects related to bradykinesia and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying bradykinesia are, however, still unclear. In this article, we review clinical and experimental studies on bradykinesia performed in patients with Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism. We also review studies on animal experiments dealing with pathophysiological aspects of the parkinsonian state. In Parkinson's disease, bradykinesia is characterized by slowness, the reduced amplitude of movement, and sequence effect. These features are also present in atypical parkinsonisms, but the sequence effect is not common. Levodopa therapy improves bradykinesia, but treatment variably affects the bradykinesia features and does not significantly modify the sequence effect. Findings from animal and patients demonstrate the role of the basal ganglia and other interconnected structures, such as the primary motor cortex and cerebellum, as well as the contribution of abnormal sensorimotor processing.

943,Christopher C Y Mak,"MN1 encodes a transcriptional co-regulator without homology to other proteins, previously implicated in acute myeloid leukaemia and development of the palate. Large deletions encompassing MN1 have been reported in individuals with variable neurodevelopmental anomalies and non-specific facial features. We identified a cluster of de novo truncating mutations in MN1 in a cohort of 23 individuals with strikingly similar dysmorphic facial features, especially midface hypoplasia, and intellectual disability with severe expressive language delay. Imaging revealed an atypical form of rhombencephalosynapsis, a distinctive brain malformation characterized by partial or complete loss of the cerebellar vermis with fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres, in 8/10 individuals. Rhombencephalosynapsis has no previously known definitive genetic or environmental causes. Other frequent features included perisylvian polymicrogyria, abnormal posterior clinoid processes and persistent trigeminal artery. MN1 is encoded by only two exons. All mutations, including the recurrent variant p.Arg1295* observed in 8/21 probands, fall in the terminal exon or the extreme 3' region of exon 1, and are therefore predicted to result in escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This was confirmed in fibroblasts from three individuals. We propose that the condition described here, MN1 C-terminal truncation (MCTT) syndrome, is not due to MN1 haploinsufficiency but rather is the result of dominantly acting C-terminally truncated MN1 protein.

944,Taro Yonekura,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster can process chromatic information for true color vision and spectral preference. Spectral information is initially detected by a few distinct photoreceptor channels with different spectral sensitivities and is processed through the visual circuit. The neuroanatomical bases of the circuit are emerging. However, only little information is available in chromatic response properties of higher visual neurons from this important model organism. We used in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in response to monochromatic light stimuli ranging from 300 to 650 nm with 25-nm steps. We characterized the chromatic response of 33 higher visual neurons, including their general response type and their wavelength tuning. Color-opponent-type responses that had been typically observed in primates and bees were not identified. Instead, the majority of neurons showed excitatory responses to broadband wavelengths. The UV (300-375 nm) and middle wavelength (425-575 nm) ranges could be separated at the population level owing to neurons that preferentially responded to a specific wavelength range. Our results provide a first mapping of chromatic information processing in higher visual neurons of D. melanogaster that is a suitable model for exploring how color-opponent neural mechanisms are implemented in the visual circuits.",Junji Yamauchi;Takako Morimoto;Yoichi Seki
945,Hun Ho Park,"BACKGROUND
Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (AH) is a surgical option for patients with medically intractable seizures from mesial temporal lobe pathology. The transcranial route is considered the best method to achieve this goal. However, the standard approach through the neocortex is still invasive. The risks can be minimized if the mesial temporal lobe is resected while preserving the lateral temporal lobe and the Meyer's loop. This study explores the feasibility of selective AH by endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) in cadaveric specimens.


METHODS
The endoscopic anatomy of the mesial temporal lobe and the feasibility of a successful selective AH were studied in six hemispheres from three injected human cadavers. Quantitative analyses on the extent of resection and angles of exposure were performed based on CT and MRI studies of pre- and post-selective AH and measurements taken during dissections.


RESULTS
The EEA V1-V2 corridor provided a direct and logical line of access to the mesial temporal lobe, following its natural trajectory with no brain retraction and minimal exposure of the pterygopalatine fossa. The components of the mesial temporal lobe were resected just as selectively and easily as the transcranial route, but without compromising the structures of the lateral temporal lobe or the Meyer's loop.


CONCLUSIONS
The EEA V1-V2 corridor demonstrated its selective resectability and accessibility of the mesial temporal lobe in cadaveric specimens. The clinical value of this approach should be explored responsibly by a surgeon with both competent microsurgical skills and experiences in EEA.",Daniel Ronconi;Shunya Hanakita;Kentaro Watanabe;Moujahed Labidi;Anne-Laure Bernat;Sébastien Froelich

948,Florian Grimm,"BACKGROUND
In the treatment of childhood hydrocephalus, 3D volumetry seems to have many advantages over classical planar index measurements for dedicated monitoring of changes in cerebrospinal fluid and brain volume. Nevertheless, this method requires extensive technical effort and access to the complete three-dimensional data set. Against this background, we evaluated the possibility of planar area determination in a single plane and the correlation to volumetry.


METHODS
138 routinely performed true FISP MRI sequences (1 mm isovoxel) were analyzed retrospectively in 68 patients with pediatric hydrocephalus. After preprocessing, the 3D-data sets were skull stripped to estimate the inner skull volume. A 2-class segmentation into different tissue types (brain matter and CSF) was performed, and the volumes of CSF (VCSF) and brain matter (VBrain) were calculated. A plane at the level of the foramina of Monro was manually identified in the ac-pc oriented data. In this plane, the areas of brain (ABrain) and CSF (ACSF) in cm2 were calculated and used for further correlation analysis.


RESULTS
Mean VCSF was 340 ± 145 cm3 and VBrain 1173 ± 254 cm3. In the selected plane, ACSF was 26 ± 14 cm2, and ABrain was 107 ± 25 cm2. There was a very strong positive correlation between both ACSF and VCSF (r = 0.895) and between ABrain and VBrain (r = 0.846). The prediction equations for VBrain and VCSF were highly significant.


CONCLUSION
Planar area determination of brain and CSF correlates excellently with both VCSF and VBrain. Thus, areas can serve as a surrogate marker for total brain and CSF volumes for a quantitated objective tracking of changes during treatment of childhood hydrocephalus.",Florian Edl;Isabel Gugel;Susanne R Kerscher;Martin U Schuhmann
949,Hannah Fuhrer,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) improves early clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke but insights on determinants of long-term outcome after MT treatment are scarce.


METHODS
Data from stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion of a prospective MT registry (01/2014-06/2017) of a large comprehensive stroke center were analyzed regarding clinical outcome between short- (3 months) and long-term (12 months) assessment reflected by a change of modified Rankin scores (∆mRS). Secondary endpoints included favorable long-term outcome (mRS 0-2). Multi-variable regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of outcome changes and favorable outcome at long term.


RESULTS
Of 264 patients included, 42.0% showed a favorable long-term outcome. Longitudinal analysis found that some individuals still improved, but no overall mRS difference between short and long-term follow-up was detected [∆mRS - 0.004 (95% CI - 0.020; 0.013); p = 0.672]. Right hemispheric stroke [∆mRS 0.286 (0.011; 0.561); p = 0.043] and high NIHSS at discharge [∆mRS, 0.039 (0.004; 0.074); p = 0.029] were associated with a longitudinal mRS decline. Favorable long-term outcome was associated with successful recanalization (p < 0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS
A significant number of patients with MT experience a favorable long-term outcome. Outcomes remained stable between short- and long-term follow-up, but some individuals may still show improvement beyond short-term rehabilitation. Right hemispheric stroke and clinical stroke severity at hospital discharge may be frail predictors for delayed decline of functional status, whereas successful recanalization remains a positive outcome predictor.

952,Matthias Schneider,"Postoperative new cranial nerve deficits comprise severe concomitant morbidity in skull base meningioma surgery. Therefore, long-term cranial nerve integrity represents an important outcome measure. In the current study, we analyzed our institutional database in order to identify risk factors for postoperative new cranial nerve morbidity in the course of frontobasal meningioma surgery. Between 2009 and 2017, 195 patients were surgically treated for frontobasal meningioma at the authors' institution. Postoperative cranial nerve function was assessed immediately after surgery as well as 12 months postoperatively. A univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors influencing favorable postoperative cranial nerve outcome. Tumors with histological Mib-1-labeling indices > 5% were associated with a significantly higher percentage of new cranial nerve deficits immediately after surgery compared with those with Mib-1-labeling indices ≤ 5% (39% versus 20%, p = 0.029). Elevated Mib-1-labeling indices could be correlated with high CD68-positive macrophage staining (54% for Mib-1 index > 5% versus 19% for Mib-1 index ≤ 5%, p = 0.001). Elevated Mib-1-labeling index correlates with initial new cranial nerve dysfunction after resection of frontal skull base meningioma. With regard to elevated CD68-positive macrophage staining in high Mib-1-positive meningiomas, initial postoperative new cranial nerve morbidity might partly reflect macrophage-based inflammatory immune responses.",Valeri Borger;Ági Güresir;Albert Becker;Hartmut Vatter;Patrick Schuss;Erdem Güresir
953,Michelle Allan,"INTRODUCTION
The main objective of this study was to examine discontinuation rates associated with delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) when used for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) in a real-world, clinical practice setting.


METHODS
Data were collected retrospectively from charts of adult patients with relapsing-remitting MS treated at a single large institution in Australia, who completed at least 6 months of continuous therapy, either with DMF or another MS medication administered following DMF discontinuation. The primary endpoint was overall discontinuation rate. Secondary endpoints included discontinuation rate 6 months after initiation of DMF therapy; incidence of adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal events; discontinuation rate because of adverse events; and use of concomitant medications by patients during administration of DMF.


RESULTS
A total of 100 patients initially prescribed DMF between October 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014 were included in the analysis. The mean age of the patients was 43 years and 80% were female. The overall discontinuation rate was 13%, with 9% discontinuing because of gastrointestinal tolerability issues, within the first 6 months. Dose changes as a result of adverse events occurred in 15% of patients, and none of the adverse events reported were serious. Only one patient discontinued owing to lack of efficacy.


CONCLUSION
This study, conducted shortly after the approval of DMF in Australia when first-hand clinical experience was still limited, demonstrated that DMF has an acceptable tolerability profile in the real-world setting that is similar to that demonstrated in clinical trials.",Lindsay Grant
954,Brett E Youngerman,"BACKGROUND
Evidence supporting routine postoperative antiepileptic drug (AED) prophylaxis following oncologic neurosurgery is limited, and actual practice patterns are largely unknown beyond survey data.


OBJECTIVE
To describe patterns and predictors of postoperative AED prophylaxis following intracranial tumor surgery.


METHODS
The MarketScan Database was used to analyze pharmacy claims data and clinical characteristics in a national sample over a 5-year period.


RESULTS
Among 5895 patients in the cohort, levetiracetam was the most widely used AED for prophylaxis (78.5%) followed by phenytoin (20.5%). Prophylaxis was common but highly variable for patients who underwent open resection of supratentorial intraparenchymal tumors (62.5%, reference) or meningiomas (61.9%). In multivariate analysis, biopsies were less likely to receive prophylaxis (44.8%, OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.33-0.67), and there was near consensus against prophylaxis for infratentorial (9.7%, OR 0.07, CI 0.05-0.09) and transsphenoidal procedures (0.4%, OR 0.003, CI 0.001-0.010). Primary malignancies (52.1%, reference) and secondary metastases (42.2%) were more likely to receive prophylaxis than benign tumors (23.0%, OR 0.63, CI 0.48-0.83), as were patients discharged with home services and patients in the Northeast. There was a large spike in duration of AED use at approximately 30 days.


CONCLUSIONS
Use of seizure prophylaxis following intracranial biopsies and supratentorial resections is highly variable, consistent with a lack of guidelines or consensus. Current practice patterns do not support a clear standard of care and may be driven in part by geographic variation, availability of post-discharge services, and electronic prescribing defaults rather than evidence. Given uncertainty regarding effectiveness, indications, and appropriate duration of AED prophylaxis, well-powered trials are needed.",Evan F Joiner;Xianling Wang;Jingyan Yang;Mary R Welch;Guy M McKhann;Jason D Wright;Dawn L Hershman;Alfred I Neugut;Jeffrey N Bruce
955,Dorit Cohen-Carmon,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative late-onset genetic disorder caused by CAG expansions in the coding region of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, resulting in a poly-glutamine (polyQ) expanded HTT protein. Considerable efforts have been devoted for studying HD and other polyQ diseases using animal models and cell culture systems, but no treatment currently exists. Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an elegant solution for modeling human diseases. However, as embryonic or rejuvenated cells, respectively, these pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) do not recapitulate the late-onset feature of the disease. Here, we applied a robust and rapid differentiation protocol to derive electrophysiologically active striatal GABAergic neurons from human wild-type (WT) and HD ESCs and iPSCs. RNA-seq analyses revealed that HD and WT PSC-derived neurons are highly similar in their gene expression patterns. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Progerin in both WT and HD neurons exacerbated the otherwise non-significant changes in gene expression between these cells, revealing IGF1 and genes involved in neurogenesis and nervous system development as consistently altered in the HD cells. This work provides a useful tool for modeling HD in human PSCs and reveals potential molecular targets altered in HD neurons.",Matan Sorek;Vitaly Lerner;Malka Nissim-Rafinia;Yosef Yarom;Eran Meshorer
956,Shivesh Ghura,"People living with HIV (PLWH) in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era may lose more life-years to tobacco use than to HIV. Yet, smoking rates are more than twice as high among PLWH than the general population, contributing not just to mortality but to other adverse health outcomes, including neurocognitive deficits (neuroHIV). There is growing evidence that synergy with chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation that persists despite ART may be one mechanism by which tobacco smoking contributes to neuroHIV. This review will summarize the differential effects of nicotine vs tobacco smoking on inflammation in addition to the effects of tobacco smoke components on HIV disease progression. We will also discuss biomarkers of inflammation via neuroimaging as well as biomarkers of nicotine dependence (e.g., nicotine metabolite ratio). Tobacco smoking and nicotine may impact ART drug metabolism and conversely, certain ARTs may impact nicotine metabolism. Thus, we will review these bidirectional relationships and how they may contribute to neuroHIV and other adverse outcomes. We will also discuss the effects of tobacco use on the interaction between peripheral organs (lungs, heart, kidney) and subsequent CNS function in the context of HIV. Lastly, given the dramatic rise in the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, we will discuss the implications of vaping on these processes. Despite the growing recognition of the importance of addressing tobacco use among PLWH, more research is necessary at both the preclinical and clinical level to disentangle the potentially synergistic effects of tobacco use, nicotine, HIV, cognition and immune dysregulation, as well as identify optimal approaches to reduce tobacco use. Graphical Abstract Proposed model of the relationships among HIV, ART, smoking, inflammation, and neurocognition. Solid lines represent relationships supported by evidence. Dashed lines represent relationships for which there is not enough evidence to make a conclusion. (a) HIV infection produces elevated levels of inflammation even among virally suppressed individuals. (b) HIV is associated with deficits in cognition function. (c) Smoking rates are higher among PLWH, compared to the general population. (d) The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) is associated with smoking behavior. (e) HIV and tobacco use are both associated with higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression, and elevated levels of chronic stress. These factors may represent other mechanisms linking HIV and tobacco use. (f) The relationship between nicotine, tobacco smoking, and inflammation is complex, but it is well-established that smoking induces inflammation; the evidence for nicotine as anti-inflammatory is supported in some studies, but not others. (g) The relationship between tobacco use and neurocognition may differ for the effects of nicotine (acute nicotine use may have beneficial effects) vs. tobacco smoking (chronic use may impair cognition). (h) Elevated levels of inflammation may be associated with deficits in cognition. (i) PLWH may metabolize nicotine faster than those without HIV; the mechanism is not yet known and the finding needs validation in larger samples. We also hypothesize that if HIV-infection increases nicotine metabolism, then we should observe an attenuation effect once ART is initiated. (j) It is possible that the increase in NMR is due to ART effects on CYP2A6. (k) We hypothesize that faster nicotine metabolism may result in higher levels of inflammation since nicotine has anti-inflammatory properties.",Robert Gross;Kelly Jordan-Sciutto;Jacob Dubroff;Robert Schnoll;Ronald G Collman;Rebecca L Ashare
957,Albert W Pilkington,"A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the formation of senile plaques comprised of the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide. Aβ fibrillization is a complex nucleation-dependent process involving a variety of metastable intermediate aggregates and features the formation of inter and intramolecular salt bridges involving lysine residues, K16 and K28. Cationic lysine residues also mediate protein-lipid interactions via association with anionic lipid headgroups. As several toxic mechanisms attributed to Aβ involve membrane interactions, the impact of acetylation on Aβ40 aggregation in the presence and absence of membranes was determined. Using chemical acetylation, varying mixtures of acetylated and non-acetylated Aβ40 were produced. With increasing acetylation, fibril and oligomer formation decreased, eventually completely arresting fibrillization. In the presence of total brain lipid extract (TBLE) vesicles, acetylation reduced the interaction of Aβ40 with membranes; however, fibrils still formed at near complete levels of acetylation. Additionally, the combination of TBLE and acetylated Aβ promoted annular aggregates. Finally, toxicity associated with Aβ40 was reduced with increasing acetylation in a cell culture assay. These results suggest that in the absence of membranes that the cationic character of lysine plays a major role in fibril formation. However, acetylation promotes unique aggregation pathways in the presence of lipid membranes.",Jane Schupp;Morgan Nyman;Stephen J Valentine;David M Smith;Justin Legleiter
958,Andrea Castellucci,"OBJECTIVE
To describe the possible diagnostic role of video-head impulse test (vHIT) in patients presenting with positional downbeat nystagmus (PDN) due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) involving the anterior canal (AC) or the non-ampullary arm of the posterior canal (PC).


PATIENTS
Three patients presenting with positional vertigo, PDN, symmetrical cervical and ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, and selective deficit of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain for a single vertical canal on vHIT.


INTERVENTIONS
Diagnostic evaluation and rehabilitative treatment for BPPV involving the deficient canals.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Video-oculographic and vHIT findings before and after canalith repositioning procedures (CRP) for AC-BPPV and apogeotropic PC-BPPV.


RESULTS
Each patient was treated with CRP for BPPV involving the hypoactive canal. In one case, symptoms receded with physical therapy, whereas two patients developed a paroxysmal positional upbeat nystagmus consistent with BPPV involving the ampullary arm of the ipsilateral PC and were treated with Epley CRP. Posttreatment evaluation showed resolution of symptoms and signs and restitution of canal function in all cases.


CONCLUSIONS
PDN can be due to both peripheral and central vestibular pathologies. In case of BPPV, involvement of the non-ampullary arm of the PC is hardly distinguishable from contralateral AC canalolithiasis. In these situations, vHIT may play a key role in the differential diagnosis. Considering these findings, we propose to include vHIT in the test battery of patient with PDN, as it may provide clues to the differential diagnosis with central pathologies enabling the identification of the canal involved by BPPV.",Pasquale Malara;Silvia Delmonte;Angelo Ghidini
959,Alice E Huang,"OBJECTIVE
Describe the first case of cochlear implantation (CI) for auditory rehabilitation of a patient with craniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD) and progressive mixed hearing loss.


PATIENTS
A 65-year-old woman with known autosomal dominant CMD presented with progressive mixed hearing loss and declining benefit from conventional hearing aids. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperostosis of the entire craniofacial skeleton. Hearing evaluation demonstrated pure-tone thresholds in the profound range bilaterally by air conduction, and bone conduction thresholds that matched aided thresholds for her left ear, though testing was somewhat limited by inability to mask at high air-conduction thresholds. CI candidacy testing confirmed poor word and sentence scores in the right ear.


INTERVENTION
Due to the inability to access the cochlea via a conventional mastoidectomy and facial recess approach, cochlear implantation via a postauricular subtotal petrosectomy approach with ear canal overclosure was performed.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Post-implantation word and sentence testing.


RESULTS
Despite extensive internal auditory canal stenosis, the patient demonstrated excellent early speech understanding results 5 weeks after device activation. Postimplantation audiologic evaluation showed thresholds between 20 and 30 dB HL from 250 to 6000 Hz. Word and sentence testing scores were 76% Consonant-nucleus-consonant in quiet (up from 2% preoperatively) and 77% AzBio sentences in quiet (up from 10% preoperatively).


CONCLUSION
This report describes the first description of CI for CMD. Despite the extensive radiologic abnormalities, the patient has demonstrated excellent benefit from implantation. Further study of rare temporal bone dysplasias, such as CMD, is critical to better characterize the progression of otologic disease and determine optimal treatment.",Weston J Adkins;Neil S Patel
960,Katryna Pampuscenko,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, found at high levels in neurons, and the aggregation of which is associated with neurodegeneration. Recently it was found that tau can be actively secreted from neurons, but the effects of extracellular tau on neuronal viability are not clear. In this study, we investigated whether extracellular tau2N4R can cause neurotoxicity in primary cultures of rat brain neurons and glial cells. Cell cultures were examined for neuronal loss, death and phosphatidylserine exposure, as well as for microglial phagocytosis by fluorescence microscopy. Aggregation of tau2N4R was assessed by atomic force microscopy. We found that extracellular addition of tau induced a gradual loss of neurons over 1-2 days, without neuronal necrosis or apoptosis, but accompanied by proliferation of microglia in the neuronal-glial co-cultures. Tau addition caused exposure of the ""eat-me"" signal phosphatidylserine on the surface of living neurons, and this was prevented by elimination of the microglia or by inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase. Tau also increased the phagocytic activity of pure microglia, and this was blocked by inhibitors of neutral sphingomyelinase or protein kinase C. The neuronal loss induced by tau was prevented by inhibitors of neutral sphingomyelinase, protein kinase C or the phagocytic receptor MerTK, or by eliminating microglia from the cultures. The data suggest that extracellular tau induces primary phagocytosis of stressed neurons by activated microglia, and identifies multiple ways in which the neuronal loss induced by tau can be prevented.",Ramune Morkuniene;Tomas Sneideris;Vytautas Smirnovas;Rima Budvytyte;Gintaras Valincius;Guy C Brown;Vilmante Borutaite
961,Masumi Akiba,"State-dependent modulation of sensory systems has been studied in many organisms and is possibly mediated through neuromodulators such as monoamine neurotransmitters. Among these, dopamine is involved in many aspects of animal behavior, including movement control, attention, motivation, and cognition. However, the precise neural mechanism underlying dopaminergic modulation of behavior induced by sensory stimuli remains poorly understood. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to show that dopamine can modulate the optomotor response to moving visual stimuli including noise. The optomotor response is the head-turning response to moving objects, which is observed in most sight-reliant animals including mammals and insects. First, the effects of the dopamine system on the optomotor response were investigated in mutant flies deficient in dopamine receptors D1R1 or D1R2, which are involved in the modulation of sleep-arousal in flies. We examined the optomotor response in D1R1 knockout (D1R1 KO) and D1R2 knockout (D1R2 KO) flies and found that it was not affected in D1R1 KO flies; however, it was significantly reduced in D1R2 KO flies compared with the wild type. Using cell-type-specific expression of an RNA interference construct of D1R2, we identified the fan-shaped body, a part of the central complex, responsible for dopamine-mediated modulation of the optomotor response. In particular, pontine cells in the fan-shaped body seemed important in the modulation of the optomotor response, and their neural activity was required for the optomotor response. These results suggest a novel role of the central complex in the modulation of a behavior based on the processing of sensory stimulations.",Kentaro Sugimoto;Risa Aoki;Ryo Murakami;Tomoyuki Miyashita;Riho Hashimoto;Anna Hiranuma;Junji Yamauchi;Taro Ueno;Takako Morimoto
962,Hanni Kiiski,"Adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been described as having altered resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral power and theta/beta ratio (TBR). However, a recent review (Pulini et al. 2018) identified methodological errors in neuroimaging, including EEG, ADHD classification studies. Therefore, the specific EEG neuromarkers of adult ADHD remain to be identified, as do the EEG characteristics that mediate between genes and behavior (mediational endophenotypes). Resting-state eyes-open and eyes-closed EEG were measured from 38 adults with ADHD, 45 first-degree relatives of people with ADHD and 51 unrelated controls. A machine learning classification analysis using penalized logistic regression (Elastic Net) examined if EEG spectral power (1-45 Hz) and TBR could classify participants into ADHD, first-degree relatives and/or control groups. Random-label permutation was used to quantify any bias in the analysis. Eyes-open absolute and relative EEG power distinguished ADHD from control participants (area under receiver operating characteristic = .71-.77). The best predictors of ADHD status were increased power in delta, theta and low-alpha over centro-parietal regions, and in frontal low-beta and parietal mid-beta. TBR did not successfully classify ADHD status. Elevated eyes-open power in delta, theta, low-alpha and low-beta distinguished first-degree relatives from controls (area under receiver operating characteristic = .68-.72), suggesting that these features may be a mediational endophenotype for adult ADHD. Resting-state EEG spectral power may be a neuromarker and mediational endophenotype of adult ADHD. These results did not support TBR as a diagnostic neuromarker for ADHD. It is possible that TBR is a characteristic of childhood ADHD.",Marc Bennett;Laura M Rueda-Delgado;Francesca Farina;Rachel Knight;Rory Boyle;Darren Roddy;Katie Grogan;Jessica Bramham;Clare Kelly;Robert Whelan
963,Haiteng Jiang,"It is well-established that theta (∼4 - 10 Hz) and gamma (∼25 - 100 Hz) oscillations interact in the rat hippocampus. This cross-frequency coupling might facilitate neuronal coordination both within and between brain areas. However, it remains unclear whether the phase of theta oscillations controls the power of slow and fast gamma activity or vice versa. We here applied spectral Granger causality, phase-slope index and a newly developed cross-frequency directionality (CFD) measure to investigate directional interactions between local field potentials recorded within and across hippocampal subregions of CA1 and CA3 of freely exploring rats. Given the well-known CA3 o CA1 anatomical connection, we hypothesized that interregional directional interactions were constrained by anatomical connection, and within-frequency and cross-frequency directional interactions were always from CA3 to CA1. As expected, we found that CA3 drove CA1 in the theta band, and theta phase to gamma power coupling was prominent both within and between CA3 and CA1 regions. The CFD measure further demonstrated distinct directional couplings with respect to theta phase that was different between slow and fast gamma activity. Importantly, CA3 slow gamma power phase adjusted CA1 theta oscillations, suggesting that slow gamma activity in CA3 entrains theta oscillations in CA1. In contrast, CA3 theta phase controls CA1 fast gamma activity, indicating that communication at fast gamma is coordinated by theta phase. Overall, these findings demonstrate dynamic directional interactions between theta and slow/fast gamma oscillations in the hippocampal network, suggesting that anatomical connections constrain the directional interactions.",Ali Bahramisharif;Marcel A J van Gerven;Ole Jensen
964,Liang Yuan,"OBJECTIVE
Ultra-early hematoma growth (uHG) in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has been well established and can improve spot sign in the prediction of hematoma expansion (HE) and poor outcome. This study aimed to investigate whether uHG can improve blend sign as a promising combining marker to stratify HE and poor outcome.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
A consecutive cohort study in patients with primary ICH conducted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical features and radiological characteristics were recorded. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independently risk factors of HE and poor outcome. β coefficient was calculated for combining markers using the logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were fitted to calculate predictive values for each variable and combining markers to stratify HE and poor outcome.


RESULTS
Among 257 ICH patients in the study, there were 85 (33.1 %) patients with HE. Blend sign and uHG were independently associated with HE and poor outcome (P < 0.05). Age, admission GCS score, presence of IVH at baseline CT were also independently associated with poor outcome (P < 0.05). Combining marker including uHG and blend sign had the best AUC (0.846, 0.80-0.90), sensitivity (87.1 %), NPV (91.0 %), and -LR (0.2) than single variable to stratify HE. Combining marker including uHG, blend sign and risk clinical factors had the best AUC (0.800, 0.75-0.85), sensitivity (75.6 %), NPV (73.2 %), -LR (0.33) than single variable and the ICH score to stratify poor outcome. ICH score had the highest PPV (80.3 %) and + LR (3.68) to stratify poor outcome than other variables.

The combination of both uHG and blend sign could be a simple and useful tool for better stratification of HE and poor outcome.",Yi-Qing Shen;Xiong-Fei Xie;Wen-Song Yang;Rui Li;Lan Deng;Qi Li;Peng Xie
965,Steffen R Hage,"Marmoset monkeys are known for their rich vocal repertoire. However, the underlying call production mechanisms remain unclear. By showing that marmoset moneys are capable of interrupting and modulating ongoing vocalizations, recent studies in marmoset monkeys challenged the decades-old concepts of primate vocal pattern generation that suggested that monkey calls consist of one discrete call pattern. The current article will present a revised version of the brainstem vocal pattern-generating network in marmoset monkeys that is capable of responding to perturbing auditory stimuli with rapid modulatory changes of the acoustic call structure during ongoing calls. These audio-vocal integration processes might potentially happen at both the cortical and subcortical brain level.",

Nuclear antigen released from central nervous system (CNS) cells undergoing destruction may induce production of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). We characterized the CNS-specific production of ANA in multiple sclerosis (MS).


METHODS
We assessed CNS-ANA binding to mouse cerebellar cell nuclei by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with sera from 104 MS patients (91 relapsing-remitting; 13 secondary progressive), 30 patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), and 30 healthy controls (HCs). Conventional ANA (cANA) was detected by IFA using human epithelial type-2 cells. CNS-ANA-positive cANA-negative patients were termed CNS-specific ANA-positive. Western blotting (WB) was performed using mouse cerebellar nuclear fractions.


RESULTS
CNS-specific ANA were more frequent in MS than in NMOSD patients or HCs (13.5% vs 0% for both comparisons, both p < .05) and were associated with HLA-DRB1*15:01 (p = .0174). WB revealed a common 55 kDa band in seven MS patients. Compared with CNS-specific ANA-negative MS patients, those with 55 kDa band-immunoreactive CNS-specific ANA showed a higher frequency of secondary progressive MS (42.9% vs 10.0%, p = .0387) and greater Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (4.50 ± 2.02 vs 2.92 ± 2.27, p = .0506).

Off-target [18F]flortaucipir (tau) PET binding in the choroid plexus causes spill-in into the nearby hippocampus, which may influence the correlation between [18F]flortaucipir binding and measures of cognition. Previously, we showed that partial volume correction (combination of Van Cittert iterative deconvolution and HYPR denoising; PVC HDH) and manually eroding the hippocampus resulted in a significant decrease of the choroid plexus spill-in. In this study, we compared three different approaches for the quantification of hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir signal using a semi-automated technique, and assessed correlations with cognitive performance across methods.


METHODS
Dynamic 130 min [18F]flortaucipir PET scans were performed in 109 subjects (45 cognitively normal subjects (CN) and 64 mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia patients. We extracted hippocampal binding potential (BPND) using receptor parametric mapping with cerebellar grey matter as reference region. PVC HDH was performed. Based on our previous study in which we manually eroded 40% ± 10% of voxels of the hippocampus, three hippocampal volumes-of-interest (VOIs) were generated: a non-optimized 100% hippocampal VOI [100%], and combining HDH with eroding a percentage of the highest hippocampus BPND voxels (i.e. lowering spill-in) resulting in optimized 50%[50%HDH] and 40%[40%HDH] hippocampal VOIs. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Rey auditory verbal learning delayed recall. We performed receiver operating characteristic analyses to investigate which method could best discriminate MCI/AD from controls. Subsequently, we performed linear regressions to investigate associations between the hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir BPND VOIs and MMSE/delayed recall adjusted for age, sex and education.


RESULTS
We found higher hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir BPND in MCI/AD patients (BPND100%=0.27±0.15) compared to CN (BPND100%= 0.07±0.13) and all methods showed comparable discriminative effects (AUC100%=0.85[CI=0.78-0.93]; AUC50%HDH=0.84[CI=0.74-0.92]; AUC40%HDH=0.83[CI=0.74-0.92]). Across groups, higher [18F]flortaucipir BPND was related to lower scores on MMSE (standardized β100%=-0.38[CI=-0.57-0.20]; β50%HDH= -0.37[CI=-0.54-0.19]; β40%HDH=-0.35[CI=-0.53-0.17], all p<0.001) and delayed recall (standardized β100%=-0.64[CI=-0.79-0.49]; β50%HDH= -0.61[CI=-0.76-0.46]; β40%HDH=-0.59[CI=-0.75-0.44]; all p<0.001), with comparable effect sizes for all hippocampal VOIs.


CONCLUSIONS
Hippocampal tau load measured with [18F]flortaucipir PET is strongly associated with cognitive function. Both discrimination between diagnostic groups and associations between hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir BPND and memory were comparable for all methods. The non-optimized 100% hippocampal VOI may be sufficient for clinical interpretation.

968,Kimberley Whitehead,"High-grade (large) germinal matrix-intraventricular haemorrhage (GM-IVH) is one of the most common causes of somatomotor neurodisability in pre-term infants. GM-IVH presents during the first postnatal week and can impinge on somatosensory circuits resulting in aberrant somatosensory cortical events straight after injury. Subsequently, somatosensory circuits undergo significant plastic changes, sometimes allowing the reinstatement of a somatosensory cortical response. However, it is not known whether this restructuring results in a full recovery of somatosensory functions. To investigate this, we compared somatosensory responses to mechanical stimulation measured with 18-channels EEG between infants who had high-grade GM-IVH (with ventricular dilatation and/or intraparenchymal lesion; n = 7 studies from 6 infants; mean corrected gestational age = 33 weeks; mean postnatal age = 56 days) and age-matched controls (n = 9 studies from 8 infants; mean corrected gestational age = 32 weeks; mean postnatal age = 36 days). We showed that infants who had high-grade GM-IVH did not recruit the same cortical source configuration following stimulation of the foot, but their response to stimulation of the hand resembled that of controls. These results show that somatosensory cortical circuits are reinstated in infants who had GM-IVH, during the several weeks after injury, but remain different from those of infants without brain injury. An important next step will be to investigate whether these evidences of neural reorganisation predict neurodevelopmental outcome.",Laura Jones;Maria Pureza Laudiano-Dray;Judith Meek;Lorenzo Fabrizi
969,Jeremy S Wetzel,"OBJECTIVE
The malfunction rates of and trends in various cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt designs have been widely studied, but one area that has received little attention is the comparison of the peritoneal distal slit valve (DSV) shunt to other conventional valve (CV) type shunts. The literature that does exist comes from older case series that provide only indirect comparisons, and the conclusions are mixed. Here, the authors provide a direct comparison of the overall survival and failure trends of DSV shunts to those of other valve type shunts.


METHODS
Three hundred seventy-two new CSF shunts were placed in pediatric patients at the authors' institution between January 2011 and December 2015. Only ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts were eligible for study inclusion. Ventriculoatrial, lumboperitoneal, cystoperitoneal, subdural-peritoneal, and spinal shunts were all excluded. Rates and patterns of shunt malfunction were compared, and survival curves were generated. Patterns of failure were categorized as proximal failure, distal failure, simultaneous proximal and distal (proximal+distal) failure, removal for infection, externalization for abdominal pseudocyst, and addition of a ventricular catheter for loculated hydrocephalus.


RESULTS
A total of 232 VP shunts were included in the final analysis, 115 DSV shunts and 117 CV shunts. There was no difference in the overall failure rate or time to failure between the two groups, and the follow-up period was statistically similar between the groups. The DSV group had a failure rate of 54% and a mean time to failure of 17.8 months. The CV group had a failure rate of 50% (p = 0.50) and a mean time to failure of 18.5 months (p = 0.56). The overall shunt survival curves for these two groups were similar; however, the location of failure was significantly different between the two groups. Shunts with DSVs had proportionately more distal failures than the CV group (34% vs 14%, respectively, p = 0.009). DSV shunts were also found to have proximal+distal catheter occlusions more frequently than CV shunts (23% vs 5%, respectively, p = 0.005). CV shunts were found to have significantly more proximal failures than the DSV shunts (53% vs 27%, p = 0.028). However, the only failure type that carried a statistically significant adjusted hazard ratio in a multivariate analysis was proximal+distal catheter obstruction (CV vs DSV shunt: HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.81).


CONCLUSIONS
There appears to be a difference in the location of catheter obstruction leading to the malfunction of shunts with DSVs compared to shunts with CVs; however, overall shunt survival is similar between the two. These failure types are also affected by other factors such etiology of hydrocephalus and endoscope use. The implications of these findings are unclear, and this topic warrants further investigation.",Alex D Waldman;Pavlos Texakalidis;Bryan Buster;Sheila R Eshraghi;Jennifer Wheelus;Andrew Reisner;Joshua J Chern

Isolated, nondisplaced skull fractures (ISFs) are a common result of pediatric head trauma. They rarely require surgical intervention; however, many patients with these injuries are still admitted to the hospital for observation. This retrospective study investigates predictors of vomiting and ondansetron use following pediatric ISFs and the role that these factors play in the need for admission and emergency department (ED) revisits.


METHODS
The authors identified pediatric patients (< 18 years old) with a linear ISF who had presented to the ED of a single tertiary care center between 2008 and 2018. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage, significant fracture displacement, or other traumatic injuries were excluded. Outcomes included vomiting, ondansetron use, admission, and revisit following ED discharge. Both univariable and multivariable analyses were used to determine significant predictors of each outcome (p < 0.05).


RESULTS
Overall, 518 patients were included in this study. The median patient age was 9.98 months, and a majority of the patients (59%) were male. The most common fracture locations were parietal (n = 293 [57%]) and occipital (n = 144 [28%]). Among the entire patient cohort, 124 patients (24%) had documented vomiting, and 64 of these patients (52%) received ondansetron. In a multivariable analysis, one of the most significant predictors of vomiting was occipital fracture location (OR 4.05, p < 0.001). In turn, and as expected, both vomiting (OR 14.42, p < 0.001) and occipital fracture location (OR 2.66, p = 0.017) were associated with increased rates of ondansetron use. A total of 229 patients (44%) were admitted to the hospital, with vomiting as the most common indication for admission (n = 59 [26%]). Moreover, 4.1% of the patients had ED revisits following initial discharge, and the most common reason was vomiting (11/21 [52%]). However, in the multivariable analysis, ondansetron use at initial presentation (and not vomiting) was the sole predictor of revisit following initial ED discharge (OR 5.05, p = 0.009).


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, older patients and those with occipital fractures were more likely to present with vomiting and to be treated with ondansetron. Additionally, ondansetron use at initial presentation was found to be a significant predictor of revisits following ED discharge. Ondansetron could be masking recurrent vomiting in ED patients, and this should be considered when deciding which patients to observe further or discharge.",Evan Mercer;Rebecca A Reynolds;John C Wellons;Chevis N Shannon;Christopher M Bonfield
971,Lauren Harris,"Cervical disc arthroplasty is a treatment option for symptomatic cervical disc disease. There is a paucity of literature on long-term safety outcomes, durability, and device-related failure rates. The M6-C artificial cervical disc is a device with titanium alloy endplates and a complex polymeric centerpiece. To date, trials have exhibited acceptable safety profiles.This case series describes the presentation, management, and pathological findings of a delayed prevertebral periprosthetic mass anterior to the M6-C disc. Four patients at 3 different institutions underwent cervical disc replacement with the M6-C disc. Two to seven years postoperatively, they presented with dysphagia secondary to a compressive mass anterior to the disc. Case notes were reviewed to collect data on symptoms, management, and outcomes. The patients were systemically well and presented with progressive dysphagia. They had imaging findings of a mass anterior to the disc. They underwent a decompressive procedure, with 2 patients undergoing device removal and fusion. In 2 cases, a soft-tissue mass was seen intraoperatively, with frank pus. In 3 cases, Propionibacterium acnes was identified and antibiotic treatment given. Histopathology demonstrated mixed inflammatory infiltrates with foreign body-type granulomas. Postoperatively, the dysphagia resolved.The development of delayed dysphagia in a patient with an M6-C disc should prompt investigation to identify a mass lesion. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of delayed infection, or suspected delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, following M6-C disc implantation. It is important for this to be added to the device safety concerns. Further prospective studies are needed to establish the incidence and the long-term safety and failure rates of the M6-C disc.",Edward Dyson;Matthew Elliot;David Peterson;Christian Ulbricht;Adrian Casey
972,Ryuta Matsuoka,"OBJECTIVE
False-positive intraoperative muscle motor evoked potential (mMEP) monitoring results due to systemic effects of anesthetics and physiological changes continue to be a challenging issue. Although control MEPs recorded from the unaffected side are useful for identifying a true-positive signal, there are no muscles on the upper or lower extremities to induce control MEPs in cervical spine surgery. Therefore, this study was conducted to clarify if additional MEPs derived from facial muscles can feasibly serve as controls to reduce false-positive mMEP monitoring results in cervical spine surgery.


METHODS
Patients who underwent cervical spine surgery at the authors' institution who did not experience postoperative neurological deterioration were retrospectively studied. mMEPs were induced with transcranial supramaximal stimulation. Facial MEPs (fMEPs) were subsequently induced with suprathreshold stimulation. The mMEP and subsequently recorded fMEP waveforms were paired during each moment during surgery. The initial pair was regarded as the baseline. A significant decline in mMEP and fMEP amplitude was defined as > 80% and > 50% decline compared with baseline, respectively. All mMEP alarms were considered false positives. Based on 2 different alarm criteria, either mMEP alone or both mMEP and fMEP, rates of false-positive mMEP monitoring results were calculated.


RESULTS
Twenty-three patients were included in this study, corresponding to 102 pairs of mMEPs and fMEPs. This included 23 initial and 79 subsequent pairs. Based on the alarm criterion of mMEP alone, 17 false-positive results (21.5%) were observed. Based on the alarm criterion of both mMEP and fMEP, 5 false-positive results (6.3%) were observed, which was significantly different compared to mMEP alone (difference 15.2%; 95% CI 7.2%-23.1%; p < 0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
fMEPs might be used as controls to reduce false-positive mMEP monitoring results in cervical spine surgery.",Yasuhiro Takeshima;Hironobu Hayashi;Tsunenori Takatani;Fumihiko Nishimura;Ichiro Nakagawa;Yasushi Motoyama;Young-Su Park;Masahiko Kawaguchi;Hiroyuki Nakase
973,Gulden Demirci Otluoglu,"The evaluation of spinal cord vascular malformations in neuroradiology departments remains valid for both diagnosis and endovascular embolization, and for adjuvant as well as definitive treatment. The most commonly encountered complications of endovascular approaches are the recurrence or the incomplete embolization of the lesion and accidental damage to the medullary arteries, which leads to spinal cord infarction. Failure to remember a microcatheter in the abdominal aorta after catheterization is an underestimated complication. A retained guidewire in the circulation may not necessarily cause symptoms, and it may remain unnoticed for a significant period of time. However, severe complications may be faced even many years later. In this article, a case report on a fracture and migration of a retained microcatheter in the cauda equina is presented. This occurred after an endovascular neurointervention for dural arteriovenous fistula as a rare cause of tethered spinal cord.",Teyyub Hasanov;Basak Mert;Zafer Orkun Toktas;Deniz Konya;Mustafa Kemal Demir
974,Jarod L Roland,"OBJECTIVE
Corpus callosotomy is a palliative procedure that is effective at reducing seizure burden in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. The procedure is traditionally performed via open craniotomy with interhemispheric microdissection to divide the corpus callosum. Concerns for morbidity associated with craniotomy can be a deterrent to patients, families, and referring physicians for surgical treatment of epilepsy. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a less invasive procedure that has been widely adopted in neurosurgery for the treatment of tumors. In this study, the authors investigated LITT as a less invasive approach for corpus callosotomy.


METHODS
The authors retrospectively reviewed all patients treated for medically refractory epilepsy by corpus callosotomy, either partial or completion, with LITT. Chart records were analyzed to summarize procedural metrics, length of stay, adverse events, seizure outcomes, and time to follow-up. In select cases, resting-state functional MRI was performed to qualitatively support effective functional disconnection of the cerebral hemispheres.


RESULTS
Ten patients underwent 11 LITT procedures. Five patients received an anterior two-thirds LITT callosotomy as their first procedure. One patient returned after LITT partial callosotomy for completion of callosotomy by LITT. The median hospital stay was 2 days (IQR 1.5-3 days), and the mean follow-up time was 1.0 year (range 1 month to 2.86 years). Functional outcomes are similar to those of open callosotomy, with the greatest effect in patients with a significant component of drop attacks in their seizure semiology. One patient achieved an Engel class II outcome after anterior two-thirds callosotomy resulting in only rare seizures at the 18-month follow-up. Four others were in Engel class III and 5 were Engel class IV. Hemorrhage occurred in 1 patient at the time of removal of the laser fiber, which was placed through the bone flap of a prior open partial callosotomy.


CONCLUSIONS
LITT appears to be a safe and effective means for performing corpus callosotomy. Additional data are needed to confirm equipoise between open craniotomy and LITT for corpus callosotomy.",Syed Hassan A Akbari;Afshin Salehi;Matthew D Smyth
975,Rei Yamaguchi,"OBJECTIVE
Visual acuity impairment due to sellar and suprasellar tumors is not fully understood. The relationship between these tumors and disturbance of visual function was examined using preoperative MRI.


METHODS
This study reviewed 93 consecutive patients with sellar and suprasellar tumors. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and visual impairment score (VIS) were used for estimation of visual impairments. Preoperative MR images were examined to obtain several values for estimation of chiasmatic compression. Additionally, the optic nerve-canal bending angle (ONCBA) was newly defined as the external angle formed by the optic nerve in the optic canal and the optic nerve in the intracranial subarachnoid space at the junction, using preoperative sagittal T2-weighted MR images.


RESULTS
The mean ONCBA was about the same on the right (44° ± 25°) and the left (44° ± 24°). Sagittal ONCBA was defined as large (> 45°) and moderate (≤ 45°) on each side. Preoperative VIS was found to be significantly worse if the right or left ONCBA (or both) was large (right side: ONCBA large [median 20, IQR 8-30] > ONCBA moderate [median 10, IQR 3-17], p = 0.003, Mann-Whitney U-test; left side: ONCBA large [median 22, IQR 9-30] > ONCBA moderate [median 10, IQR 2-16], p = 0.001). A large ONCBA showed a significant relationship with unfavorable ipsilateral BCVA (> logMAR, 0; right side, p = 0.001, left side, p = 0.001, chi-square test). The ONCBA had a positive correlation with ipsilateral BCVA (right: r = 0.297, p = 0.031; left: r = 0.451, p = 0.000, Pearson's correlation coefficient). Preoperative BCVA was significantly lower on the same side in the large ONCBA group compared with the moderate ONCBA group (right side: large ONCBA 0.169 ± 0.333 [logMAR, mean ± standard deviation] vs moderate ONCBA 0.045 ± 0.359, p = 0.026, Student t-test; left side: large ONCBA 0.245 ± 0.346 vs moderate ONCBA 0.025 ± 0.333, p = 0.000). This visual acuity impairment improved after resection of the tumors.


CONCLUSIONS
Sagittal bending of the optic nerve at the entrance from the intracranial subarachnoid space to the optic canal may be related to ipsilateral deterioration of visual acuity in sellar and suprasellar lesions. Sagittal T2-weighted MRI is recommended for preoperative estimation of the optic nerve bending.",Masahiko Tosaka;Takaaki Miyagishima;Tadashi Osawa;Keishi Horiguchi;Fumiaki Honda;Yuhei Yoshimoto
976,Minghao Wang,"OBJECTIVE
Both structural allograft and PEEK have been used for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). There are reports that PEEK has a higher pseudarthrosis rate than structural allograft. The authors compared pseudarthrosis, revision, subsidence, and loss of lordosis rates in patients with PEEK and structural allograft.


METHODS
The authors performed a retrospective review of patients who were treated with ACDF at their hospital between 2005 and 2017. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with either PEEK or structural allograft, anterior plate fixation, and a minimum 2-year follow-up. Exclusion criteria were hybrid PEEK and allograft cases, additional posterior surgery, adjacent corpectomies, infection, tumor, stand-alone or integrated screw and cage devices, bone morphogenetic protein use, or lack of a minimum 2-year follow-up. Demographic variables, number of treated levels, interbody type (PEEK cage vs structural allograft), graft packing material, pseudarthrosis rates, revision surgery rates, subsidence, and cervical lordosis changes were collected. These data were analyzed by Pearson's chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test, according to the sample size and expected value) and Student t-test.


RESULTS
A total of 168 patients (264 levels total, mean follow-up time 39.5 ± 24.0 months) were analyzed. Sixty-one patients had PEEK, and 107 patients had structural allograft. Pseudarthrosis rates for 1-level fusions were 5.4% (PEEK) and 3.4% (allograft) (p > 0.05); 2-level fusions were 7.1% (PEEK) and 8.1% (allograft) (p > 0.05); and ≥ 3-level fusions were 10% (PEEK) and 11.1% (allograft) (p > 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the subsidence magnitude between PEEK and allograft in 1-, 2-, and ≥ 3-level ACDF (p > 0.05). Postoperative lordosis loss was not different between cohorts for 1- and 2-level surgeries.


CONCLUSIONS
In 1- and 2-level ACDF with plating involving the same number of fusion levels, there was no statistically significant difference in the pseudarthrosis rate, revision surgery rate, subsidence, and lordosis loss between PEEK cages and structural allograft.",Dean Chou;Chih-Chang Chang;Ankit Hirpara;Yilin Liu;Andrew K Chan;Brenton Pennicooke;Praveen V Mummaneni
977,Amy K Bruzek,"OBJECTIVE
The nature of the relationship between spinal cord syrinx and tethered cord is not well known. It is unclear if surgical cord untethering results in resolution or improvement of an associated syrinx. The objective of this study was to report the response of spinal cord syrinx to surgical cord untethering.


METHODS
The authors retrospectively reviewed all patients with a syrinx and tethered cord who presented to a single institution over an 11-year interval. Patients with open neural tube defects were excluded. Thirty-one patients were identified, 25 of whom had both clinical and imaging follow-up after surgery. Patients were grouped according to etiology of the tethered cord. Clinical outcomes and syrinx characteristics were recorded.


RESULTS
Of the 25 patients with tethered cord, 68% (n = 17) were male. The average age at presentation was 2.5 years (0-10.1 years) and age at surgery was 3.7 years (range 1 day to 17 years). Etiologies of tethered cord were lipomyelomeningocele (n = 8), thickened/fatty filum (n = 7), intradural lipoma (n = 5), myelocystocele (n = 2), meningocele (n = 2), and diastematomyelia (n = 1). Twenty-three of the patients underwent primary untethering, whereas 2 patients had received untethering previously at another institution. The average syrinx length and width prior to surgery were 4.81 vertebral levels (SD 4.35) and 5.19 mm (SD 2.55 mm), respectively. Conus level ranged from L1 to S3. Patients were followed for an average of 8.4 years (1.35-15.85 years). Overall there was no significant change in syrinx length or width postoperatively; the average syrinx length increased by 0.86 vertebral levels (SD 4.36) and width decreased by 0.72 mm (SD 2.94 mm). Seven of 25 patients had improvement in at least one presenting symptom, including scoliosis, weakness, bowel/bladder dysfunction, and pain. Eight patients had stable presenting symptoms. Six patients were asymptomatic and 5 patients had new or worsening symptoms, which included scoliosis, pain, or sensory changes.


CONCLUSIONS
Although some syrinxes improved after surgery for tethered cord, radiological improvement was not consistent and did not appear to be associated with change in clinical symptoms. The decision to surgically untether a cord should be focused on the clinical symptoms and not the presence of a syrinx alone. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding.",Jordan Starr;Hugh J L Garton;Karin M Muraszko;Cormac O Maher;Jennifer M Strahle
978,Kishan Patel,"OBJECTIVE
Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) is characterized by congenital fusion of the cervical vertebrae. Due to its rarity, minimal research has been done to assess the quality and management of pain associated with this disorder. Using a large global database, the authors report a detailed analysis of the type, location, and treatment of pain in patients with KFS.


METHODS
Data were obtained from the Coordination of Rare Diseases at Stanford registry and Klippel-Feil Syndrome Freedom registry. The cervical fusions were categorized into Samartzis type I, II, or III. The independent-sample t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and Friedman test were conducted, with significance set at p < 0.05.


RESULTS
Seventy-five patients (60 female, 14 male, and 1 unknown) were identified and classified as having the following types of Samartzis fusion: type I, n = 21 (28%); type II, n = 15 (20%); type III, n = 39 (52%). Seventy participants (93.3%) experienced pain associated with their KFS. The median age of patients at pain onset was 16.0 years (IQR 6.75-24.0 years), and the median age when pain worsened was 28.0 years (IQR 15.25-41.5 years). Muscle, joint, and nerve pain was primarily located in the shoulders/upper back (76%), neck (72%), and back of head (50.7%) and was characterized as tightness (73%), dull/aching (67%), and tingling/pins and needles (49%). Type III fusions were significantly associated with greater nerve pain (p = 0.02), headache/migraine pain (p = 0.02), and joint pain (p = 0.03) compared to other types of fusion. Patients with cervical fusions in the middle region (C2-6) tended to report greater muscle, joint, and nerve pain (p = 0.06). Participants rated the effectiveness of oral over-the-counter medications as 3 of 5 (IQR 1-3), oral prescribed medications as 3 of 5 (IQR 2-4), injections as 2 of 5 (IQR 1-4), and surgery as 3 of 5 (IQR 1-4), with 0 indicating the least pain relief and 5 the most pain relief. Participants who pursued surgical treatment reported significantly more comorbidities (p = 0.02) and neurological symptoms (p = 0.01) than nonsurgically treated participants and were significantly older when pain worsened (p = 0.03), but there was no difference in levels of muscle, joint, or nerve pain (p = 0.32); headache/migraine pain (p = 0.35); total number of cervical fusions (p = 0.77); location of fusions; or age at pain onset (p = 0.16).


CONCLUSIONS
More than 90% of participants experienced pain. Participants with an increased number of overall cervical fusions or multilevel, contiguous fusions reported greater levels of muscle, joint, and nerve pain. Participants who pursued surgery had more comorbidities and neurological symptoms, such as balance and gait disturbances, but did not report more significant pain than nonsurgically treated participants.",Hardy Evans;Samuel Sommaruga;Pia Vayssiere;Tariq Qureshi;Luis Kolb;Michael G Fehlings;Joseph S Cheng;Enrico Tessitore;Karl Schaller;Aria Nouri
979,Nadieh Khalili,"MR images of infants and fetuses allow non-invasive analysis of the brain. Quantitative analysis of brain development requires automatic brain tissue segmentation that is typically preceded by segmentation of the intracranial volume (ICV). Fast changes in the size and morphology of the developing brain, motion artifacts, and large variation in the field of view make ICV segmentation a challenging task. We propose an automatic method for segmentation of the ICV in fetal and neonatal MRI scans. The method was developed and tested with a diverse set of scans regarding image acquisition parameters (i.e. field strength, image acquisition plane, image resolution), infant age (23-45 weeks post menstrual age), and pathology (posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilatation, stroke, asphyxia, and Down syndrome). The results demonstrate that the method achieves accurate segmentation with a Dice coefficient (DC) ranging from 0.98 to 0.99 in neonatal and fetal scans regardless of image acquisition parameters or patient characteristics. Hence, the algorithm provides a generic tool for segmentation of the ICV that may be used as a preprocessing step for brain tissue segmentation in fetal and neonatal brain MR scans.",E Turk;M J N L Benders;P Moeskops;N H P Claessens;R de Heus;A Franx;N Wagenaar;J M P J Breur;M A Viergever;I Išgum
980,Jun Guo,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Early studies have indicated that the cortico-rubro-spinal tracts play important roles in motor dysfunction after stroke. However, the differential involvement of the rubral branches in capsular and pontine stroke, and their associations with the motor impairment are still unknown.


METHODS
The present study recruited 144 chronic stroke patients and 91 normal controls (NC) from three hospitals, including 102 cases with capsular stroke (CS) and 42 cases with pontine stroke (PS). The rubral branches, including bilateral corticorubral tracts (CRT), dentatorubral tracts (DRT), and rubrospinal tracts (RST), and the cortico-spinal tract (CST) were reconstructed based on the dataset of the Human Connectome Project. Group differences in diffusion scalars of each rubral branch were compared, and the associations between the diffusion measures of rubral branches and the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) scores were tested.


RESULTS
The bilateral CRT of the CS cases showed significantly lower factional anisotropy (FA) than in the NC. The bilateral DRT of the PS cases had lower FA than in the NC. Both CS and PS cases had significantly lower FA of the bilateral RST than the NC. Besides, the stroke patients demonstrated significantly lower FA in bilateral CSTs than the NC. Partial correlation analysis identified significantly positive correlations between the FA of the ipsilesional and CRT and the FMA scores in the CS group, and significantly positive correlations between the FA of the RST bilaterally and the FMA scores in the CS and PS groups. Furthermore, the association between RST integrity and FMA scores still survived after controlling for the effect of the CST. Finally, multiple regression modelling found that rubral tract FA explained 39.2% of the variance in FMA scores for CS patients, and 48.8% of the variance in FMA scores for PS patients.


CONCLUSIONS
The bilateral rubral branches were differentially involved in the chronic capsular and pontine stroke, and the impairment severity of each rubral branch was dependent on lesion locations. The integrity of the rubral branches is related to motor impairment in both the chronic capsular and pontine stroke.",Jingchun Liu;Caihong Wang;Chen Cao;Lejun Fu;Tong Han;Jingliang Cheng;Chunshui Yu;Wen Qin
981,Tiffany A Kolesar,"OBJECTIVE
To compare structure, functional connectivity (FC) and task-based neural differences in subjects with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) compared to healthy controls (HC).


METHODS
The Embase, Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception until March 12, 2018. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Data were extracted from records directly contrasting GAD and HC that included structure (connectivity and local indices such as volume, etc.), FC, or task-based magnetic resonance imaging data. Meta-analyses were conducted, as applicable, using AES-SDM software.


RESULTS
The literature search produced 4,645 total records, of which 85 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Records included structural (n = 35), FC (n = 33), and task-based (n = 42) findings. Meta-analyses were conducted on voxel-based morphometry and task-based results.


DISCUSSION
The systematic review confirms and extends findings from previous reviews. Although few whole-brain resting state studies were conducted, key nodes of resting state networks have altered physiology: the hippocampus (default network), ACC and amygdala (salience network), have reduced volume, and the dlPFC (central executive network) and ACC have reduced FC with the amygdala in GAD. Nodes in the sensorimotor network are also altered with greater pre- and postcentral volume, reduced supplementary motor area volume, and reduced FC in anterior and increased FC in posterior cerebellum.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite limitations due to sample size, the meta-analyses highly agree with the systematic review and provide evidence of widely distributed neural differences in subjects with GAD, compared to HC. Further research optimized for meta-analyses would greatly improve large-scale comparisons.",Elena Bilevicius;Alyssia D Wilson;Jennifer Kornelsen
982,Carole H Sudre,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders with both sporadic and genetic forms. Mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are a common cause of genetic FTD, causing either a behavioural presentation or, less commonly, language impairment. Presence on T2-weighted images of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) has been previously shown to be more commonly associated with GRN mutations rather than other forms of FTD. The aim of the current study was to investigate the longitudinal change in WMH and the associations of WMH burden with grey matter (GM) loss, markers of neurodegeneration and cognitive function in GRN mutation carriers. 336 participants in the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI) study were included in the analysis: 101 presymptomatic and 32 symptomatic GRN mutation carriers, as well as 203 mutation-negative controls. 39 presymptomatic and 12 symptomatic carriers, and 73 controls also had longitudinal data available. Participants underwent MR imaging acquisition including isotropic 1 mm T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences. WMH were automatically segmented and locally subdivided to enable a more detailed representation of the pathology distribution. Log-transformed WMH volumes were investigated in terms of their global and regional associations with imaging measures (grey matter volumes), biomarker concentrations (plasma neurofilament light chain, NfL, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP), genetic status (TMEM106B risk genotype) and cognition (tests of executive function). Analyses revealed that WMH load was higher in both symptomatic and presymptomatic groups compared with controls and this load increased over time. In particular, lesions were seen periventricularly in frontal and occipital lobes, progressing to medial layers over time. However, there was variability in the WMH load across GRN mutation carriers - in the symptomatic group 25.0% had none/mild load, 37.5% had medium and 37.5% had a severe load - a difference not fully explained by disease duration. GM atrophy was strongly associated with WMH load both globally and in separate lobes, and increased WMH burden in the frontal, periventricular and medial regions was associated with worse executive function. Furthermore, plasma NfL and to a lesser extent GFAP concentrations were seen to be associated with increased lesion burden. Lastly, the presence of the homozygous TMEM106B rs1990622 TT risk genotypic status was associated with an increased accrual of WMH per year. In summary, WMH occur in GRN mutation carriers and accumulate over time, but are variable in their severity. They are associated with increased GM atrophy and executive dysfunction. Furthermore, their presence is associated with markers of WM damage (NfL) and astrocytosis (GFAP), whilst their accrual is modified by TMEM106B genetic status. WMH load may represent a target marker for trials of disease modifying therapies in individual patients but the variability across the GRN population would prevent use of such markers as a global outcome measure across all participants in a trial.",Martina Bocchetta;Carolin Heller;Rhian Convery;Mollie Neason;Katrina M Moore;David M Cash;David L Thomas;Ione O C Woollacott;Martha Foiani;Amanda Heslegrave;Rachelle Shafei;Caroline Greaves;John van Swieten;Fermin Moreno;Raquel Sanchez-Valle;Barbara Borroni;Robert Laforce;Mario Masellis;Maria Carmela Tartaglia;Caroline Graff;Daniela Galimberti;James B Rowe;Elizabeth Finger;Matthis Synofzik;Rik Vandenberghe;Alexandre de Mendonça;Fabrizio Tagliavini;Isabel Santana;Simon Ducharme;Chris Butler;Alex Gerhard;Johannes Levin;Adrian Danek;Giovanni B Frisoni;Sandro Sorbi;Markus Otto;Henrik Zetterberg;Sebastien Ourselin;M Jorge Cardoso;Jonathan D Rohrer; 
983,Hans E Atlason,"White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) of presumed vascular origin are frequently observed in magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the elderly. Detection and quantification of WMHs is important to help doctors make diagnoses and evaluate prognosis of their elderly patients, and once quantified, these can act as biomarkers in clinical research studies. Manual delineation of WMHs can be both time-consuming and inconsistent, hence, automatic segmentation methods are often preferred. However, fully automatic methods can be challenging to construct due to the variability in lesion load, placement of lesions, and voxel intensities. Several state-of-the-art lesion segmentation methods based on supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed. These approaches require manually delineated lesions for training the parameters of the network. Here we present a novel approach for WMH segmentation using a CNN trained in an unsupervised manner, by reconstructing multiple MRI sequences as weighted sums of segmentations of WMHs and tissues present in the images. After training, our method can be used to segment new images that are not part of the training set to provide fast and robust segmentation of WMHs in a matter of seconds per subject. Comparisons with state-of-the-art WMH segmentation methods evaluated on ground truth manual labels from two distinct data sets and six different scanners indicate that the proposed method works well at generating accurate WMH segmentations without the need for manual delineations.",Askell Love;Sigurdur Sigurdsson;Vilmundur Gudnason;Lotta M Ellingsen
984,Lei Gao,"Severe (>70% narrowing) asymptomatic carotid stenosis (SACS) is associated with cognitive impairment and future strokes, and connectivity basis for the remote brain consequences is poorly understood. Here we explored homotopic connectivity and parenchymal lesions measured by multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters in patients with SACS. Twenty-four patients with SACS (19 males/5 females; 64.25 ± 7.18 years), 24 comorbidities-matched controls (19 males/5 females; 67.16 ± 6.10 years), and an independent sample of elderly healthy controls (39 females/45 males; 57.92 ± 4.94 years) were included. Homotopic functional connectivity (FC) of resting-state functional MRI and structural connectivity (SC) of deterministic tractography were assessed. Arterial spin labeling based cerebral perfusion, susceptibility weighted imaging based microhemorrhagic lesions, and T2-weighted white matter hyperintensities were also quantified. Significant and robust homotopic reductions (validated by the independent dataset and support vector machine-based machine learning) were identified in the Perisylvian fissure in patients with SACS (false discovery rate corrected, voxel p < 0.05). These involved regions span across several large-scale brain systems, which include the somatomotor, salience, dorsal attention, and orbitofrontal-limbic networks. This significantly reduced homotopic FC can be partially explained by the corrected white matter hyperintensity size. Further association analyses suggest that the decreased homotopic FC in these brain regions is most closely associated with delayed memory recall, sensorimotor processing, and other simple cognitive functions. Together, these results suggest that SACS predominately affects the lower-order brain systems, while higher-order systems, especially the topographies of default mode network, are least impacted initially, but may serve as a hallmark precursor to vascular dementia. Thus, assessment of homotopic FC may provide a means of noninvasively tracking the progression of downstream brain damage following asymptomatic carotid stenosis.",Tao Wang;Tianyi Qian;Feng Xiao;Lijun Bai;Junjian Zhang;Haibo Xu

Children with brain injury have shown deficits identifying even basic emotions from facial expression, yet few intervention studies have explored how to develop facial expression recognition in children with brain injury. Enhancing the ability to recognize and interpret facial expressions for these children would have implications for their emotional processing and social-emotional behavior. In this paper we report on a short single case study intervention to increase facial expression recognition using the Facial Affect Recognition training (FAR) for a 10-year-old-child with brain injury. Following intervention, there was not only an increase in facial expression recognition but also changes in social-emotional behavior indicating some generalization to other contexts. The results suggest that rehabilitation of emotional processing difficulties may indeed be possible, and further intervention studies aimed at developing these skills in children with brain injury are warranted.",Tatiana Leal Amore;W Huw Williams;James Tonks
986,Johanna Messerly,"The Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) and Word Memory Test (WMT) are among the most well-known performance validity tests (PVTs) and regarded as gold standard measures. Due to the many factors that impact PVT selection, it is imperative that clinicians make informed clinical decisions with respect to additional or alternative PVTs that demonstrate similar classification accuracy as these well-validated measures. The present archival study evaluated the agreement/classification accuracy of a large battery consisting of multiple other freestanding/embedded PVTs in a mixed clinical sample of 126 veterans. We examined failure rates for all standalone/embedded PVTs using established cut-scores and calculated pass/fail agreement rates and diagnostic odds ratios for various combinations of PVTs using the TOMM and WMT as criterion measures. TOMM and WMT demonstrated the best agreement, followed by Word Choice Test (WCT). The Rey Fifteen Item Test had an excessive number of false-negative errors and reduced classification accuracy. The Digit Span age-corrected scaled score (DS-ACSS) had highest agreement. Findings lend further support to the use of a combination of embedded and standalone PVTs in identifying suboptimal performance. Results provide data to enhance clinical decision making for neuropsychologists who implement combinations of PVTs in a larger clinical battery.",Jason R Soble;Troy A Webber;W Alex Alverson;Chrystal Fullen;Lindsay D Kraemer;Janice C Marceaux

988,Anna S Ord,"Neuropsychological literature has demonstrated a significant relationship between cognitive decline and functional capacity, but the directionality of this relationship is still not well understood. Further, the construct of practical judgment has been linked to both cognitive impairment and functional capacity, but these associations are still under-researched. Moreover, few studies to date have examined the relationships among all three constructs utilizing performance-based, ecologically valid and psychometrically sound measures. The present study aimed to address this gap in published literature and investigated whether a practical judgment and functional capacity can help differentiate individuals with cognitive dysfunction from those without. Participants were 270 community-dwelling individuals aged 56-95 years referred for neuropsychological evaluation in an outpatient setting. Bivariate correlations revealed moderate to strong relationships among the three studied variables. Additionally, logistic regression analysis indicated that ability to make sound practical judgments and ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can be used as indicators of cognitive impairment. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",Jacob I Phillips;Trevor Wolterstorff;Rebekah Kintzing;Sue-Mei Slogar;Scott W Sautter
989,Mudan Cai,"BACKGROUND
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of cognitive abilities and memory leading to dementia. Electroacupuncture (EA) is a complementary alternative medicine approach, applying an electrical current to acupuncture points. In clinical and animal studies, EA causes cognitive improvements in AD and vascular dementia. However, EA-induced changes in cognition and microglia-mediated amyloid β (Aβ) degradation have not been determined yet in AD animals. Therefore, this study investigated the EA-induced molecular mechanisms causing cognitive improvement and anti-inflammatory activity in five familial mutation (5XFAD) mice, an animal model of AD.


METHODS
5XFAD mice were bilaterally treated with EA at the Taegye (KI3) acupoints three times per week for 2 weeks. To evaluate the effects of EA treatment on cognitive functions, novel object recognition and Y-maze tests were performed with non-Tg, 5XFAD (Tg), and EA-treated 5XFAD (Tg + KI3) mice. To examine the molecular mechanisms underlying EA effects, western blots, immunohistochemistry, and micro-positron emission tomography scans were performed. Furthermore, we studied synapse ultrastructures with transmission electron microscopy and used electrophysiology to investigate EA effects on synaptic plasticity in 5XFAD mice.


RESULTS
EA treatment significantly improved working memory and synaptic plasticity, alleviated neuroinflammation, and reduced ultrastructural degradation of synapses via upregulation of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density-95 protein in 5XFAD mice. Furthermore, microglia-mediated Aβ deposition was reduced after EA treatment and coincided with a reduction in amyloid precursor protein.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrate that EA treatment ameliorates cognitive impairment via inhibition of synaptic degeneration and neuroinflammation in a mouse model of AD.",Jun-Hwan Lee;Eun Jin Yang

New intraoperative imaging techniques, which aim to improve tumour resection, have been implemented in recent years in brain tumour surgery, although they lead to an increase in resources. In order to carry out an update on this topic, this manuscript has been drafted by a group from the Sociedad Española de Neurocirugía (Spanish Society of Neurosurgery).


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Experts in the use of each one of the most-used intraoperative techniques in brain tumour surgery were presented with a description of the technique and a brief review of the literature. Indications for use, their advantages and disadvantages based on clinical experience and on what is published in the literature will be described.


RESULTS
The most robust intraoperative imaging technique appears to be low- and high-field magnetic resonance imaging, but this is the technique which results in the greatest expenditure. Intraoperative ultrasound navigation is portable and less expensive, but it provides poorer differentiation of high-grade tumours and is observer-dependent. The most-used fluorescence techniques are 5-aminolevulinic acid for high-grade gliomas and fluorescein, useful in lesions which rupture the blood-brain barrier. Last of all, intraoperative CT is more versatile in the neurosurgery operating theatre, but it has fewer indications in neuro-oncology surgery.


CONCLUSIONS
Intraoperative imaging techniques are used with increasingly greater frequency in brain tumour surgery, and the neurosurgeon should assess their possible use depending on their resources and the needs of each patient.",Cristian de Quintana Schmidt;Josep Gonzalez Sánchez;Ignacio Fernández Portales;Marta Del Álamo de Pedro;Victor Rodríguez Berrocal;Ricardo Díez Valle; 
991,Chinnakkaruppan Adaikkan,"Studies have shown that gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) are relevant for neurocircuit function, behavior, and memory. To examine a possible causal contribution of gamma oscillations to cognitive function, recent studies have employed various types of brain stimulation to induce gamma oscillations. Techniques such as optogenetics or sensory stimulation appear to engage canonical neurocircuits that encompass excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, similarly to those driven by sensory experience, to induce gamma entrainment. Sensory evoked gamma entrainment improves cognitive function in mouse models. Oscillations have traditionally been studied at the neurophysiological level; however, sensory evoked gamma entrainment is able to induce gene expression changes in multiple cell types including neurons and microglia. Furthermore, evidence suggests that chronic gamma entrainment offers neuroprotective effects.",Li-Huei Tsai

However, there might be conditions in which brain activity supports consciousness even when that activity is fully causally isolated from the body and its environment. Such cases would involve what we call islands of awareness: conscious states that are neither shaped by sensory input nor able to be expressed by motor output. This opinion article considers conditions in which such islands might occur, including ex cranio brains, hemispherotomy, and in cerebral organoids. We examine possible methods for detecting islands of awareness, and consider their implications for ethics and for the nature of consciousness.",Anil K Seth;Marcello Massimini

Using precision functional mapping-individual-specific analysis of highly sampled human participants-we investigated individual-specific functional connectivity between subcortical structures and cortical functional networks. This approach revealed distinct subcortical zones of network specificity and multi-network integration. Integration zones were systematic, with convergence of cingulo-opercular control and somatomotor networks in the ventral intermediate thalamus (motor integration zones), dorsal attention and visual networks in the pulvinar, and default mode and multiple control networks in the caudate nucleus. The motor integration zones were present in every individual and correspond to consistently successful sites of deep brain stimulation (DBS; essential tremor). Individually variable subcortical zones correspond to DBS sites with less consistent treatment effects, highlighting the importance of PFM for neurosurgery, neurology, and psychiatry.",Scott Marek;Evan M Gordon;Joshua S Siegel;Caterina Gratton;Timothy O Laumann;Adrian W Gilmore;Jeffrey J Berg;Annie L Nguyen;Donna Dierker;Andrew N Van;Mario Ortega;Dillan J Newbold;Jacqueline M Hampton;Ashley N Nielsen;Kathleen B McDermott;Jarod L Roland;Scott A Norris;Steven M Nelson;Abraham Z Snyder;Bradley L Schlaggar;Steven E Petersen;Nico U F Dosenbach
994,Seng Bum Michael Yoo,"Economic choice proceeds from evaluation, in which we contemplate options, to selection, in which we weigh options and choose one. These stages must be differentiated so that decision makers do not proceed to selection before evaluation is complete. We examined responses of neurons in two core reward regions, orbitofrontal (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), during two-option choice with asynchronous offer presentation. Our data suggest that neurons selective during the first (presumed evaluation) and second (presumed comparison and selection) offer epochs come from a single pool. Stage transition is accompanied by a shift toward orthogonality in the low-dimensional population response manifold. Nonetheless, the relative position of each option in driving responses in the population subspace is preserved. The orthogonalization we observe supports the hypothesis that the transition from evaluation to selection leads to reorganization of response subspace and suggests a mechanism by which value-related signals are prevented from prematurely driving choice.",Benjamin Y Hayden

Congenital ataxias associated with cerebellar atrophy are clinically heterogeneous conditions with a variable age of onset and a diverse molecular basis. The hypothesis-free approach of genomic sequencing has led to the discovery of new genes implicated in these disorders and the identification of unexpected genotype-phenotype correlations. Although a recurrent heterozygous mutation (p.Arg1715His) in CACNA1G is known to cause adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 42 (SCA42*616795), gain-of-function mutations in this gene have recently been identified by whole exome sequencing (WES) in four children with cerebellar atrophy and ataxia, psychomotor delay, and other variable features.


METHODS
We describe four children from unrelated families with cerebellar anomalies on magnetic resonance imaging (atrophy or hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis), hypertonia, psychomotor and speech delay, severe intellectual disability, ophthalmologic features and peculiar dysmorphic traits. All patients underwent a trio-based WES analysis. Clinical records were used to characterize the clinical profile of this newly recognized disorder.


RESULTS
Two previously reported de novo disease-causing mutations in CACNA1G (c.2881G>A, p.Ala961Thr and c.4591A>G, p.Met1531Val) were identified in these patients, providing further evidence of the specific impact of these variants. All four patients exhibit distinctive dysmorphic and ectodermal features which overlap those of the previously reported patients, allowing us to define the major features characterizing this homogeneous neurodevelopmental syndromic disorder associated with upregulated CACNA1G function.

996,Debopam Samanta,"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a severe neurological disorder with infantile-onset recurrent episodes of hemiplegia on either side of the body and other paroxysmal events such as seizures, dystonia, tonic episodes, abnormal eye movements or autonomic dysfunction, primarily due to de novo pathogenic mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. The burden of neuromorbidities is significant and includes epilepsy; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; behavioral difficulties; motor, cognitive, adaptive, and learning impairment; ataxia; movement disorders; and migraine. Comprehensive multispecialty clinic with the availability of various specialists with considerable experience in alternating hemiplegia of childhood is beneficial. A comprehensive treatment plan including strict maintenance of a diary about different paroxysmal events is helpful. Disease-modifying therapy of alternating hemiplegia of childhood does not exist, and several agents such as benzodiazepines, flunarizine, topiramate, ketogenic diet, triheptanoin, steroid, amantadine, memantine, aripiprazole, oral ATP, coenzyme Q, acetazolamide, dextromethorphan, and vagus nerve stimulator have been tried with various rates of success by aborting attacks or reducing the frequency or severity of paroxysmal spells. The apparent efficacy of flunarizine is based on its use in hundreds of patients, albeit in open-label experience, but most of the other agents' reports of efficacy were from single case reports or case series of only a handful of patients. Besides reviewing existing data about individual agent active against paroxysmal events, we also review the management principles for coexisting neurological issues. However, with rapid advancement in the understanding of molecular pathogenesis and network abnormality of this disease, the treatment paradigm of alternating hemiplegia of childhood may significantly alter over the next decade.",

999,Oscar H Del Brutto,"Pineal gland calcification (PGC) has been associated with low melatonin production, a hormone with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuro-protective effects. Therefore, melatonin deficiency may play a role in the development of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), a condition that is partly related to upregulation of oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms leading to endothelial dysfunction, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and impaired interstitial fluid drainage. In this study, the association between PGC (a surrogate for melatonin deficiency) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) of presumed vascular origin (a biomarker of cSVD) was assessed in Atahualpa cohort individuals aged ≥60 years undergoing head CT and brain MRI. PGC was rated as none-to-mild and moderate-to-severe. WMHs were classified according to the modified Fazekas scale. A logistic regression model was fitted to assess the independent association between moderate-to-severe PGC and WMHs. Inverse probability of exposure weighting was used to estimate the effect of PGC on WMH. Of 373 individuals, 96 (26%) had moderate-to-severe PGC and 86 (23%) had moderate-to-severe WMHs. Moderate-to-severe PGC and WMH were independently associated in a fully-adjusted logistic regression model (OR: 2.21; 95% C.I.: 1.19-4.11; p = 0.012). Inverse probability of exposure weighting showed an estimate for the proportion of moderate-to-severe WMH among those with none-to-mild PGC of 20.5%, and the exposure-effect was 13.2% higher among those with moderate-to-severe PGC (β: 0.132; 95% C.I: 0.036-0.229; p = 0.007).

Since acute fluid-attenuated inversion recovery vascular hyperintensity (FVH) is indicative of disordered blood flow, FVH is considered a marker of acute major arterial occlusion. Conversely, the role of the absence of FVH (negative-FVH) remains unknown.


METHODS
Consecutive stroke patients were studied via magnetic resonance angiography, within 24 h of onset and major arterial occlusion. All patients were examined using serial angiography to evaluate the presence of recanalization. Patients were classified into negative-FVH and positive-FVH groups.


RESULTS
A total of 72 patients (49 [68%] male patients, aged 76 [66-83] years) were enrolled. Ten patients were allocated to the negative-FVH group and 62 to the positive-FVH group. Initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 4 (2-8) in the negative-FVH group and 10 (4-21) in the positive-FVH group (p = 0.012). Recanalization was achieved in 1 (10%) of the 10 patients in the negative-FVH group and in 49 (79%) of the 62 patients in the positive-FVH group during hospitalization (p < 0.001). Patients with recanalization were older (p = 0.023), had higher NIHSS score (p = 0.008), were admitted earlier (p = 0.014), exhibited a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.010) and anterior circulation occlusion (p = 0.021), and were more frequently treated with hyperacute recanalization therapy (p = 0.004). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that negative-FVH (odds ratio 0.087, 95% confidential interval [0.008-0.988], p = 0.049) was a negative independent factor associated with recanalization during hospitalization.

1001,Andy C H Lee,"Although a large body of research has implicated the hippocampus in the processing of memory for temporal duration, there is an exigent degree of inconsistency across studies that obfuscates the precise contributions of this structure. To shed light on this issue, the present review article surveys both historical and recent cross-species evidence emanating from a wide variety of experimental paradigms, identifying areas of convergence and divergence. We suggest that while factors such as time-scale (e.g. the length of durations involved) and the nature of memory processing (e.g. prospective vs. retrospective memory) are very helpful in the interpretation of existing data, an additional important consideration is the context in which the duration information is experienced and processed, with the hippocampus being preferentially involved in memory for durations that are embedded within a sequence of events. We consider the mechanisms that may underpin temporal duration memory and how the same mechanisms may contribute to memory for other aspects of event sequences such as temporal order.",Sathesan Thavabalasingam;Denada Alushaj;Bilgehan Cavdaroglu;Rutsuko Ito
1002,Adrien E Schramm,"We developed a new rodent model of reversible brain anoxia and performed continuous electrocorticographic (ECoG) and intracellular recordings of neocortical neurons to identify in real-time the cellular and network dynamics that successively emerge throughout the dying-to-recovery process. Along with a global decrease in ECoG amplitude, deprivation of oxygen supply resulted in an early surge of beta-gamma activities, accompanied by rhythmic membrane depolarizations and regular firing in pyramidal neurons. ECoG and intracellular signals were then dominated by low-frequency activities which progressively declined towards isoelectric levels. Cortical neurons during the isoelectric state underwent a massive membrane potential depolarizing shift, captured in the ECoG as a large amplitude triphasic wave known as the ""wave-of-death"" (WoD). This neuronal anoxic depolarization, associated with a block of action potentials and a loss of cell integrative properties, could however be reversed if brain re-oxygenation was rapidly restored (within 23.5 min). The subsequent slow repolarization of neocortical neurons resulted in a second identifiable ECoG wave we termed ""wave-of-resuscitation"" since it inaugurated the progressive regaining of pre-anoxic synaptic and firing activities. These results demonstrate that the WoD is not a biomarker of an irremediable death and unveil the cellular correlates of a novel ECoG wave that may be predictive of a successful recovery. The identification of real-time biomarkers of onset and termination of cell anoxic insult could benefit research on interventional strategies to optimize resuscitation procedures.",Antoine Carton-Leclercq;Shana Diallo;Vincent Navarro;Mario Chavez;Séverine Mahon;Stéphane Charpier

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows exploration of the mode of action of neuroactive substances in the human brain, and allows evaluation of neuronal networks, which might be involved in the action of nicotine. The aim of the present study was to explore motor cortex excitability in chronic smokers and non-smokers using TMS.


METHODS
The study included 50 healthy subjects, of whom 25 were chronic smokers and 25 were age- and sex-matched non-smokers. Number of cigarettes per day and duration of smoking in years were documented. Serum level of cotinine was measured. Resting and active motor threshold (RMT, AMT) and input-output curves (I/O) were performed to assess corticospinal excitability. The duration of the contralateral silent period (cSP) at different ranges of stimulation intensities and ipsilateral silent period (iSP) were used as measures of inhibition.


RESULTS
There were no significant differences either in RMT or AMT between groups. I/O curve showed a significant intensity×group interaction (P=0.008). This was attributable to significantly higher amplitudes of MEP among smokers than non-smokers especially at 130, 140 and 150% of RMT (P=0.0001 and P=0.03 and 0.02 respectively). The mean duration of the cSP at different intensities and iSP duration were similar in both groups. Nicotine level and smoking index were correlated respectively with rMT and iSP (P=0.03 and 0.01).


CONCLUSION
The present results confirm previous findings by Grundey et al. (2013) that chronic nicotine consumption is characterized by hyperexcitability of corticospinal output. We speculate that it is a secondary adaptation to long-term nicotine use with high inter-individual variance.",Abeer A Tony;Ahmed Abdelwarith;Mohamed Safwat

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from intracranial aneurysm rupture is an unpredictable event responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Despite inconsistencies, some studies suggest a potential role of climate conditions in SAH onset. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of climatic and lunar factors on onset of SAH in an oceanic climate such as that of Brittany, France.


METHODS
All adults with SAH admitted to the neurosurgery department and intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Rennes (France) between January 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2012 were included. Meteorological variables, their variations, lunar phases and tidal coefficients were compared between days with and without SAH.


RESULTS
We retrospectively included 295 patients with SAH. Mean minimum temperature was significantly lower during days with SAH (7.7±4.7°C versus 8.3±4.6°C; p = 0.039); temperature variation between 2 successive days was significantly greater for days with SAH (8.6±4.1°C versus 7.9±3.8°C; p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that a 2-day temperature drop greater than or equal to 8°C was associated with 35% increased risk of SAH (odds ratio 1.35 [1.03 - 1.77]). There were no significant effects of other meteorological variables, lunar phase or tidal coefficient on SAH occurrence.

Pyogenic spondylodiscitis is a rare disease, but incidence is increasing. Reported failure rates following conservative management range from 12% to 18%. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of posterior percutaneous pedicle screw fixation combined with anterior debridement and fusion (ADF) for infective spondylodiscitis in the thoracic and/or lumbar spine.


METHODS
The retrospective study cohort comprised all patients without neurological deficit who underwent minimally invasive posterior and anterior surgery between April 2008 and April 2016 for thoracic and/or lumbar spondylodiscitis.


RESULTS
Forty patients were eligible (16 female: 40%). The lumbar region was affected in 31 cases (77.5%). Source of infection was identified in only 22 cases (55%) and bacteriological identification was obtained in 32 cases (80%). Mean hospital stay was 14.8 days (range, 6-39 days). Complete recovery was achieved in 39 patients (97.5%) at 3 months' follow-up. Mean preoperative local kyphosis angle was 16.1o, versus 14o at 1-year (p>0.05). 36 patients (90%) had at least 1 year's follow-up, and fusion was obtained for all these cases.


CONCLUSION
Two-stage minimally invasive surgery is effective and safe for the treatment of single or two-level thoracolumbar spondylodiscitis. It could be an alternative to conventional open surgery or conservative treatment.",Hadrien Peyriere;Thomas Graillon;Solene Prost;Henry Dufour;Benjamin Blondel;Stephane Fuentes

Social dysfunction is a common symptom of several neuropsychiatric disorders. However, only in the last few years research began to systematically investigate clinical aspects of this relevant outcome. Interestingly, its distribution and link with other clinical variables is still unclear. This study investigated social dysfunction in 4 different cohorts of patients affected by mood disorders and schizophrenia to evaluate 1) the degree of social dysfunction in these populations; 2) the associations among social dysfunction and socio-demographic and psychopathological features.


METHODS
Data from 4 independent studies (CATIE, GSRD ES1, ES2 and ES3, STAR*D, STEP-BD) were investigated. Behavioural and affective indicators of social dysfunction were derived and operationalized from scales or questionnaire items related to the interaction with relatives, friends and significant people in patients affected by schizophrenia (N = 765) and mood disorders (N = 2278 + 1954 + 1829). In particular the social dysfunction indicator was derived from Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) for GSRD sample, from the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) for STAR*D sample, from the Life-Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LRIFT) for STEP-BD sample, and from the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) for CATIE sample. The distribution of social dysfunction was described and association with socio-demographic and psychopathological characteristics were analysed.


RESULTS
Social dysfunction indicators showed a broad distribution in all samples investigated. Consistently across studies, social dysfunction was associated with higher psychopathological severity (all samples except CATIE) and suicide risk (GSRD ES1 and ES2, STAR*D, and STEP-BD) that explain up to 47% of the variance, but also to lower education level (GSRD ES2, STAR*D, CATIE, and STEP-BD), poorer professional/work status (GSRD ES2 and ES3, STAR*D, CATIE, and STEP-BD), marital status (STAR*D and CATIE), age (younger age in GSRD ES1 and STAR*D, older age in CATIE), higher BMI (GSRD ES2 and ES3, and STEP-BD), and smoking (GSRD ES2 and ES3).


CONCLUSION
Our results demonstrated that a significant percentage of patients affected by both mood disorders and schizophrenia shows relevant social dysfunction. Social dysfunction is related, but not completely explained by psychopathological severity. In several patients, it tends to persist also during remission state. Socio-demographic and lifestyle factors were also found to play a role and should therefore be taken into consideration in further studies investigating social dysfunction.",Siegfried Kasper;Joseph Zohar;Daniel Souery;Stuart Montgomery;Panagiotis Ferentinos;Dan Rujescu;Julien Mendlewicz;Emilio Merlo Pich;Stephane Pollentier;Brenda W J H Penninx;Alessandro Serretti
1007,Woosuk Kim,"In a previous study, we observed the effect of phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) on proliferating cells and neuroblasts in the subgranular zone of mouse dentate gyrus. In the present study, we examined the roles of PGAM1 in the HT22 hippocampal cell line and in gerbil hippocampus after H2O2-induced oxidative stress and after ischemia/reperfusion, respectively. Control-PGAM1 and Tat-PGAM1 proteins were synthesized using Tat-1 expression vector since Tat-1 fusion proteins can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and cell membranes. We found that transduction of Tat-PGAM1 protein into HT22 cells was dose- and time-dependent. Delivery of the protein to the cytoplasm was confirmed by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Treatment of HT22 cells with Tat-PGAM1 protein showed a concentration-dependent reduction in cell damage and decreased formation of reactive oxygen species after H2O2 exposure. Tat-PGAM1 administration significantly ameliorated the ischemia-induced hyperactivity in gerbils at 1 day after ischemia/reperfusion. Additionally, a pronounced decrease in neuronal damage and reactive gliosis were observed in the hippocampal CA1 region of the Tat-PGAM1-treated group at 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion compared to that in the vehicle (Tat peptide) or control-PGAM1-treated groups. Administration of Tat-PGAM1 mitigated the changes in ATP content, succinate dehydrogenase activity, pH, and 4-hydroxynonenal levels in the hippocampus at 4 and 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion compared to that in the vehicle-treated group. In addition, administration of Tat-PGAM1 significantly ameliorated the ischemia-induced increases of lactate levels in the hippocampus at 15 min and 6 h after ischemia/reperfusion than in the vehicle or control-PGAM1-treated groups. These results suggest that Tat-PGAM1 can be used as a therapeutic agent to prevent neuronal damage from oxidative stress or ischemia.",Hyun Jung Kwon;Hyo Young Jung;Dae Young Yoo;Dae Won Kim;In Koo Hwang
1008,Ganiyu Oboh,"Many plant foods are rich sources of rutin, a flavonoid with many biological activities and health benefits. Exposure to cadmium has been implicated in neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction in animal models. However, there is a dearth of information on the effect of rutin on the cadmium bioavailability in the brain of rats exposed to cadmium. Thus, the present study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of rutin in an animal model of cognitive impairment via alterations of cadmium bioavailability in cadmium-exposed rats. Animals were divided into six groups (n = 6): group 1 served as control, groups 2 and 3 are normal rats received 25 and 50 mg/kg of rutin respectively, group 4 received cadmium (5 mg/kg), while groups 5 and 6 are cadmium-exposed rats treated with 25 and 50 mg/kg rutin respectively via oral administration for 21 days. Rutin was administered 30 min after cadmium administration each day. The spatial working memory of the exposed and treated rats was assessed using Morris water maze and Y-Maze tasks. Furthermore, the residual level of cadmium ion in the brain of the rats was estimated. The cholinesterase (AChE and BChE) activities and nitric oxide level were determined. Besides, the level of oxidative stress markers (ROS and MDA) was assessed. Results revealed that rutin significantly reduced cadmium bioavailability in the brain of cadmium-exposed rats. Moreso, cadmium increased cholinesterase (AChE and BChE) activities and level of oxidative stress markers in the brain, with a concomitant decrease in nitric oxide level. However, treatment with rutin decreased cholinesterase activities and the level of oxidative stress markers in cadmium-exposed rats. Also, rutin improved spatial working memory and learning processes as revealed by Morris water maze and Y-Maze tasks. Conclusively, rutin could be considered to possess cognitive-enhancing properties possibly through alterations of cadmium bioavailability in the brain of cadmium-exposed rats.",Adeniyi A Adebayo;Ayokunle O Ademosun;Olanike G Olowokere
1009,Jeong Su Byun,"Astrocytes are abundant cells in the brain and have vital roles in various brain functions that include biochemical support of endothelial cells, supplying nutrients to the nervous tissue, maintaining the extracellular ion balance, etc. In developing nervous tissue, the differentiation of astrocytes occurs later compared to neurons. It takes more time and more techniques to obtain mature and pure astrocytes in vitro. In this study, a protocol was developed to culture mature and pure astrocytes from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). To obtain a high quantity and quality of differentiated astrocytes, first, we efficiently generated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from hESCs through the process of embryoid body (EB) formation by adding SB431542 and LDN193189 and neurosphere step. In the astrocyte differentiation stage, the efficiency of astrocyte differentiation was increased using progenitor medium containing EGF and heparin and astrocyte defined medium containing ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The cell properties were checked with immunocytochemistry and western blot using antibodies for astrocyte-specific marker proteins. From the FACS analysis, we found that the percentage of astrocytes among the cells differentiated from NPCs was over 80%. To validate the functional properties of the astrocytes, we checked IL-6 release from the astrocytes and support of synaptic formation in a co-culture with neurons. Taken altogether, with our protocol, we obtained mature astrocytes within 4 weeks from NPCs and 6 weeks from hESCs.",Cheon Ok Lee;Mihee Oh;Dongwook Cha;Won-Kon Kim;Kyung-Jin Oh;Kwang-Hee Bae;Sang-Chun Lee;Baek-Soo Han
1010,Kuan Liu,"Thalamocortical axons (TCAs) transmit sensory information to the neocortex by responding to a variety of guidance cues in the environment. Similar to classical guidance cues (ephrins, slits, semaphorins and netrins), morphogens of FGFs can also help axons navigate to their targets. Here, expression analyses reveal that FGF10 is expressed in the chick prethalamus during the navigation of TCAs. Then, using ex vivo analyses in chick explants, we demonstrate a dose-dependent effect of FGF10 on thalamic axons: low concentration of FGF10 attracts thalamic axons, while high concentration FGF10 repels thalamic axons. Moreover, inhibition of FGF10 function indicates that FGF10 exerts a direct effect on thalamic axons. Together, these studies reveal a direct role for the member of FGF7 subfamily, FGF10, in the axonal navigation of TCAs.",Zhongsheng Lv;Hong Huang;Mingyue Li;Li Xiao;Xiang Li;Gang Li;Fang Liu
1011,Kelly Webster,"Once thought to simply reflect passive cortical idling, recent studies have demonstrated that alpha oscillations play a causal role in cognition and perception. However, whether and how cognitive or sensory processes modulate various components of the alpha rhythm is poorly understood. Sensory input and resting states were manipulated in human subjects while electroencephalography (EEG) activity was recorded in three conditions: eyes-open fixating on a visual stimulus, eyes-open without visual input (darkness), and eyes-closed without visual input (darkness). We show that alpha power and peak frequency increase when visual input is reduced compared to the eyes open, fixating conditions. These results suggest that increases in alpha power reflect a shift from an exteroceptive to interoceptive state and that increases in peak frequency following restricted visual input (darkness) may reflect increased sampling of the external environment in order to detect stimuli. They further demonstrate how sensory information modulates alpha and the importance of selecting an appropriate resting condition in studies of alpha.Significance Statement Alpha oscillations have long been considered to reflect a stable neural trait, but we demonstrate that alpha is a state that varies with sensory input. By manipulating both eye state and sensory input, we demonstrate that under resting state conditions, visual input drives changes in alpha power and peak frequency. These changes likely allow the visual system to dynamically switch between interoceptive and exteroceptive states to prioritize detection of weak and/or infrequent visual stimuli. This work has important implications for studies of resting state brain dynamics, which have traditionally employed a variety of resting state conditions that may or may not match task conditions in terms of sensory input.",Tony Ro
1012,Ting-Yu Chang,"Reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) scenes from two-dimensional (2D) retinal images is an ill-posed problem. Despite this, 3D perception of the world based on 2D retinal images is seemingly accurate and precise. The integration of distinct visual cues is essential for robust 3D perception in humans, but it is unclear if this is true for non-human primates. Here we assessed 3D perception in macaque monkeys using a planar surface orientation discrimination task. Perception was accurate across a wide range of spatial poses (orientations and distances), but precision was highly dependent on the plane's pose. The monkeys achieved robust 3D perception by dynamically reweighting the integration of stereoscopic and perspective cues according to their pose-dependent reliabilities. Errors in performance could be explained by a prior resembling the 3D orientation statistics of natural scenes. We used neural network simulations based on 3D orientation selective neurons recorded from the same monkeys to assess how neural computation might constrain perception. The perceptual data were consistent with a model in which two independent neuronal populations representing stereoscopic cues and perspective cues (with perspective signals from the two eyes combined using nonlinear canonical computations) were optimally integrated through linear summation. Perception of combined-cue stimuli was optimal given this architecture. However, an alternative architecture in which stereoscopic cues, left eye perspective cues, and right eye perspective cues were represented by three independent populations yielded two times greater precision than the monkeys. This result suggests that, due to canonical computations, cue integration for 3D perception is optimized but not maximized.Significance Statement Our eyes sense 2D projections of the world, like a movie on a screen, but we perceive the world in 3D. Here we show that non-human primates, like humans, achieve more precise 3D vision by perceptually integrating distinct 3D cues. We also present evidence that perception is influenced by 3D natural scene statistics, and that priors over 3D orientation are subjectively encoded. Using simulations, we examine how neural computation can constrain 3D perception and estimate that perception is half as precise as theoretically possible. Our findings suggest that the concurrence of multiple canonical computations simultaneously optimizes and curbs 3D visual perception, and highlight that what constitutes optimal task performance depends on the underlying neural architecture.",Lowell Thompson;Raymond Doudlah;Byounghoon Kim;Adhira Sunkara;Ari Rosenberg
1013,Álvaro Cobo-Calvo,"OBJECTIVE
To address the frequency of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody (Ab) in an unselected large cohort of adults with MS.


METHODS
This is a cross-sectional study in 2 MS expert centers (Lyon and Strasbourg University Hospitals, France) between December 1, 2017, and June 31, 2018. Patients aged ≥18 years with a definite diagnosis of MS according to 2010 McDonald criteria were tested for MOG-Ab by using a cell-based assay (CBA) in Lyon and subsequently included. Positive samples were tested by investigators blinded to the first result with a second assay in a different laboratory (Barcelona, Spain) by using the same plasmid and secondary Ab.


RESULTS
Serum samples from 685 consecutive patients with MS were analyzed for MOG-Ab. Median disease duration at sampling was 11.5 (interquartile range, 5.8-17.7) years, and 72% were women. Two (0.3%) patients resulted to be MOG-Ab-positive. The 2 patients were women aged 42 and 38 at disease onset and were diagnosed with secondary and primary progressive forms of MS, respectively. This positive result was confirmed by the CBA in Barcelona.


CONCLUSION
Our findings indicate that MOG-Ab are exceptional in MS phenotype, suggesting that the MOG-Ab testing should not be performed in typical MS presentation.",Hyacintha d'Indy;Anne Ruiz;Nicolas Collongues;Laurent Kremer;Françoise Durand-Dubief;Fabien Rollot;Romain Casey;Sandra Vukusic;Jérôme De Seze;Romain Marignier

Here we detail how ZIKV infection produces extensive neuropathology in the developing mouse brain and spinal cord of both sexes. Surprisingly, neuropathology differs depending on viral strain with a French Polynesian isolate producing primarily excitotoxicity and a Brazilian isolate being almost exclusively apoptotic but occurring over a prolonged period that is more likely to produce severe hypoplasia. We also show exposure can produce a characteristic pattern of infection that mirrors neuropathology and ultimately results in gross morphological deformities strikingly similar to CZS. This research provides a valuable mouse model mirroring the clinical course of disease that can be used to test potential therapies to improve treatment and gain a better understanding of the disabilities associated with CZS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTZika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy has been causally linked to a constellation of neurodevelopmental deformities in the fetus resulting in a disease termed Congenital Zika Syndrome.

1015,Kineret Inbar,"Cocaine-driven changes in the modulation of neurotransmission by neuromodulators are poorly understood. The ventral pallidum (VP) is a key structure in the reward system, in which GABA neurotransmission is regulated by opioid neuropeptides, including dynorphin. However, it is not known whether dynorphin acts differently on different cell types in the VP and whether its effects are altered by withdrawal from cocaine. Here, we trained wild-type, D1-Cre, A2A-Cre or vGluT2-Cre:Ai9 male and female mice in a cocaine conditioned place preference protocol followed by two weeks of abstinence, and then recorded GABAergic synaptic input evoked either electrically or optogenetically onto identified VP neurons before and after applying dynorphin. We found that after cocaine CPP and abstinence dynorphin attenuated inhibitory input to VPGABA neurons through a postsynaptic mechanism. This effect was absent in saline mice. Furthermore, this effect was seen specifically on the inputs from nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons expressing either the D1 or the D2 dopamine receptor. Unlike its effect on VPGABA neurons, dynorphin surprisingly potentiated the inhibitory input on VPvGluT2 neurons, but this effect was abolished after cocaine CPP and abstinence. Thus, dynorphin has contrasting influences on GABA input to VPGABA and VPvGluT2 neurons and these influences are affected differentially by cocaine CPP and abstinence. Collectively, our data suggest a role for dynorphin in withdrawal through its actions in the VP. As VPGABA and VPvGluT2 neurons have contrasting effects on drug-seeking behavior, our data may indicate a complex role for dynorphin in withdrawal from cocaine.Significance statementThe ventral pallidum consists mainly of GABAergic reward-promoting neurons, but it also encloses a subgroup of aversion-promoting glutamatergic neurons. Dynorphin, an opioid neuropeptide abundant in the ventral pallidum, shows differential modulation of GABA input to GABAergic and glutamatergic pallidal neurons and may therefore affect both the rewarding and aversive aspects of withdrawal. Indeed, abstinence after repeated exposure to cocaine alters dynorphin actions in a cell-type-specific manner - after abstinence dynorphin suppresses the inhibitory drive on the ""rewarding"" GABAergic neurons but ceases to modulate the inhibitory drive on the ""aversive"" glutamatergic neurons. This reflects a complex role for dynorphin in cocaine reward and abstinence.",Liran A Levi;Nimrod Bernat;Tal Odesser;Dorrit Inbar;Yonatan M Kupchik
1016,Jason A Avery,"In the mammalian brain, the insula is the primary cortical substrate involved in the perception of taste. Recent imaging studies in rodents have identified a 'gustotopic' organization in the insula, whereby distinct insula regions are selectively responsive to one of the five basic tastes. However, numerous studies in monkeys have reported that gustatory cortical neurons are broadly-tuned to multiple tastes, and tastes are not represented in discrete spatial locations. Neuroimaging studies in humans have thus far been unable to discern between these two models, though this may be due to the relatively low spatial resolution employed in taste studies to date. In the present study, we examined the spatial representation of taste within the human brain using ultra-high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high magnetic field strength (7-Tesla). During scanning, male and female participants tasted sweet, salty, sour and tasteless liquids, delivered via a custom-built MRI-compatible tastant-delivery system. Our univariate analyses revealed that all tastes (vs. tasteless) activated primary taste cortex within the bilateral dorsal mid-insula, but no brain region exhibited a consistent preference for any individual taste. However, our multivariate searchlight analyses were able to reliably decode the identity of distinct tastes within those mid-insula regions, as well as brain regions involved in affect and reward, such as the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala. These results suggest that taste quality is not represented topographically, but by a distributed population code, both within primary taste cortex as well as regions involved in processing the hedonic and aversive properties of taste.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe insula is the primary cortical substrate involved in taste perception, yet some question remains as to whether this region represents distinct tastes topographically or via a population code.

1017,Liran A Levi,"The ventral pallidum (VP) is a central node in the reward system strongly implicated in reward and addiction. While the majority of VP neurons is GABAergic and encodes reward, recent studies revealed a novel glutamatergic neuronal population in the VP (VPvGluT2), whose activation generates aversion. Withdrawal from drugs has been shown to induce drastic synaptic changes in neuronal populations associated with reward, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or nucleus accumbens neurons, but less is known about cocaine-induced synaptic changes in neurons classically linked with aversion. Here we demonstrate that VPvGluT2 neurons contact different targets with different intensities and that cocaine conditioned-place preference (CPP) training followed by abstinence selectively potentiates their synapses on targets that encode aversion. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings combined with optogenetics in male and female transgenic mice we show that VPvGluT2 neurons preferentially contact aversion-related neurons, such as lateral habenula neurons and VTA GABAergic neurons, with minor input to reward-related neurons like VTA dopamine and VP GABA neurons. Moreover, after cocaine CPP and abstinence the VPvGluT2 input to the aversion-related structures is potentiated while the input to the reward-related structures is depressed. Thus, cocaine CPP followed by abstinence may allow VPvGluT2 neurons to recruit aversion-related targets more readily and therefore be part of the mechanism underlying the aversive symptoms seen after withdrawal.Significance statementThe biggest problem in drug addiction is the high propensity to relapse. One central driver for relapse events is the negative aversive symptoms experienced by addicts during withdrawal. In this work we propose a possible mechanism for the intensification of aversive feelings after withdrawal that involves the glutamatergic neurons of the ventral pallidum. We show that not only these neurons are most strongly connected to aversive targets such as the lateral habenula, but that after abstinence their synapses on aversive targets are strengthened while the synapses on other, rewarding, targets are weakened. These data illustrate how after abstinence from cocaine aversive pathways change in a manner that may contribute to relapse.",Kineret Inbar;Noa Nachshon;Nimrod Bernat;Ava Gatterer;Dorrit Inbar;Yonatan M Kupchik

1019,Barbara Albuquerque Morais,"PURPOSE
Brainstem lesions comprise 10-20% of all pediatric brain tumors. Over the past years, the benefits of stereotactic biopsy versus the use alone of MRI features to guide treatment have been controversial.


METHODS
Retrospective study with pediatric patients submitted to stereotactic brainstem biopsies between 2008 and 2018. Demographic, clinical, imaging, and surgical characteristics were recorded, as well as the histological diagnosis, complications, and survival. Predictors of survival were evaluated through Cox regression models after multivariate adjustment.


RESULTS
Twenty-six patients (mean age of 8.8 ± 4.3 years and 14 female). Diagnosis was reached on 84.6% (95% CI 65.1-95.6%) of the patients. Glioma was diagnosed on 20 cases (11 high-grade and 9 low-grade lesions). There was no association between age and gender and the dichotomized histological diagnosis. Contrast enhancement, diffuse distribution, invasion of adjacent structures, and remote injury were present on 62.5%, 75.0%, 62.5%, and 25.0% of the cases. Hydrocephalus at admission was present on almost half of the patients (46.2%). Only radiological invasion of adjacent structures had a possible association with high-grade lesions (p = 0.057). Surgical trajectory was trans-cerebellar in most of the cases (79.9%). There were no major complications and only two minor/transitory complications. Poorer survival was independently associated with high-grade lesions (HR 32.14, 95% CI 1.40-735.98, p = 0.030) and contrast enhancement at MRI (HR 36.54, 95% CI 1.40-952.26, p = 0.031).


CONCLUSIONS
Stereotactic biopsy was safe and allows successful tissue sampling for a definite diagnosis. Poorer survival was independently associated with high-grade and contrast-enhancing lesions.",Davi Jorge Fontoura Solla;Hamilton Matushita;Manoel Jacobsen Teixeira;Bernardo A Monaco
1020,Mir Ibrahim Sajid,"BACKGROUND
The most common primary CNS tumor in children is the medulloblastoma, which generally occurs in the posterior fossa and can spread through the CNS and spinal cord. Although the recurrence of renal cell carcinoma as a secondary tumor to neuroblastoma has been reported with successful anti-neoplastic treatment, the rare occurrence of a child who initially had medulloblastoma and then developed translocation renal cell carcinoma has never been reported before.


CASE PRESENTATION
We report the case of a 12-year-old boy who initially presented with complaints of vomiting and headache. An MRI head confirmed the presence of 4 × 4 × 3 cm lesion which was resected completely and histopathology report confirmed the diagnosis of medulloblastoma Grade IV. Four years later, the child came for a follow-up visit and during routine screening, a CT scan showed heterogeneous lesion arising from the lower pole calyx of right kidney. The patient was referred to pediatric surgery for right radical nephrectomy involving the right adrenal gland. The histopathology report was consistent with the diagnosis of translocation renal cell carcinoma.


CONCLUSION
Central nervous system (CNS) tumors remain the leading cause of death among pediatric neoplasms. We advise genetic testing of index cases and the establishment of an international tumor registry for a challenging disease.",Ayesha Saleem;Muhammad Arshad;Zehra Fadoo;Nasir Ud Din
1021,Luca Papavero,"PURPOSE
Patients with central lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) have a longer symptom history, more severe stenosis, and worse postoperative outcomes, when redundant nerve roots (RNRs) are evident in the preoperative MRI. The objective was to test the inter- and intra-rater reliability of an MRI-based classification for RNR.


METHODS
This is a retrospective reliability study. A neuroradiologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a neurosurgeon, and three orthopedic surgeons in-training classified RNR on 126 preoperative MRIs of patients with LSS admitted for microsurgical decompression. On sagittal and axial T2-weighted images, the following four categories were classified: allocation (A) of the key stenotic level, shape (S), extension (E), and direction (D) of the RNR. A second read with cases ordered differently was performed 4 weeks later. Fleiss and Cohen's kappa procedures were used to determine reliability.


RESULTS
The allocation, shape, extension, and direction (ASED) classification showed moderate to almost perfect inter-rater reliability, with kappa values (95% CI) of 0.86 (0.83, 0.90), 0.62 (0.57, 0.66), 0.56 (0.51, 0.60), and 0.66 (0.63, 0.70) for allocation, shape, extension, and direction, respectively. Intra-rater reliability was almost perfect, with kappa values of 0.90 (0.88, 0.92), 0.86 (0.84, 0.88), and 0.84 (0.81, 0.87) for shape, extension, and direction, respectively. Intra-rater kappa values were similar for junior and senior raters. Kappa values for inter-rater reliability were similar between the first and second reads (p = 0.06) among junior raters and improved among senior raters (p = 0.008).

The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has become increasingly employed in the treatment of suprasellar meningiomas. These tumors often cause visual symptoms due to compression of the anterior visual pathway. We aimed to examine long-term visual outcomes after EEA for optic nerve decompression and resection of suprasellar meningioma at our center, and to identify preoperative factors predictive of postoperative visual improvement.


METHODS
We performed a retrospective cohort study on 27 patients who underwent the EEA for resection of meningiomas extending into the suprasellar cistern and decompression of anterior visual pathway between January 1, 2005, and March 1, 2019.


RESULTS
We treated 8 male and 19 female patients, with a mean follow-up of 7.6 years. The mean age of our patients at initial presentation was 60.1 years. Eighteen patients (66.7%) are presented with visual acuity deficits, and 12 (44.4%) patients are presented with visual field deficits. Postoperatively, 11 patients had improved visual acuity, 6 had stable visual acuity, and 1 patient had slow and progressive decline of visual acuity; 5 patients had improved visual field, 6 had stable visual field, and 1 patient had slow and progressive decline in visual field. Patients less likely to have postoperative improvement of visual acuity were those with longer than 6-month duration of visual symptoms (P = 0.024*) as well as patients with the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) (P = 0.023*).

1023,Michael Naidoo,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by frameshift mutations in the DMD gene that prevent the body-wide translation of its protein product, dystrophin. Besides a severe muscle phenotype, cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms are prevalent. Dystrophin protein 71 (Dp71) is the major DMD gene product expressed in the brain and mutations affecting its expression are associated with the DMD neuropsychiatric syndrome. As with dystrophin in muscle, Dp71 localises to dystrophin-associated protein complexes in the brain. However, unlike in skeletal muscle; in the brain, Dp71 is alternatively spliced to produce many isoforms with differential subcellular localisations and diverse cellular functions. These include neuronal differentiation, adhesion, cell division and excitatory synapse organisation as well as nuclear functions such as nuclear scaffolding and DNA repair. In this review, we first describe brain involvement in DMD and the abnormalities observed in the DMD brain. We then review the gene expression, RNA processing and functions of Dp71. We review genotype-phenotype correlations and discuss emerging cellular/tissue evidence for the involvement of Dp71 in the neuropathophysiology of DMD. The literature suggests changes observed in the DMD brain are neurodevelopmental in origin and that their risk and severity is associated with a cumulative loss of distal DMD gene products such as Dp71. The high risk of neuropsychiatric syndromes in Duchenne patients warrants early intervention to achieve the best possible quality of life. Unravelling the function and pathophysiological significance of dystrophin in the brain has become a high research priority to inform the development of brain-targeting treatments for Duchenne.",Karen Anthony
1024,Mariana Grigoruţă,"Psychological distress is a public health issue as it contributes to the development of human diseases including neuropathologies. Parkinson's disease (PD), a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by multiple factors including aging, mitochondrial dysfunction, and/or stressors. In PD, a substantial loss of substantia nigra (SN) neurons leads to rigid tremors, bradykinesia, and chronic fatigue. Several studies have reported that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is altered in PD patients, leading to an increase level of cortisol which contributes to neurodegeneration and oxidative stress. We hypothesized that chronic psychological distress induces PD-like symptoms and promotes neurodegeneration in wild-type (WT) rats and exacerbates PD pathology in PINK1 knockout (KO) rats, a well-validated animal model of PD. We measured the bioenergetics profile (oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis) in the brain by employing an XF24e Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer in young rats subjected to predator-induced psychological distress. In addition, we analyzed anxiety-like behavior, motor function, expression of antioxidant enzymes, mitochondrial content, and neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain. Overall, we observed that psychological distress diminished up to 50% of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) derived from both WT and PINK1-KO rats. Mechanistically, the level of antioxidant proteins, mitochondrial content, and BDNF was significantly altered. Finally, psychological distress robustly induced anxiety and Parkinsonian symptoms in WT rats and accelerated certain symptoms of PD in PINK1-KO rats. For the first time, our collective data suggest that psychological distress can phenocopy several aspects of PD neuropathology, disrupt brain energy production, as well as induce ataxia-like behavior.",Alejandro Martínez-Martínez;Raul Y Dagda;Ruben K Dagda
1025,Giuseppe Gervasi,"Dementias are chronic, degenerative neurological disorders with a complex management that require the cooperation of different healthcare professionals.

We searched all available Italian territorial ICPs. Two raters assessed the retrieved ICPs with a 2-point scale on a 43-item checklist based on the GICPD. Only 5 out of 21 regions and 5 out of 101 local health authorities had an ICP, with most ICPs having a moderate compliance to the GICPD, in particular for the items referring to the development and implementation of the care pathways. A low to moderate inter-rater agreement was observed, mainly due to a lack of standardized models to describe ICPs for dementias. Results suggest that policy- and decision-makers should pay more attention to the GICPD when producing ICPs. The direct communication with clinicians, and the implementation of more precise and appropriate clinical outcomes, could increase the involvement of clinicians, whose participation is crucial to guarantee that ICPs meet needs of patients and their carers.",Guido Bellomo;Flavia Mayer;Valerio Zaccaria;Ilaria Bacigalupo;Eleonora Lacorte;Marco Canevelli;Massimo Corbo;Teresa Di Fiandra;Nicola Vanacore

Evidence pointing to a synergistic effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with concurrent immunotherapy or targeted therapy in patients with melanoma brain metastases (BM) is increasing. We aimed to analyze the effect on overall survival (OS) of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) or BRAF/MEK inhibitors initiated during the 9 weeks before or after SRS. We also evaluated the prognostic value of patients' and disease characteristics as predictors of OS in patients treated with SRS.


METHODS
We identified patients with BM from cutaneous or unknown primary origin melanoma treated with SRS between 2011 and 2018.


RESULTS
We included 84 patients. The median OS was 12 months (95% CI 9-20 months). The median follow-up was 30 months (95% CI 28-49). Twenty-eight patients with newly diagnosed BM initiated anti-PD-1 +/-CTLA-4 therapy (n = 18), ipilimumab monotherapy (n = 10) or BRAF+/- MEK inhibitors (n = 11), during the 9 weeks before or after SRS. Patients who received anti-PD-1 +/-CTLA-4 mAb showed an improved survival in comparison to ipilimumab monotherapy (OS 24 vs. 7.5 months; HR 0.32, 95% 0.12-0.83, p = 0.02) and BRAF +/-MEK inhibitors (OS 24 vs. 7 months, respectively; HR 0.11, 95% 0.04-0.34, p = 0.0001). This benefit remained significant when compared to the subgroup of patients treated with dual BRAF/MEK inhibition (BMi) (n = 5). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis an age > 65, synchronous BM, > 2 metastatic sites, > 4 BM, and an ECOG > 1 were correlated with poorer prognosis. A treatment with anti-PD-1+/-CTLA-4 mAbs within 9 weeks of SRS was associated with better outcomes. The presence of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels ≥ 2xULN at BM diagnosis was associated with lower OS (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.03-2.50; p = 0.04).


CONCLUSIONS
The concurrent administration of anti-PD-1+/-CTLA-4 mAbs with SRS was associated with improved survival in melanoma patients with newly diagnosed BM. In addition to CNS tumor burden, the extension of systemic disease retains its prognostic value in patients treated with SRS.

With the emergence of the ""brain-gut-microbiome axis,"" we take the opportunity to review what is known about trace amines in the brain, the defined sources of trace amines in the gut, and emerging understandings on the levels of trace amines in various gastrointestinal disorders. Similarly, we discuss localization of TAAR1 expression in the gut, novel findings that TAAR1 may be implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases, and the reported comorbidities of neuropsychiatric disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. With the emergence of TAAR1 specific compounds as next-generation therapeutics for schizophrenia (Roche) and Parkinson's related psychoses (Sunovion), we hypothesize a therapeutic benefit of these compounds in clinical trials in the brain-gut-microbiome axis, as well as a potential for thoughtful manipulation of the brain-gut-microbiome axis to modulate symptoms of neuropsychiatric disease.",Dulce Pamela González;Neva Olliffe;Haley Oller;Rachel Hoffing;Marissa Puzan;Sahar El Aidy;Gregory M Miller
1029,Nasrin Soltani,"Since no definitive treatment has been suggested for diffuse traumatic brain injury (TBI), and also as the effect of exercise has been proven to be beneficial in neurodegenerative diseases, the effect of endurance exercise on the complications of TBI along with its possible neuroprotective mechanism was investigated in this study. Our objective was to find out whether previous endurance exercise influences brain edema and neurological outcome in TBI. We also assessed the probable mechanism of endurance exercise effect in TBI. Rats were randomly assigned into four groups of sham, TBI, exercise + sham and exercise + TBI. Endurance exercise was carried out before TBI. Brain edema was assessed by calculating the percentage of brain water content 24 h after the surgery. Neurological outcome was evaluated by obtaining veterinary coma scale (VCS) at - 1, 1, 4 and 24 h after the surgery. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl and histopathological changes were evaluated 24 h after the surgery. Previous exercise prevented the increase in brain water content, MDA level, histopathological edema and apoptosis following TBI. The reduction in VCS in exercise + TBI group was lower than that of TBI group. In addition, a decrease in the level of serum IL-1β and the content of brain protein carbonyl was reported in exercise + TBI group in comparison with the TBI group. We suggest that the previous endurance exercise prevents brain edema and improves neurological outcome following diffuse TBI, probably by reducing apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress.",Zahra Soltani;Mohammad Khaksari;Ghasem Ebrahimi;Mojdeh Hajmohammmadi;Maryam Iranpour
1030,Shareefa Alghamdi,"Major depressive disorder is a serious neuropsychiatric disease that leads to significant impairment in social functioning and increased morbidity and mortality. Low vitamin D (25-OH D) levels have been hypothesized to contribute to the pathophysiology of MDD. To investigate the therapeutic role of vitamin D in MDD, we recruited 62 male and female patients diagnosed with MDD and randomized them into two groups: the first group (49 patients) received vitamin D supplementation as cholecalciferol vitamin D3 (50,000 I.U.) for 3 months, in addition to standard of care (SOC) which included pharmacological treatment and psychological support, and the second group (13 patients) received only SOC without vitamin D supplementation for 3 months. The Beck depression inventory (BDI) scale was used to assess the severity of MDD symptoms. Immunoassays were utilized to determine levels of serum vitamin D3 and serotonin in all patients. The results showed significant gender differences; female patients showed the most improvement in their depressive symptoms after 3-month vitamin D supplementation. Females with moderate, severe, and extreme depression had significantly lower BDI scores after vitamin D treatment (p < 0.05). Among males, only those diagnosed with severe depression showed significant improvement in their BDI scores (p < 0.05). Serum serotonin levels were significantly increased after vitamin D supplementation compared to baseline in both male and female patients. No significant changes in other biochemical parameters were detected between the two groups. These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation may ameliorate symptoms of MDD, particularly in females, via a serotonin-dependent mechanism.",Nabilah Alsulami;Sawsan Khoja;Hadeil Alsufiani;Haythum O Tayeb;Frank I Tarazi

To assess the reliability and predictive validity of the developmental and socio-emotional scales of the Standardized Infant NeuroDevelopmental Assessment (SINDA).


METHOD
To assess reliability, two sets of three assessors forming eight assessor-pairs independently rated the developmental and socio-emotional scales of 60 infants. To evaluate predictive validity, 223 infants (gestational age 30wks [range 23-41wks]; 117 males, 106 females) attending a non-academic outpatient clinic were assessed by different assessors with SINDA's neurological, developmental, and socio-emotional scales. Atypical neurodevelopmental outcome at a corrected age of 24 months or older implied a Bayley Mental or Psychomotor Developmental Index score of less than 70 or neurological disorder (including cerebral palsy). Behavioural and emotional disorders were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Predictive values were calculated from SINDA (2-12mo corrected age, median 7mo) and typical versus atypical outcome, and for intellectual disability only (Mental Developmental Index <70).


RESULTS
Assessors highly agreed on the developmental and socio-emotional assessments (developmental scores: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ρ=0.972; single socio-emotional behaviour items: Cohen's κ=0.783-0.896). At 24 months or older, 65 children had atypical outcome. Atypical neurological scores predicted atypical outcome (sensitivity 83%, specificity 96%); atypical developmental scores predicted intellectual disability (sensitivity 77%, specificity 92%). Atypical emotionality and atypical self-regulation were associated with behavioural and emotional disorders.


INTERPRETATION
SINDA's three scales are reliable, and have a satisfactory predictive validity for atypical developmental outcome at 24 months or older in a non-academic outpatient setting. SINDA's developmental scale has promising predictive validity for intellectual disability. SINDA's socio-emotional scale is a tool for caregiver counselling.


WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
Standardized Infant NeuroDevelopmental Assessment (SINDA)'s developmental and socio-emotional scales have excellent interrater reliability. Replication of the satisfactory validity of SINDA's neurological scale for atypical outcome.",Uta Tacke;Joachim Pietz;André Rupp;Heike Philippi

To critically analyse the management of status dystonicus and prestatus dystonicus in children and adolescents, in order to examine clinical features, acute management, and risk of relapse in a paediatric cohort.


METHOD
Clinical, demographic, and therapeutic features were analysed according to disease severity. Risk of subsequent relapse was estimated through Kaplan-Meier curves.


RESULTS
Thirty-four patients (eight females, 26 males) experiencing 63 episodes of acute dystonia exacerbations at a tertiary referral Italian hospital were identified. Mean age at status dystonicus presentation was 9 years 11 months (11y at inclusion in the study). Onset of dystonia dated back to infancy in most cases. Fourteen patients experienced two or more episodes. Infections were the most common trigger (48%). Benzodiazepines were the most commonly used drugs for acute management. Stereotactic pallidotomy was performed in six cases during status dystonicus, and in two additional patients it was electively performed after medical management. The probability of survival free from status dystonicus relapses was 78% after 4 months and 61% after 27 months.


INTERPRETATION
Dystonia exacerbations are potentially life-threating emergencies, with a considerable risk of relapse. Nevertheless, no obvious factors for relapse risk stratification exist. Pallidotomy is a feasible option in medical refractory status dystonicus for patients with limited deep brain stimulation applicability, but the risk of recurrence is elevated.",Federica Graziola;Francesco Nicita;Flaminia Frascarelli;Franco Randi;Marco Zazza;Laura Cantonetti;Silvia Cossu;Carlo Efisio Marras;Alessandro Capuano
1033,Alice Mado Proverbio,"The neural mechanisms involved in the processing of vocalizations and music were compared, in order to observe possible similarities in the encoding of their emotional content. Positive and negative emotional vocalizations (e.g., laughing, crying) and violin musical stimuli digitally extracted from them were used as stimuli. They shared the melodic profile and main pitch/frequency characteristics. Participants listened to vocalizations or music while detecting rare auditory targets (bird tweeting, or piano's arpeggios). EEG was recorded from 128 sites. P2, N400 and Late positivity responses of ERPs were analyzed. P2 peak was earlier in response to vocalizations, while P2 amplitude was larger to positive than negative stimuli. N400 was greater to negative than positive stimuli. LP was greater to vocalizations than music and to positive than negative stimuli. Source modeling using swLORETA suggested that, among N400 generators, the left middle temporal gyrus and the right uncus responded to both music and vocalizations, and more to negative than positive stimuli. The right parahippocampal region of the limbic lobe and the right cingulate cortex were active during music listening, while the left superior temporal cortex only responded to human vocalizations. Negative stimuli always activated the right middle temporal gyrus, whereas positively-valenced stimuli always activated the inferior frontal cortex. The processing of emotional vocalizations and music seemed to involve common neural mechanisms. Notation obtained from acoustic signals showed how emotionally negative stimuli tended to be in Minor key, and positive stimuli in Major key, thus shedding some lights on the brain ability to understand music.",Francesco de Benedetto;Martina Guazzone
1034,Jordi Bruna,"Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common, dose limiting, and long-lasting disabling adverse events of chemotherapy treatment. Unfortunately, no treatment has proven efficacy to prevent this adverse effect in patients or improve the nerve regeneration, once it is established. Experimental models, particularly using rats and mice, are useful to investigate the mechanisms related to axonal or neuronal degeneration and target loss of function induced by neurotoxic drugs, as well as to test new strategies to prevent the development of neuropathy and to improve functional restitution. Therefore, objective and reliable methods should be applied for the assessment of function and innervation in adequately designed in vivo studies of CIPN, taking into account the impact of age, sex and species/strains features. This review gives an overview of the most useful methods to assess sensory, motor and autonomic functions, electrophysiological and morphological tests in rodent models of peripheral neuropathy, focused on CIPN. We include as well a proposal of protocols that may improve the quality and comparability of studies undertaken in different laboratories. It is recommended to apply more than one functional method for each type of function, and to perform parallel morphological studies in the same targets and models.",Paola Alberti;Aina Calls-Cobos;Martial Caillaud;M Imad Damaj;Xavier Navarro
1035,Batsheva R Rubin,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a chronic sleep disorder characterized by repetitive reduction or cessation of airflow during sleep, is widely prevalent and is associated with adverse neurocognitive sequelae including increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In humans, OSA is more common in elderly males. OSA is characterized by sleep fragmentation and chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) and recent epidemiological studies point to CIH as the best predictor of neurocognitive sequelae associated with OSA. The sex- and age- specific effects of OSA-associated CIH on specific cell populations such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons in the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), regions important for cognitive function, remain largely unknown. The present study examined the effect of 35 days of either moderate (10% oxygen) or severe (5% oxygen) CIH on GABAergic neurons in the mPFC and hippocampus of young and aged male and female mice as well as post-accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) female mice. In the mPFC and hippocampus, the number of GABA-labeled neurons increased in aged and young severe CIH males compared to controls but not in young moderate CIH males. This change was not representative of the individual GABAergic cell subpopulations, as the number of parvalbumin-labeled neurons decreased while the number of somatostatin-labeled neurons increased in the hippocampus of severe CIH young males only. In all female groups, the number of GABA-labeled cells was not different between CIH and controls. However, in the mPFC, CIH increased the number of parvalbumin-labeled neurons in young females and the number of somatostatin-labeled cells in AOF females but decreased the number of somatostatin-labeled cells in aged females. In the hippocampus, CIH decreased the number of somatostatin-labeled neurons in young females. CIH decreased the density of vesicular GABA transporter in the mPFC of AOF females only. These findings suggest sex-specific changes in GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus and mPFC with males showing an increase of this cell population as compared to their female counterparts following CIH. Age at exposure and severity of CIH also differentially affect the GABAergic cell population in mice.",Teresa A Milner;Virginia M Pickel;Christal G Coleman;Jose Marques-Lopes;Tracey A Van Kempen;Syed Faraz Kazim;Bruce S McEwen;Jason D Gray;Ana C Pereira
1036,Nina Klimova,"Global cerebral ischemia depletes brain tissue NAD+, an essential cofactor for mitochondrial and cellular metabolism, leading to bioenergetics failure and cell death. The post-ischemic NAD+ levels can be replenished by the administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which serves as a precursor for NAD+ synthesis. We have shown that NMN administration shows dramatic protection against ischemic brain damage and inhibits post-ischemic hippocampal mitochondrial fragmentation. To understand the mechanism of NMN-induced modulation of mitochondrial dynamics and neuroprotection we used our transgenic mouse models that express mitochondria targeted yellow fluorescent protein in neurons (mito-eYFP) and mice that carry knockout of mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirt3 gene (SIRT3KO). Following ischemic insult, the mitochondrial NAD+ levels were depleted leading to an increase in mitochondrial protein acetylation, high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and excessive mitochondrial fragmentation. Administration of a single dose of NMN normalized hippocampal mitochondria NAD+ pools, protein acetylation, and ROS levels. These changes were dependent on SIRT3 activity, which was confirmed using SIRT3KO mice. Ischemia induced increase in acetylation of the key mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) that resulted in inhibition of its activity. This was reversed after NMN treatment followed by reduction of ROS generation and suppression of mitochondrial fragmentation. Specifically, we found that the interaction of mitochondrial fission protein, pDrp1(S616), with neuronal mitochondria was inhibited in NMN treated ischemic mice. Our data thus provide a novel link between mitochondrial NAD+ metabolism, ROS production, and mitochondrial fragmentation. Using NMN to target these mechanisms could represent a new therapeutic approach for treatment of acute brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases.",Adam Fearnow;Aaron Long;Tibor Kristian
1037,Jenna-Lynn Senger,"Postoperative electrical stimulation (PES) improves nerve regeneration by decreasing staggered regeneration at the coaptation site. By contrast, conditioning (preoperative) electrical stimulation (CES) accelerates axon extension. Given that both techniques can be delivered at the bedside, a direct comparison of outcomes is of significant clinical importance. In this study, we compared regeneration and reinnervation outcomes of CES, PES, a combination of CES and PES, and a no stimulation control. Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into i) CES, ii) PES, iii) CES + PES, and iv) no stimulation. CES was delivered one week prior to nerve cut/coaptation, and PES was delivered immediately following nerve repair. Length of nerve regeneration was assessed at 7 days post-coaptation (n = 6/cohort), and behavioral testing was performed biweekly between 6 and 8 weeks post-coaptation (n = 8/cohort). Animals treated with CES had significantly longer axon extension and improved sensorimotor recovery compared to all other cohorts. CES treated axons extended 8.5 ± 0.6 mm, significantly longer than PES (5.5 ± 0.5 mm), CES + PES (3.6 ± 0.7 mm), or no stimulation (2.7 ± 0.5 mm) (p < .001). Sensory recovery (von Frey filament testing, intraepidermal nerve fiber reinnervation) (p < .001) and motor reinnervation (horizontal ladder, gait analysis, nerve conduction studies, neuromuscular junction analysis) (p < .05 - p < .001) were significantly improved in CES animals. CES significantly improves regeneration and reinnervation beyond the current clinical paradigm of PES. The combination of CES and PES does not have a synergistic effect. CES alone therefore may be a more promising treatment to improve outcomes in patients undergoing nerve repair surgeries.",K Ming Chan;Christine A Webber

1039,Eric Drebitz,"BACKGROUND
Electrical stimulation is a widely used method in the neurosciences with a variety of application fields. However, stimulation frequently induces large and long-lasting artifacts, which superimpose on the actual neuronal signal. Existing methods were developed for analyzing fast events such as spikes, but are not well suited for the restoration of LFP signals.


NEW METHOD
We developed a method that extracts artifact components while also leaving the LFP components of the neuronal signal intact. We based it on an exponential fit of the average artifact shape, which is subsequently adapted to the individual artifacts amplitude and then subtracted. Importantly, we used for fitting of the individual artifact only a short initial time window, in which the artifact is dominating the superimposition with the neuronal signal. Using this short period ensures that LFP components are not part of the fit, which leaves them unaffected by the subsequent artifact removal.


RESULTS
By using the method presented here, we could diminish the substantial distortions of neuronal signals caused by electrical stimulation to levels that were statistically indistinguishable from the original data. Furthermore, the effect of stimulation on the phases of γ- and β- oscillations was reduced by 85 and 75 %, respectively.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS
This approach avoids signal loss as caused by methods cutting out artifacts and minimizes the distortion of the signal's temporal structure as compared to other approaches.


CONCLUSION
The method presented here allows for a successful reconstruction of broad-band signals.",Lukas-Paul Rausch;Andreas K Kreiter
1040,Kuo Zhang,"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays the pivotal roles in central nervous system diseases. Recently, it has been reported that levetiracetam (LEV), a new antiepileptic drug with novel chemical construction and unique pharmacological properties, suppressed aberrant adult subventricular zone (SGZ) neurogenesis in kainite-induced epileptic mice, while promoted adult SGZ neuroblast differentiation in normal mice. These studies indicate LEV can modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis, but the exact mechanism remained unknown. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of subchronic and chronic LEV treatments on neural stem cell by lineage tracing in adult hippocampal dentate gyrus of mice, as well as the potential mechanism related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The data showed that both subchronic and chronic LEV treatments had no effects on body weight, locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior in mice. Notably, subchronic LEV treatment significantly suppressed the proliferation of intermediate progenitor cell and neuroblast, decreased the number of intermediate progenitor cell and neuroblast, but increased the number of quiescent neural stem cell. On the contrary, chronic LEV treatment promoted the proliferation of neural stem cell, intermediate progenitor cell and neuroblast, increased the number of neural stem cell, intermediate progenitor cell and neuroblast, and promoted differentiation of newborn immature neuron and mature neuron. Furthermore, subchronic LEV treatment decreased the level of Wnt 3a and nuclear β-Catenin expression, which led to the inhibition on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Chronic LEV treatment increased the level of Wnt 3a, cytosolic β-catenin and nuclear β-Catenin, decreased the expression of GSK-3β, p-Tyr216-GSK-3β and Axin2, resulting in the enhancement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These results demonstrated that LEV significantly suppressed or promoted adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice by subchronic or chronic treatment possibly through the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings provided the new perspectives of LEV on adult hippocampal neurogenesis underlying its clinical application.",Fan Wang;Yang Zhao;Meiyao He;Yuanchao Luo;Yue Cheng;Jing Luo;Zhimei Li;Jingyu Yang

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of acute caffeine consumption on cognitive, physical, occupational and driving performance in sleep deprived/restricted individuals. 45 publications providing 327 effect estimates (EEs) were included in the review. Caffeine improved response time (44 EEs; g = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.53-0.83) and accuracy (27 EEs; g = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.48-0.88) on attention tests, improved executive function (38 EEs; g = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.15-0.55), improved reaction time (12 EEs; g = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.75-1.47), improved response time (20 EEs; g = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.39-2.52) and accuracy (34 EEs; g = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.30-0.55) on information processing tasks, and enhanced lateral (29 EEs; g = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.32-2.02) and longitudinal (12 EEs; g = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.16-2.03) measures of vehicular control on driving tests.

Fifteen articles met the eligibility criteria. The review shows that in studies of NP involving animal models of SCI, rodents are the most common species. Thoracic contusion is the most common injury and mechanical and thermal nociception are the most frequently assessed NP components. The benefits of physical exercise vary according to its starting period and total duration. In addition, there is considerable heterogeneity regarding the type and intensity of exercise capable of alleviating NP after SCI. Furthermore, physical exercise has beneficial effects on mechanical, thermal and cold nociception, and spontaneous pain.

1043,Victoria C Seghatol-Eslami,"Deficits in social communication in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been documented using neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI over the past decade. More recently, functional connectivity MRI has revealed altered connectivity in face processing, mentalizing, and mirroring brain networks, networks involved in the social brain in ASD. However, to our knowledge, previous studies have not examined these three networks concurrently. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the functional connectivity of the face processing, mentalizing, and mirroring networks (within each network and across networks) in ASD during an action-intention task in which participants were asked to determine the means and intention of a model's actions. We examined: a) within-network connectivity of each network using an ROI-to-ROI analysis; b) connectivity of each network hub to the rest of the brain using a seed-to-voxel analysis; c) the between-network connectivity of each network hub using ROI-to-ROI analysis; and d) brain-behavior relationships by correlating autism symptoms with brain connectivity. Task-fMRI data were used from 21 participants with ASD and 20 typically developing participants.

1045,Jihyun Kim,"Stroke is one of the most-devastating brain diseases causing acute death or permanent disability. Although tissue-type plasminogen activator was approved by Food and Drug Administration for early reperfusion of the occluded vessels, oxidative injury may cause extensive brain infarction. Accordingly, there is a need for effective neuroprotection during reperfusion, and stem cell-based therapeutic approaches should fulfill this requirement. We established human neural stem cells (NSCs) encoding gene of choline acetyltransferase (F3.ChAT), an acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, and investigated whether infusion of the F3.ChAT cells attenuate the ischemia-reperfusion brain damage in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). F3.ChAT cells were found to produce much higher amounts of ChAT as well as neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory neurotrophins than their parental F3 NSCs. After 2 -h occlusion, the artery was reperfused, along with intravenous infusion of the stem cells (1 × 106 cells/rat). Administration of the F3.ChAT cells markedly reduced the infarction volume and improved both the cognitive dysfunction and behavioural deficits of MCAO animals, in which F3.ChAT cells were superior to F3 cells. F3.ChAT cells not only restored microtubule-associated protein-2, a neuronal cytoskeletal protein, and preserved microvessels, but also suppressed lipid peroxidation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in the brain tissues. The results demonstrate that early intravenous infusion of NSCs expressing ChAT and neurotrophins attenuate brain and capillary injuries and restore neurobehavioural functions via neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities, and that F3.ChAT cells could be a candidate for the neuroprotection and functional recovery of acute stroke patients.",Kyungha Shin;Yeseul Cha;Young-Hwan Ban;Sung Kyeong Park;Heon Sang Jeong;Dongsun Park;Ehn-Kyoung Choi;Yun-Bae Kim
1046,Charles V Vorhees,"The importance of litter effects (clustering of variance among offspring in rodents) has been known for decades. The standard approach was to treat the entire litter a unit or to select one male and one female from each litter to prevent oversampling. These methods work but are imperfect. Treating the litter as a whole fails to use valuable interindividual differences among offspring, and selecting representative pups fails to use all the data available. Golub and Sobin [Ref] address this using a better method. They show that using litter as a random factor in mixed linear models resolves this conundrum. As they demonstrate, such models control for litter clustering by partitioning litter variance from error variance. This reduces error variance and increases the power of F-tests of the independent variable(s). In our experience, this is the optimal solution. But as good as mixed linear models are when used with litter as a random factor, if other aspects of the experimental design are not appropriate, this cannot compensate for threats to validity from small sample sizes, dams not strictly randomly assigned to groups, repeated measure covariance structures not appropriately modeled, interactions not properly sliced, or a posteriori group comparisons not controlled for multiple comparisons. Appropriate handling of litter is only one consideration of experimental design and statistical analysis that when used in combination lead to valid, reproducible data.",Michael T Williams

1048,Ghanashyam D Ghadge,"Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause ~20% of familial ALS (FALS), which comprises 10% of total ALS cases. In mutant SOD1- (mtSOD1-) induced ALS, misfolded aggregates of SOD1 lead to activation of the unfolded protein response/integrated stress response (UPR/ISR). Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), a kinase that phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiator factor 2α (p-eIF2α), coordinates the response by causing a global suppression of protein synthesis. Growth arrest and DNA damage 34 (GADD34) dephosphorylates p-eIF2α, allowing protein synthesis to return to normal. If the UPR/ISR is overwhelmed by the amount of misfolded protein, CCAAT/enhancer-binding homologous protein (CHOP) is activated leading to apoptosis. In the current study we investigated the effect of knocking down CHOP and GADD34 on disease of G93A and G85R mtSOD1 mice. Although a CHOP antisense oligonucleotide had no effect on survival, an intravenous injection of GADD34 shRNA encoded in adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) into neonatal G93A as well as neonatal G85R mtSOD1 mice led to a significantly increased survival. G85R mtSOD1 mice had a reduction in SOD1 aggregates/load, astrocytosis, and microgliosis. In contrast, there was no change in disease phenotype when GADD34 shRNA was delivered to older G93A mtSOD1 mice. Our current study shows that GADD34 shRNA is effective in ameliorating disease when administered to neonatal mtSOD1 mice. Targeting the UPR/ISR may be beneficial in mtSOD1-induced ALS as well as other neurodegenerative diseases in which misfolded proteins and ER stress have been implicated.",Yoshifumi Sonobe;Adrian Camarena;Claire Drigotas;Frank Rigo;Karen K Ling;Raymond P Roos
1049,Dongming Yang,"Evidence of the gut microbiota influencing neurodegenerative diseases has been reported for several neural diseases. However, there is little insight regarding the relationship between the gut microbiota and prion disease. Here, using fecal samples of 12 prion-infected mice and 25 healthy controls, we analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and metabolic changes by 16S rRNA sequencing and LC-MS-based metabolomics respectively as multi-omic analyses. Additionally, SCFAs and common amino acids were detected by GC-MS and UPLC respectively. Enteric changes induced by prion disease affected both structure and abundances of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota of infected mice displayed greater numbers of Proteobacteria and less Saccharibacteria at the phylum level and more Lactobacillaceae and Helicobacteraceae and less Prevotellaceae and Ruminococcaceae at the family level. A total of 145 fecal metabolites were found to be significantly different in prion infection, and most (114) of these were lipid metabolites. Using KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, we found that 3 phosphatidylcholine (PC) compounds significantly decreased and 4 hydrophobic bile acids significantly increased. Decreases of 8 types of short-chain acids (SCFAs) and increases of Cys and Tyr and decreases of His, Trp, and Arg were observed in prion infection. Correlation analysis indicated that the gut microbiota changes observed in our study may have been the shared outcome of prion disease.

1050,Monray E Williams,"HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments (HANI) are a spectrum of neurological disorders due to the effects of HIV-1 on the central nervous system (CNS). The HIV-1 subtypes; HIV-1 subtype B (HIV-1B) and HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) are responsible for the highest prevalence of HANI and HIV infections respectively. The HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein is a major contributor to the neuropathogenesis of HIV. The effects of the Tat protein on cells of the CNS is determined by the subtype-associated amino acid sequence variations. The extent to which the sequence variation between Tat-subtypes contribute to underlying mechanisms and neurological outcomes are not clear. In this review of the literature, we discuss how amino acid variations between HIV-1B Tat (TatB) and HIV-1C Tat (TatC) proteins contribute to the potential underlying neurobiological mechanisms of HANI. Tat-C is considered to be a more effective transactivator, whereas Tat-B may exert increased neurovirulence, including neuronal apoptosis, monocyte infiltration into the brain, (neuro)inflammation, oxidative stress and blood-brain barrier damage. These findings support the premise that Tat variants from different HIV-1 subtypes may direct neurovirulence and neurological outcomes in HANI.",Simo S Zulu;Dan J Stein;John A Joska;Petrus J W Naudé
1051,Michael X Henderson,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases for which there is no disease-modifying treatment. PD and DLB are characterized by aggregation of the synaptic protein α-synuclein, and there is compelling evidence to suggest that progression of these diseases is associated with the trans-cellular spread of pathogenic α-synuclein through the brains of afflicted individuals. Therapies targeting extracellular, pathogenic α-synuclein may therefore hold promise for slowing or halting disease progression. In this regard, it has been suggested that highly-selective antibodies can be administered as therapeutic agents targeting pathogenic proteins. In the current study, we screened a series of antibodies using multiple selection criterion to identify those that selectively bind pathogenic α-synuclein and show potent inhibition of pathology seeding in a neuronal model of α-synucleinopathy. A lead antibody was tested in a mouse model of PD, and it was able to reduce the spread of α-synuclein pathology in the brain and attenuate dopamine reductions in the striatum. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of α-synuclein immunotherapy for the treatment of PD and DLB, and provides a framework for screening of α-synuclein antibodies to identify those with preferred properties.",Dustin J Covell;Charlotte Hiu-Yan Chung;Rose M Pitkin;Raizel M Sandler;Samantha C Decker;Dawn M Riddle;Bin Zhang;Ronald J Gathagan;Michael J James;John Q Trojanowski;Kurt R Brunden;Virginia M Y Lee;Kelvin C Luk
1052,Hea-Jong Chung,"The main pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the presence of Lewy bodies, which mainly consist of aggregated α-synuclein. Based on the neurotoxicity of oligomeric α-synuclein and its significance in the aetiology of PD, there has been decades of effort to elucidate an enzyme specifically degrading oligomeric α-synuclein. Here we report an enzyme, Omi, which specifically recognizes and precisely degrades oligomeric α-synuclein but not monomeric α-synuclein. After enzymatic and functional analyses of Omi in in vitro, we developed an in vivo assay system of dual gene interaction in Drosophila to investigate further the etiological role of Omi in PD. Pan-neuronal expression of Omi rescued Parkinsonism in a Drosophila model of PD, while Knockout of Omi exacerbated Parkinsonism. Expression of Omi counteracted the α-synuclein-induced retinal degeneration, providing additional evidence for Omi's protective role oligomeric α-synuclein. This work reports identification of the catabolic pathway of oligomeric α-synuclein as well as showing how Omi functions as the key molecule in the recognition and degradation of toxic oligomeric α-synuclein, a possible cause of neurodegeneration in PD, without affecting monomeric α-synuclein which is a native essential molecule for the normal function of neurons.",Md Saidul Islam;Md Mashiar Rahman;Seong-Tshool Hong
1053,Lindsay E Stoyka,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is defined by motor symptoms such as tremor at rest, bradykinesia, postural instability, and stiffness. In addition to the classical motor defects that define PD, up to 80% of patients experience cognitive changes and psychiatric disturbances, referred to as PD dementia (PDD). Pathologically, PD is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and intracellular inclusions, called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, composed mostly of α-synuclein. Much of PD research has focused on the role of α-synuclein aggregates in degeneration of SNpc dopamine neurons because of the impact of loss of striatal dopamine on the classical motor phenotypes. However, abundant Lewy pathology is also found in other brain regions including the cortex and limbic brain regions such as the amygdala, which may contribute to non-motor phenotypes. Little is known about the consequences of α-synuclein inclusions in these brain regions, or in neuronal subtypes other than dopamine neurons. This project expands knowledge on how α-synuclein inclusions disrupt behavior, specifically non-motor symptoms of synucleinopathies. We show that bilateral injections of fibrils into the striatum results in robust bilateral α-synuclein inclusion formation in the cortex and amygdala. Inclusions in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex primarily localize to excitatory neurons. Unbiased stereology shows no significant loss of neurons in the amygdala or cortex. Fibril injected mice show defects in a social dominance behavioral task and fear conditioning; tasks that are associated with prefrontal cortex and amygdala function. Together, these observations suggest that seeded α-synuclein inclusion formation impairs behaviors associated with cortical and amygdala function, without causing cell loss, in brain areas that may play important roles in the complex cognitive features of PDD.",Andrew E Arrant;Drake R Thrasher;Dreson L Russell;Jennifer Freire;Casey L Mahoney;Ashwin Narayanan;Aseel G Dib;David G Standaert;Laura A Volpicelli-Daley
1054,Waegaert Robin,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia are two neurodegenerative diseases with currently no cure. These two diseases share a clinical continuum with overlapping genetic causes. Mutations in the CHMP2B gene are found in patients with ALS, FTD and ALS-FTD. To highlight deregulated mechanisms occurring in ALS-FTD linked to the CHMP2B gene, we performed a whole transcriptomic study on lumbar spinal cord from CHMP2Bintron5 mice, a model that develops progressive motor alterations associated with dementia symptoms reminiscent of both ALS and FTD. To gain insight into the transcriptomic changes taking place during disease progression this study was performed at three stages: asymptomatic, symptomatic and end stage. We showed that before appearance of motor symptoms, the major disrupted mechanisms were linked with the immune system/inflammatory response and lipid metabolism. These processes were progressively replaced by alterations of neuronal electric activity as motor symptoms appeared, alterations that could lead to motor neuron dysfunction. To investigate overlapping alterations in gene expression between two ALS-causing genes, we then compared the transcriptome of symptomatic CHMP2Bintron5 mice with the one of symptomatic SOD1G86R mice and found the same families deregulated providing further insights into common underlying dysfunction of biological pathways, disrupted or disturbed in ALS. Altogether, this study provides a database to explore potential new candidate genes involved in the CHMP2Bintron5-based pathogenesis of ALS, and provides molecular clues to further understand the functional consequences that diseased neurons expressing CHMP2B mutant may have on their neighbor cells.",Dirrig-Grosch Sylvie;Parisot Florian;Keime Céline;Henriques Alexandre;Loeffler Jean-Philippe;René Frédérique
1055,Qinbiao Li,"OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to assess the effects of the multisensory rehabilitation product for stroke patients on cortical activation response through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).


METHODS
The music rehabilitation glove (MRG), multisensory rehabilitation product, was developed with a user-centered design concept. The 40-channel NIRS system monitored the cortical activation changes in the motor cortex (MC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), temporal lobe (TL) and occipital lobe (OL) of 22 young subjects during ""sequential finger-to-thumb opposition movements (SFTOM)"" phase of traditional training and ""musical finger-to-thumb opposition movements (MFTOM)"" phase of MRG training.


RESULTS
The two phases of training showed significant activation (P < 0.05) in the cerebral cortex compared with baseline, with more activation during MFTOM in the MC, PFC and TL. Compared with SFTOM, there were 22 channels of cortical activation in MFTOM that had significant enhancements (P < 0.05). There was also a significant positive correlation between the prefrontal cortex and motor cortex in the cortical activation.


CONCLUSIONS
According to these results, MFTOM-induced cortical activation in the MC, PFC and TL with visual, auditory and tactile stimuli was stronger than SFTOM, providing evidence that the multisensory stimulation is more beneficial to cortical activation and cognitive control to promote neurological recovery.",Jian Feng;Jia Guo;Zilin Wang;Puhong Li;Heshan Liu;Zhijun Fan
1056,Manhua Liu,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain degenerative disorder. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical precursor of AD. Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and DenseNet models are combined to classify disease status. Our method is evaluated on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data collected from 97 AD, 233 MCI, 119 Normal Control (NC) subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The proposed method achieves a dice similarity coefficient of 87.0% for hippocampal segmentation. In addition, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.9% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.5% for classifying AD vs. NC subjects, and an accuracy of 76.2% and an AUC of 77.5% for classifying MCI vs. NC subjects. Our empirical study also demonstrates that the proposed multi-model method outperforms the single-model methods and several other competing methods.",Fan Li;Hao Yan;Kundong Wang;Yixin Ma;Li Shen;Mingqing Xu; 
1057,Pengfei Han,"Taste sensitivity relates to food preferences and macronutrients intake. The current study investigated whether the neural responses to food odors varied in sensory quality (sweet or non-sweet) and their associations with macronutrient content (high- or low-fat) in young healthy participants varied in sweet taste sensitivity. Thirty-eight participants were assessed for their sensitivity to sucrose solutions using a modified ""taste strip"" test. They were divided into high sweetness sensitive (HS, n = 15) and low sweetness sensitive (LS, n = 15) groups using the median split approach. Brain responses to four food-related odors (chocolate, peach, peanut, and bread) and one non-food odor (rose) were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Preferences for tastes and macronutrients were measured using a computer-based task. Behavioral results showed that HS group, compared to LS group, had a higher preference for carbohydrate-dominated foods and liking for sweet foods, but a lower liking for protein-dominated foods. The food odors, in comparison to non-food odors, produced greater brain-activations in the gustatory and reward regions. Compared to LS group, the HS group showed a higher level of activation in the frontal inferior operculum in response to sweet vs. savory food odors, and stronger insular activations to high-fat vs. low-fat food odors. In addition, individual sweetness sensitivity was positively associated with activation of the insula in response to chocolate odor, suggesting an overlap of neural responses to food odor with high sugar and fat content. Our findings highlight that high sensitivity to sweetness can be associated with increased preference for carbohydrate-dominated or sweet foods, and elevated brain activations to sweet or high-fat food odors in the areas related to food reward processing.",Mohebbat Mohebbi;Han-Seok Seo;Thomas Hummel
1058,Sam Reiter,"Visual perception is inherently statistical: brains exploit repeating features of natural scenes to disambiguate images that could, in principle, have many causes. A clear case for the relevance of statistical inference in vision is animal camouflage. Although visual scenes are each composed of unique arrangements of pixels, they are usually perceived mainly as groupings of statistically defined patches (sandy/leafy/smooth etc…); this fact is exploited by camouflaging animals. The unique ability of certain cephalopods to camouflage actively within many different surroundings provides a rare and direct behavioral readout for texture perception. In addition, because cephalopods and chordates each arose after a phylogenetic split that occurred some 600M years ago, the apparent convergence of texture perception across these groups suggests common principles. Studying cephalopod camouflage may thus help us resolve general problems of visual perception.",Gilles Laurent

The expression of defensive behaviors and the fast and long-lasting changes in behaviors accompanying defeat must be supported by a complex neural circuit.

Over the last several decades, both kyphoplasty (PKP) and vertebroplasty (PVP) have been used for pain relief in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF). The purpose of our study was to use citation analysis to identify and review the top 100 most-cited publications regarding PKP and PVP.


METHODS
All databases of the Web of Science were searched using the keywords ""kyphoplasty"" and ""vertebroplasty"". All publications with greater than 100 citations were identified and the results were ranked in descending order of citations. The 100 most-cited publications were included for analysis.


RESULTS
A total of 6,271 publications on PKP and PVP were identified. The number of citations of the 100 most-cited studies ranged from 735 to 109, with a mean of 225.3 citations per study. The most productive period was 2001-2010, which produced 79 out of the top 100 publications. Thirteen journals published these 100 studies, with the journal Spine publishing the largest number (23) of studies. Most of the identified papers originated in the United States, with France and Switzerland found to be the next most heavily represented countries of origin out of the eleven countries that produced them. Most of the studies focused on treatment of OVCF, followed by pathologic fractures caused by tumors.


CONCLUSION
We identified the 100 most-cited publications on PKP and PVP and performed a bibliometric analysis characterizing distinguishing features of these studies. This list can help guide clinical decision-making and future research directions as clinicians and researchers continue to explore these controversial therapeutic techniques.",Tingxiao Zhao;Jay S Reidler;Xinji Chen;Hengwei Zhang;Haiyu Shao;Mengran Jin;Jun Zhang
1062,Masashi Kuwabara,"BACKGROUND
Cerebral embolism after carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a well-known complication, but cerebral ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm after CAS is rare and has seldom been reported. We describe a patient with transient ischemic complications due to reversible cerebral vasospasm of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) after CAS.


CLINICAL DESCRIPTION
A 74-year-old man presented with right hemiparesis by acutely scattered brain infarction in the left cerebral hemisphere. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed severe stenosis of the left cervical internal carotid artery origin. CAS under a distal filter protection was performed without any intraprocedural complications, but 12 hours later, the patient had aphasia and Gerstmann syndrome. Urgent magnetic resonance image revealed no evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage or new cerebral infarction. However, MRA showed diffuse vasospasm of the left MCA. His symptoms and imaging findings improved gradually by conservative treatment. The patient was discharged without new neurological deficits and recurrent attack in 3 weeks after CAS.

In many cases, an injury to the head leads to the replacement of a part of the skull with such materials as titanium and polyether ether ketone (PEEK).


METHODS
Three-dimensional heads model of 15 healthy subjects and 13 patients were prepared. The models were simulated using thermal-FSI analysis to evaluate the effects of cold (5°C) and hot (55°C) temperatures of the skull on the conditions of blood flow in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA).


RESULTS
The results showed negligible changes (<3%) in wall shear stress (WSS) vessel and von Mises stress between the healthy subjects and patients both at 25°C and 55°C. However, at 5°C, the values of these two parameters in the patient were 2.1 and 2.5 times those in healthy subjects, respectively. The value of WSS in healthy subjects and the patients in cold temperature was 1.2 and 2.9 times those at normal temperature. The corresponding values for von Mises stress were 1.1 add 2.2, respectively. Accordingly, the stress changes between cold and hot ambient temperatures were found to be negligible in all samples.


CONCLUSIONS
The changes in stress were significant only for the patient when exposed to cold ambient temperature and only in patients, exposure to a cold ambient temperature significantly increased the risks of vascular aneurysm and damage to the brain tissue surrounding the blood vessels. These risks were found to be negligible for both healthy subjects and patients when exposed to hot ambient temperature and also for healthy subjects exposed to cold ambient temperature.",Seifollah Gholampour

To investigate functional outcome from reconstructive surgery in adult traumatic brachial plexus injury (AT-BPI) with associated vascular lesions.


METHODS
A retrospective review was performed of 325 patients with AT-BPI who underwent reconstructive surgery between 2001 and 2012. Patients with (vascular) and without (control) vascular injuries were identified by review of medical documentation. Patient presentation, characteristics of nerve and associated lesions, and surgical management were evaluated to identify prognostic variables. Postoperative muscle strength, range of motion, and patient-reported disability scores were analyzed to determine long-term outcome.


RESULTS
Sixty-eight patients had a concomitant vascular injury. There were no significant differences in age or sex between the control and vascular groups. Vascular patients were more likely to have pan-plexus lesions (p<0.0001), with significantly more associated upper extremity injuries (p<0.0001). The control group underwent more nerve transfers whereas vascular patients underwent more nerve grafting (p=0.003). Complete outcomes data were obtained in 139 patients, which included 111 control (43% of all controls) and 28 vascular patients (41%). There was no significant difference in patient-reported disability scores between the two groups. However, 73% of controls had grade 3 or greater postoperative elbow flexion while only 43% of vascular patients achieved these strengths (p=0.003). Control patients demonstrated a greater increase in strength of shoulder abduction as well (p=0.004). Shoulder external rotation strength was grade 0 in the majority of patients, with no difference between the two groups.

Pharmacologically induced EEG silence increases tolerance of ischemic period by reducing cerebral metabolism. We hypothesised that sevoflurane, a cerebral vasodilator, will maintain cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) better than propofol, a cerebral vasoconstrictor, during EEG silence. To validate this, we compared the effect of sevoflurane and propofol on CBF and CMRO2 during surgical plane of anaesthesia (SP) and burst suppression on EEG (BS).


METHODS
We conducted a prospective, double blinded trial, where patients undergoing neurosurgery were randomised to receive propofol or sevoflurane. Mean velocity (MV) and pulsatility index (PI) of bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCA) were measured as surrogate of CBF. Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) and arterio-venous oxygen difference (AjvDO2) were obtained to assess CMRO2. The values were compared between groups using student t test and within the group with ANOVA at SP and BS.


RESULTS
- BS decreased MV and increased PI in propofol group (p<0.001 and p<0.02 on normal side, p<0.004 and p<0.001 on tumor side). There was no significant change in sevoflurane group. BS with sevoflurane increased SjvO2 (p<0.001) and decreased AjvDO2 (p<0.001). Change in SjvO2 and AjvDO2 with propofol at SP and BS was variable.


CONCLUSION
In our study, sevoflurane had a safer profile on cerebral oxygenation during BS while not altering the CBF, suggesting increased availability of oxygen. Propofol, on the other hand, produced cerebral vasoconstriction with BS. The effect of propofol on oxygenation was unpredictable, with low SjvO2 and high AjvDO2 even at surgical plane of anesthesia.",Appavoo Arulvelan;George Chandy Vilanilam

Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVM) are rare vascular lesions. Recent observations challenge the congenital nature of these lesions. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with dynamic changes of bAVM still remain unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the potential role of COL4A2 (Collagen alpha-2(IV)) in the pathophysiology of bAVM.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Expression and localization of COL4A2 were analyzed on tissue microarrays from bAVM patients (n = 60) by immunohistochemistry. Correlations between COL4A2 levels and clinical parameters were examined with Pearson's test for normally- distibuted or Spearman's Rho for not normally distributed data. Comparison between different clinical parameters was performed using t-test, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal- Wallis test. Fisher's exact test was used for categorical data.


RESULTS
COL4A2 was mainly expressed beneath the endothelium of vessels in the tunica media of bAVM. This pattern of expression indicates the basement membrane of the vessel walls. High levels of COL4A2 expression correlated with the age at surgery of patients (p = 0.005; R = 0.393; Spearman's Rho). The age at surgery in young (17-25 years) and old patients (55-76 years) showed a linear correlation; a greater variance of COL4A2 expression was observed in the age group between 26-54 years.


CONCLUSION
This study reports for the first time the expression of COL4A2 in bAVM and suggests a potential role of COL4A2 in bAVM pathophysiology. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the microenvironment of bAVM and may foster the development of improved therapeutic strategies for this disease.",Klaus-Peter Stein;Ludwig Wilkens;Homajoun Maslehaty;Claudia A Dumitru;I Erol Sandalcioglu

The practice of ≥24 h of bed rest after acute ischemic stroke thrombolysis is common among hospitals, but its value compared to shorter periods of bed rest is unknown.


METHODS
Consecutive adult patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke who had received intravenous thrombolysis treatment from 1/1/2010 until 4/13/2016, identified from the local ischemic stroke registry, were included. Standard practice bed rest for ≥24 h, the protocol prior to 1/27/2014, was retrospectively compared with standard practice bed rest for ≥12 h, the protocol after that date. The primary outcome was favorable discharge location (defined as home, home with services, or acute rehabilitation). Secondary outcome measures included incidence of pneumonia, NIHSS at discharge, and length of stay.


RESULTS
392 patients were identified (203 in the ≥24 h group, 189 in the ≥12 h group). There was no significant difference in favorable discharge outcome in the ≥24 h bed rest protocol compared with the ≥12 h bed rest protocol in multivariable logistic regression analysis (76.2% vs. 70.9%, adjusted OR 1.20 CI 0.71-2.03).

Acute phase hyperglycemia is independently associated with an increased risk of death and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) in stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Whether postoperative hyperglycemia is an independent predictor of sICH after endovascular therapy remains unknown. Here, we assessed whether hyperglycemia after endovascular therapy can predict sICH.


METHODS
Consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy with or without subsequent stent implantation were analyzed. The primary outcome was the occurrence of sICH within the first 7 days after endovascular treatment. The second outcome was other forms of hemorrhagic transformation (HT), including parenchymal hematoma (PH) and parenchymal hematoma type 2 (PH-2).


RESULTS
One hundred and fifty-six patients were included. Fifteen patients (9.62%) developed sICH after endovascular therapy. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, postoperative glucose values were independently associated with sICH after endovascular therapy. Furthermore, adding postoperative glucose values to conventional risk factors led to a substantial reclassification for sICH following endovascular therapy (net reclassification improvement = 28.1%; p = .014). Moreover, postoperative glucose values were found to be risk factors for PH-2.


CONCLUSIONS
We found that postoperative glucose values might be an independent risk factor for sICH in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who are treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Adding postoperative glucose values to conventional risk factors could improve risk stratification for sICH following endovascular therapy.",Yi Ren;Xiuying Cui;Ping Liu;Fei Chen;Haiping Zhao;Ziping Han;Yuyou Huang;Qingfeng Ma;Yumin Luo

Here, we took advantage of a novel optogenetic tool (opto-DN-CREB) (Ali et al. Chem Biol 22:1531-1539, 2015) to gain spatial and temporal control of CREB function in freely behaving mice. We found increasing CREB function in a small, random population of LA principal neurons in the minutes-hours, but not 24 h, before training was sufficient to enhance memory, likely because these neurons were preferentially allocated to the underlying engram. However, similarly increasing CREB activity in a small population of random LA neurons immediately after training disrupted subsequent memory retrieval, likely by disrupting the precise spatial and temporal patterns of offline post-training neuronal activity and/or function required for consolidation. These findings reveal the importance of the timing of CREB activity in regulating allocation and subsequent memory retrieval, and further, highlight the potential of optogenetic approaches to control protein function with temporal specificity in behaving animals.",Alexander D Jacob;Brandon J Walters;Sungmo Park;Asim J Rashid;Jung Hoon Jung;Jocelyn Lau;G Andrew Woolley;Paul W Frankland;Sheena A Josselyn

In recent years, the role of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in migraine pathogenesis has achieved considerable interest; however, to date findings are equivocal. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate biomarkers of oxidative stress in episodic and chronic migraineurs (EM and CM patients) and controls.


METHODS
Forty-four patients with EM, 27 individuals with CM and 19 age-sex-matched controls were enrolled. After collecting data on demographic and headache characteristics, blood samples were collected and analyzed to detect serum levels of oxidative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO)); total antioxidant capacity using Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay; and antioxidant enzymes (catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1)).


RESULTS
Serum levels of CAT and SOD were significantly lower in the CM group than the EM group and controls. However, serum GPx-1 levels of the CM patients were slightly higher than the EM patients and controls (P-value≤0.001). CM patients had lower mean TEAC values than EM patients and controls. In addition, serum levels of NO and MDA were significantly elevated among subjects with CM compared to EM and control individuals (P-value≤0.001). Pearson correlation analysis revealed negative correlations between the number of days of having headaches per month and serum concentrations of the two antioxidant enzymes CAT (r = - 0.60, P-value< 0.001) and SOD (r = - 0.50, P-value< 0.001) as well as TEAC values (r = - 0.61, P-value< 0.001); however, there were positive correlations between headache days and serum GPx-1 levels (r = 0.46, P-value< 0.001), NO (r = 0.62, P-value< 0.001), and MDA (r = 0.64, P-value< 0.001).


CONCLUSION
Present findings highlighted that chronic migraineurs had lower total non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and higher oxidative stress than episodic migraineurs and control individuals. Although more studies are needed to confirm these data, applying novel prophylactic medications or dietary supplements with antioxidant properties could be promising in migraine therapy.",Soodeh Razeghi Jahromi;Zeinab Ghorbani;Amir Ghaemi;Pegah Rafiee
1075,Kazi Farhana Afroz,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition with no known etiology or cure. Several possible contributing factors, both genetic and environmental, are being actively investigated. Amongst these, maternal immune dysregulation has been identified as potentially involved in promoting ASD in the offspring. Indeed, ASD-like behaviors have been observed in studies using the maternal immune activation mouse model. Furthermore, recent studies have shed light on maternal dietary habits and their impact on the gut microbiome as factors possibly facilitating ASD. However, most of these studies have been limited to the effects of high fat and/or high sugar. More recent data, however, have shown that elevated salt consumption has a significant effect on the immune system and gut microbiome, often resulting in gut dysbiosis and induction of pro-inflammatory pathways. Specifically, high salt alters the gut microbiome and induces the differentiation of T helper-17 cells that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-17 and interleukin-23. Moreover, elevated salt can also reduce the differentiation of regulatory T cells that help maintaining a balanced immune system. While in the innate immune system, high salt can cause over activation of M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages and downregulation of M2 regulatory macrophages. These changes to the immune system are alarming because excessive consumption of salt is a documented worldwide problem. Thus, in this review, we discuss recent findings on high salt intake, gut microbiome, and immune system dysregulation while proposing a hypothesis to link maternal overconsumption of salt and children's ASD.",Karina Alviña

Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a large group of degenerative, neurological disorders characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness. The disease was investigated precisely but still clinicians often make incorrect or late diagnosis. Our aim was to investigate the genetic background and clinical phenotype of spastic paraplegia in large Polish family.


CASE PRESENTATION
A 37 years old woman presented with 4-year history of walking difficulties. On neurological examination, she had signs of upper motor lesion in lower extremities. She denied sphincter dysfunction and her cognition was normal. Her family history was positive for individuals with gait problems. The initial diagnosis was familial spastic paraplegia. Genetic testing identified a novel mutation in SPAST gene. All available family members were examined and had genetic testing. The same mutation in SPAST gene was identified in other affected family members. All patients caring the mutation presented with different phenotypes.


CONCLUSION
This study presents a family with spastic paraplegia due to a novel mutation c.1390G›T(p.Glu464Term) in SPAST gene. Affected individuals showed a range of phenotypes that varied in their severity. This case report demonstrates, the signs of hereditary spastic paraplegia can be often misdiagnosed with other diseases. Therefore genetic testing should always be considered in patients with lower limb spasticity and positive family history in order to help to establish the correct diagnosis.",Anna Dziubek;Malgorzata Sado;Marek Karpiński;Agnieszka Gorzkowska
1077,Clifford L Eastman,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in young adults worldwide. TBI survival is associated with persistent neuropsychiatric and neurological impairments, including posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE). To date, no pharmaceutical treatment has been found to prevent PTE or ameliorate neurological/neuropsychiatric deficits after TBI. Brain trauma results in immediate mechanical damage to brain cells and blood vessels that may never be fully restored given the limited regenerative capacity of brain tissue. This primary insult unleashes cascades of events, prominently including neuroinflammation and massive oxidative stress that evolve over time, expanding the brain injury, but also clearing cellular debris and establishing homeostasis in the region of damage. Accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory sequelae of TBI contribute to posttraumatic epileptogenesis. This review will focus on possible roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS), their interactions with neuroinflammation in posttraumatic epileptogenesis, and emerging therapeutic strategies after TBI. We propose that inhibitors of the professional ROS-generating enzymes, the NADPH oxygenases and myeloperoxidase alone, or combined with selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase mediated signaling may have promise for the treatment or prevention of PTE and other sequelae of TBI.",Raimondo D'Ambrosio;Thota Ganesh
1078,Cinzia Coppola,"Progranulin gene (GRN) mutations are among the leading causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by remarkable clinical heterogeneity. In this article, we report the new GRN 708+4A>T splicing mutation, identified in 2 siblings of a family with several members affected by cognitive, behavioral, and motor disorders. Plasma progranulin dosage and GRN expression analysis, together with in silico prediction studies, supported the pathogenicity of the mutation. Both the patients displayed a clinical syndrome in which language impairment was largely predominant. However, motor speech deficits were the major feature in one case, diagnosed as progressive nonfluent aphasia, whereas marked semantic alterations were present in the other, whose clinical phenotype was in favor of a mixed aphasia. The profile of neuroanatomical alterations from imaging studies was in line with the clinical phenotypes. Therefore, also this novel GRN mutation is associated with haploinsufficiency and phenotypic heterogeneity, which are both typical features of progranulinopathies.",Mariano Oliva;Dario Saracino;Sabina Pappatà;Emilia Zampella;Sara Cimini;Martina Ricci;Giorgio Giaccone;Giuseppe Di Iorio;Giacomina Rossi
1079,An Li,"A promising intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD) would ideally target key pathological factors that are involved in AD pathogenesis. Soluble factors produced by engrafted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) mediate potential therapeutic effects in AD. However, these therapeutic benefits are largely hampered by the limited paracrine capacity of MSCs. In this study, we used adenovirus-mediated gene transduction of bone marrow MSCs to deliver exogenous proteins into the brain of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice in the early stage of impairment. We observed that engrafted MSCs carrying exogenous (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1) alone reduced the production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-ɑ and improved synapse-related protein expression but not cognitive function. Transplantation of MSCs carrying CX3CL1 and Wnt3a (CX3CL1-Wnt3a-MSC) significantly attenuated the learning and memory impairment when compared with a control group. The improvement of neurobehavioral functions in APP/PS1 mice treated with CX3CL1-Wnt3a-MSC was related to the inhibition of microglial neurotoxicity and promotion of hippocampal neurogenesis. Transplantation of CX3CL1-Wnt3a-MSC also regulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/activated protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling to inhibit the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β). Taken together, these results indicate that the delivery of exogenous proteins via MSCs can modulate microglial function and enhance neurogenesis, thereby providing new insights into AD intervention.",Jiayi Zhao;Chongzhu Fan;Lihong Zhu;Cuiqin Huang;Qin Li;Danhui Gan;Caiyan Wen;Mengfei Chen;Daxiang Lu
1080,Lidia Cabeza,"Decision-making is a conserved evolutionary process enabling us to choose one option among several alternatives, and relies on reward and cognitive control systems. The Iowa Gambling Task allows the assessment of human decision-making under uncertainty by presenting four card decks with various cost-benefit probabilities. Participants seek to maximise their monetary gain by developing long-term optimal-choice strategies. Animal versions have been adapted with nutritional rewards, but interspecies data comparisons are scarce. Our study directly compares the non-pathological decision-making performance between humans and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Human participants completed an electronic Iowa Gambling Task version, while mice a maze-based adaptation with four arms baited in a probabilistic way. Our data shows closely matching performance between both species with similar patterns of choice behaviours. However, mice showed a faster learning rate than humans. Moreover, both populations were clustered into good, intermediate and poor decision-making categories with similar proportions. Remarkably, mice characterised as good decision-makers behaved the same as humans of the same category, but slight differences among species are evident for the other two subpopulations. Overall, our direct comparative study confirms the good face validity of the rodent gambling task.

1081,Tessa S Schoot,"Lithium is the first line therapy of bipolar mood disorder. Lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Li-NDI) and lithium nephropathy (Li-NP, i.e., renal insufficiency) are prevalent side effects of lithium therapy, with significant morbidity. The objective of this systematic review is to provide an overview of preventive and management strategies for Li-NDI and Li-NP. For this, the PRISMA guideline for systematic reviews was used. Papers on the prevention and/or treatment of Li-NDI or Li-NP, and (influenceable) risk factors for development of Li-NDI or Li-NP were included. We found that the amount of evidence on prevention and treatment of Li-NDI and Li-NP is scarce. To prevent Li-NDI and Li-NP we advise to use a once-daily dosing schedule, target the lowest serum lithium level that is effective and prevent lithium intoxication. We emphasize the importance of monitoring for Li-NDI and Li-NP, as early diagnosis and treatment can prevent further progression and permanent damage. Collaboration between psychiatrist, nephrologist and patients themselves is essential. In patients with Li-NDI and/or Li-NP cessation of lithium therapy and/or switch to another mood stabilizer should be considered. In patients with Li-NDI, off label therapy with amiloride can be useful.",Thomas H J Molmans;Koen P Grootens;Angèle P M Kerckhoffs
1082,Damien Jullié,"A major function of GPCRs is to inhibit presynaptic neurotransmitter release, requiring ligand-activated receptors to couple locally to effectors at terminals. The current understanding of how this is achieved is through receptor immobilization on the terminal surface. Here, we show that opioid peptide receptors, GPCRs that mediate highly sensitive presynaptic inhibition, are instead dynamic in axons. Opioid receptors diffuse rapidly throughout the axon surface and internalize after ligand-induced activation specifically at presynaptic terminals. We delineate a parallel regulated endocytic cycle for GPCRs operating at the presynapse, separately from the synaptic vesicle cycle, which clears activated receptors from the surface of terminals and locally reinserts them to maintain the diffusible surface pool. We propose an alternate strategy for achieving local control of presynaptic effectors that, opposite to using receptor immobilization and enforced proximity, is based on lateral mobility of receptors and leverages the inherent allostery of GPCR-effector coupling.",Miriam Stoeber;Jean-Baptiste Sibarita;Hanna L Zieger;Thomas M Bartol;Seksiri Arttamangkul;Terrence J Sejnowski;Eric Hosy;Mark von Zastrow
1083,Alex Buoite Stella,"Hypohydration has been suggested increasing the risk of vascular diseases, and it is associated with poor prognosis and worse functional outcome in stroke. Most studies have used blood parameters to determine patients' hydration status. The aim of this study was to measure urine osmolality (uOsm) and its influence on stroke severity and independence. A prospective descriptive study was conducted in stroke patients admitted to a stroke unit. All patients underwent neurological evaluation at admission and discharge using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Independence at discharge was evaluated with the Barthel Index (BI) and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). uOsm was measured at admission. Patients were grouped in ""poor fluid intake"" (PF) and ""euhydration"" (EU), the latter if uOsm ≤ 500 mOsm/kg. Among 119 included patients, the prevalence of PF was 52%, with no difference observed between groups in demographics or blood samples analyses. PF had higher chances of NIHSS > 8 at admission (OR: 4.7 95% CI: 1.3-17.0; p = 0.02), lower BI at discharge (β: -15.3 95% CI: -26.7 to -3.8; p = 0.01), and worse mRS at discharge (OR: 4.01 95% CI: 1.2-14.0; p = 0.02).

1084,Mohammad Ali Salehinejad,"Despite growing interest in underlying cognitive mechanisms of self-esteem, its neurocognitive correlates are not fully-understood. Attention bias to self-related stimuli is an example of self-referential processing (SRP) and its association with self-esteem is not well-studied. Moreover, previous studies show that the medial prefrontal regions are involved in SRP which may suggest that it is involved in self-esteem too. We investigated the association between attention bias to self-related stimuli and its association with the level of self-esteem in the first study (N = 30). In the second study (N = 15), we modulated the activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), as a medial prefrontal region, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to see how it affects different domains of SE. Results show that individuals with a higher level of self-esteem are more attentionally biased to their own facial pictures (compared to other-facial pictures) and self-related words (compared to self-unrelated words) suggesting the potential impact of self-esteem on attentional and perceptual processes. Additionally, modulating activity of the VMPFC by 2 mA anodal and cathodal tDCS was associated with significantly higher ratings of global and total self-esteem but not other self-esteem domains. Our finding provides supporting evidence of neurocognitive correlates of self-esteem suggesting that it is associated with attentional bias toward ""self"" and might be a function of SRP at behavioural and neural levels.",Vahid Nejati;Michael A Nitsche
1085,Tsubasa Saeki,"The blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB) is a major structure that separates the inner ear from the systemic blood circulation. Many drugs cannot access the inner ear because of their inability to cross the BLB. In the cochlea, the BLB is mainly distributed in the lateral wall. However, the ultrastructure of the cochlear lateral wall, including the distribution of tight junctions (TJs), which are its main component, has not been thoroughly examined in primates. This study investigated the distribution of TJs in the cochlear lateral wall of the common marmoset by performing immunohistochemistry for TJ markers and transmission electron microscopy. As previously reported in rodents, TJs were distributed at the lumenal side of stria marginal cells and basal cells. In outer sulcus cells, which are more developed in primates than in rodents, TJs were distributed at the side with the endolymph but not at the side with the spiral ligament, where many capillaries were located. These findings indicate that drugs and small compounds circulating systemically in the blood can easily access outer sulcus cells, but have a limited ability to enter endolymph. No structural differences were detected between species, indicating that the in vivo distribution of drugs in cochlear lateral wall cells, including outer sulcus cells, in primates can be predicted by performing rodent experiments.",Makoto Hosoya;Shinsuke Shibata;Hideyuki Okano;Masato Fujioka;Kaoru Ogawa

1089,Ruth A Shaffer,"EndelTulving (1985) drew a distinction between Remembering and Knowing, spurring a great deal of research on the memorial experiences of recollection and familiarity and their contribution to various phenomena in memory. More recently, studies have used this distinction to situate our understanding of the processes that contribute to the testing effect-or, the benefit of retrieval practice to later memory (see also Tulving, 1967). Using retention intervals of approximately 15 min or less between initial and final testing, several studies have found that initial testing magnifies estimates of recollection but not familiarity, regardless of whether a testing effect is revealed in overall recognition performance (Chan and McDermott, 2007). However, the efficacy of prior testing in enhancing memory has been shown to change over time, as have estimates of recollection and familiarity. Thus, the mechanisms that underlie the quintessential testing effect-one that occurs in overall recognition or recall over longer delays-are still uncertain. To investigate this issue, in two experiments, subjects studied word lists, took 3-letter stem cued-recall tests on half of the studied words, and completed a final recognition test in which estimates of recollection and familiarity were obtained via confidence (Experiment 1) or Remember-Know-New (Experiment 2) judgments. Critically, final recognition tests occurred either immediately, 1 day (Experiment 1 only), or 4 days after initial learning. At all retention intervals and in both methods of estimating recollection and familiarity on the final test (i.e. receiver-operating characteristic and remember-know analyses), initial testing magnified estimates of both recollection and familiarity. These findings suggest that the testing effect can result from changes in both processes and pose issues for theories of the testing effect that consider an exclusive role for recollection.",Kathleen B McDermott
1090,Shanice E W Janssens,"As a highly social species, we constantly evaluate human faces to decide whether we can trust someone. Previous studies suggest that face trustworthiness can be processed unconsciously, but the underlying neural pathways remain unclear. Specifically, the question remains whether processing of face trustworthiness relies on early visual cortex (EVC), required for conscious perception. If processing of trustworthiness can bypass EVC, then disrupting EVC should impair subjective (conscious) trustworthiness perception while leaving objective (forced-choice) trustworthiness judgment intact. We applied double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to right EVC, at different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) from presentation of a face in either the left or right hemifield. Faces were slightly rotated clockwise or counterclockwise, and were either trustworthy or untrustworthy. On each trial, participants discriminated 1) trustworthiness, 2) stimulus rotation, and 3) reported subjective visibility of trustworthiness. At early SOAs and specifically in the left hemifield, performance on the rotation task was impaired by TMS. Crucially, though TMS also impaired subjective visibility of trustworthiness, no effects on trustworthiness discrimination were obtained. Thus, conscious perception of face trustworthiness (captured by subjective visibility ratings) relies on intact EVC, while objective forced-choice trustworthiness judgments may not. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that objective trustworthiness processing can bypass EVC. For basic visual features, extrastriate pathways are well-established; but face trustworthiness depends on a complex configuration of features. Its potential processing without EVC is therefore of particular interest, further highlighting its ecological relevance.",Alexander T Sack;Sarah Jessen;Tom A de Graaf
1091,Rocío A López Zunini,"In two experiments, we investigated the relationship between lexical access processes, and processes that are specifically related to making lexical decisions. In Experiment 1, participants performed a standard lexical decision task in which they had to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible to visual (written), auditory (spoken) and audiovisual (written + spoken) items. In Experiment 2, a different group of participants performed the same task but were required to make responses after a delay. Linear mixed effect models on reaction times and single trial Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) revealed that ERP lexicality effects started earlier in the visual than auditory modality, and that effects were driven by the written input in the audiovisual modality. More negative ERP amplitudes predicted slower reaction times in all modalities in both experiments. However, these predictive amplitudes were mainly observed within the window of the lexicality effect in Experiment 1 (the speeded task), and shifted to post-response-probe time windows in Experiment 2 (the delayed task). The lexicality effects lasted longer in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2, and in the delayed task, we additionally observed a ""re-instantiation"" of the lexicality effect related to the delayed response. Delaying the response in an otherwise identical lexical decision task thus allowed us to separate lexical access processes from processes specific to lexical decision.",Martijn Baart;Arthur G Samuel;Blair C Armstrong
1092,Daniel Smieja,"Despite early bilateral cochlear implantation, children with congenital deafness do not develop accurate spatial hearing; we thus asked whether auditory brain networks are disrupted in these children. EEG responses were evoked unilaterally and bilaterally in 13 children with normal hearing and 16 children receiving bilateral cochlear implants simultaneously. Active cortical areas were estimated by the Time Restricted Artifact and Coherent source Suppression (TRACS) beamformer and connected cortical areas were identified by measuring coherence between source responses. A whole-brain analysis of theta band coherence revealed the strongest connections between the temporal areas in all conditions at early latencies. Stronger imaginary coherence in activity between the two auditory cortices to bilateral than unilateral input was found in children with normal hearing reflecting facilitation in the auditory network during bilateral hearing. The opposite effect, depressed coherence, was found during bilateral stimulation in children using cochlear implants. Children with cochlear implants also showed a unique auditory network in response to bilateral stimulation which was marked by increased connectivity between occipital and frontal areas. These findings suggest that cortical networks for sound processing are normally facilitated by bilateral input but are disrupted in children who hear through two independent cochlear implants. Efforts to improve hearing in children with congenital deafness must thus include corrections to potential mismatches in bilateral input to support brain development.",Benjamin T Dunkley;Blake C Papsin;Vijayalakshmi Easwar;Hiroshi Yamazaki;Michael Deighton;Karen A Gordon
1093,Patrick D Skelton,"Pten, a gene associated with autism spectrum disorder, is an upstream regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase intracellular signaling pathways that mediate extracellular cues to inform cellular development and activity-dependent plasticity. We therefore hypothesized that Pten loss would interfere with activity dependent dendritic growth. We investigated the effects of this interaction on the maturation of retrovirally labeled postnatally generated wild-type and Pten knockout granule neurons in male and female mouse dentate gyrus while using chemogenetics to manipulate the activity of the perforant path afferents. We find that enhancing network activity accelerates the dendritic outgrowth of wild-type, but not Pten knockout, neurons. This was specific to immature neurons during an early developmental window. We also examined synaptic connectivity and physiological measures of neuron maturation. The input resistance, membrane capacitance, dendritic spine morphology, and frequency of spontaneous synaptic events were not differentially altered by activity in wild-type versus Pten knockout neurons. Therefore, Pten and its downstream signaling pathways regulate the activity-dependent sculpting of the dendritic arbor during neuronal maturation.",Jessie Poquerusse;Julia R Salinaro;Meijie Li;Bryan W Luikart
1094,Fang-Yu Lin,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) starts with memory impairments that can be observed before the appearance of significant neuropathology; thus, identifying mechanisms to stop AD progression is an urgent priority. Epidemiological and clinical data show that the consequences of vitamin D deficiency are relevant to disease risk and can be observed in the progression of many diseases, especially AD, whereas higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with better cognitive test performance. However, the potential therapeutic strategy and underlying mechanisms of vitamin D supplementation against AD still need to be further investigated. In the present study, we found that 3xTg-AD mice with vitamin D supplementation exhibited an increase in serum vitamin D concentrations and improved cognition. We measured serum vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) concentrations and found that serum VDBP levels were increased in 3xTg-AD mice compared to B6129S control mice, but there was no significant difference between control- and vitamin D-treated 3xTg-AD groups. The vitamin D-mediated memory improvement may be accompanied by the suppression of increased hippocampal collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) phosphorylation, and the restoration of CRMP2 phosphorylation by okadaic acid (OA) could abolish the beneficial effects of vitamin D. In addition, we found that CRMP2 was associated with NR2B and PSD-95 in 3xTg-AD mice with vitamin D supplementation. This CRMP2-NR2B interaction could be disrupted by a TAT-CBD3 peptide or OA, leading to attenuated memory protection in vitamin D-treated 3xTg-AD mice. Therefore, CRMP2 may be involved in vitamin D-mediated memory improvement in AD.",Yu-Fen Lin;Yung-Shuen Lin;Chun-Ming Yang;Che-Chuan Wang;Ya-Hsin Hsiao
1095,Asma Oummadi,"BACKGROUND
There is clear evidence that most of the paradigms that are used in the field of behavioral neuroscience suffer from a lack of reliability mainly because of oversimplification of both testing procedures and interpretations. In the present study we show how an already existing behavioral test, the olfactory habituation / dishabituation task, can be optimized in such a way that animal number and animal distress could be minimized, number/confidence of behavioral outcomes and number of explored behavioral dimensions could be increased.


NEW METHOD
We used ethologically relevant technical and procedural changes associated with videotracking-based automated quantification of sniffing behavior to validate our new setup. Mainly internal and construct validity were challenged through the implementation of a series of simple experiments.


RESULTS
We show that the new version of the test: 1) has very good within and inter laboratory replicability, 2) is sensitive to some environmental / experimental factors while insensitive to others, 3) allows investigating hedonism, both state and trait anxiety, efficacy of anxiolytic molecules, acute stress, mental retardation-related social impairments and learning and memory. 4) We also show that interest for both nonsocial and social odors is stable over time which makes repetitive testing possible.


CONCLUSIONS
This work paves the way for future studies showing how behavioral tests / procedures may be improved by using ethologically relevant changes, in order to question laboratory animals more adequately. Refining behavioral tests may considerably increase predictivity of preclinical tests and, ultimately, help reinforcing translational research.",Géraldine Meyer-Dilhet;Béry Amandine;Aubert Arnaud;Pascal Barone;Stéphane Mortaud;Gilles J Guillemin;Arnaud Menuet;Anthony Laugeray
1096,Parisa Forouzannezhad,"BACKGROUND
Diagnosis of early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its delineation from the cognitively normal (CN), remains a challenging but essential step for the planning of early treatment. Although several studies have focused on the MCI diagnosis, this study introduces the early stage of MCI to assess more thoroughly the earliest signs of disease manifestation and progression.


NEW METHOD
We used random forest feature selection model with a Gaussian-based algorithm to perform method evaluation. This integrated method serves to define multivariate normal distributions in order to classify different stages of AD, with the focus placed on detecting EMCI subjects in the most challenging classification of CN vs. EMCI.


RESULTS
Using 896 participants classified into the four categories of CN, EMCI, LMCI and AD, the results show that the EMCI group can be delineated from the CN group with a relatively high accuracy of 78.8% and sensitivity of 81.3%.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S)
The feature selection model and classifier, are compared with some other algorithms. Although higher accuracy has been achieved using the GP model (78.8%) over the SVM classifier (75.6%) for CN vs. EMCI classification, with 0.05 being the cutoff for significance, and based on student's t-test, it was determined that the differences for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity between the GP method and SVM are not statistically significant.


CONCLUSION
Addressing the challenging classification of CN vs. EMCI provides useful information to help clinicians and researchers determine essential measures that can help in the early detection of AD.",Alireza Abbaspour;Chunfei Li;Chen Fang;Ulyana Williams;Mercedes Cabrerizo;Armando Barreto;Jean Andrian;Naphtali Rishe;Rosie E Curiel;David Loewenstein;Ranjan Duara;Malek Adjouadi
1097,Krishnashis Chatterjee,"The brain consists of a complex network of cells and matrix that is kept cushioned and nourished by multiple types of fluids: cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and interstitial fluid. The movement of these fluids through the tissues has recently gained more attention due to implications in Alzheimer's Disease and glioblastoma. Therefore, methods to study these fluid flows are necessary and timely for the current study of neuroscience. Imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging have been used clinically and pre-clinically to image flows in healthy and diseased brains. These measurements have been used to both parameterize and validate models of fluid flow both computational and in vitro. Both of these models can elucidate the changes to fluid flow that occur during disease and can assist in linking the compartments of fluid flow with one another, a difficult challenge experimentally. In vitro models, though in limited use with fluid flow, allow the examination of cellular responses to physiological flow. To determine causation, in vivo methods have been developed to manipulate flow, including both physical and pharmacological manipulations, at each point of fluid movement of origination resulting in exciting findings in the preclinical setting. With new targets, such as the brain-draining lymphatics and glymphatic system, fluid flow and tissue drainage within the brain is an exciting and growing research area. In this review, we discuss the methods that currently exist to examine and test hypotheses related to fluid flow in the brain as we attempt to determine its impact on neural function.",Cora M Esparza;Jennifer M Munson
1098,Naomi Tistarelli,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children worldwide, and also the recognition of its persistence into adulthood is increasing. While ADHD in childhood is highly heritable and mostly driven by familial factors, during adulthood it appears to show a lower heritability, even if there is not total agreement on this yet. This disorder often co-occurs with many other conditions, which also vary across the different stages of development, and several studies have used the twin design to investigate these comorbidities, giving valuable insights into the origins of the observed co-occurrence. This review aims to summarize the main results of twin research, according to the following domains: individual traits, cognitive impairment, behavioral manifestations, clinical conditions and psychosocial risk factors. Individual features seem to play a role in this symptomatology and include personality traits such as negative emotionality, personality disorders and temperamental dimensions with a predominance of novelty seeking. At a lower level, ADHD is associated with both functional and anatomic brain characteristics. ADHD is also associated with some forms of cognitive impairment, such as sluggish cognitive tempo, and learning disabilities, with a specific predisposition to reading disability. In addition, ADHD is strongly associated with externalizing disorders such as conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, and some behavioral outcomes, particularly substance use and abuse both in adolescence and adulthood. Moreover, ADHD symptoms often overlap with other psychological disorders, namely affective and internalizing disorders, as well as autism spectrum disorder and autistic-like traits in a wider sense. Notably, a genetic overlap has been found between asthma and ADHD, particularly with respect to hyperactivity/impulsivity dimensions. ADHD also appears to represent a risk factor for disordered eating, and, more specifically, for binge eating and bulimia nervosa. Finally, among psychosocial factors, an association has been proposed between childhood maltreatment and ADHD symptoms.",Corrado Fagnani;Miriam Troianiello;Maria Antonietta Stazi;Walter Adriani
1099,Simone Sulpizio,"Notwithstanding rising interest, a coherent picture of the brain's representation of two languages has not yet been achieved. In the present meta-analysis we analysed a large number of functional neuroimaging studies focusing on language processing in bilinguals. We used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to enucleate activation areas involved in bilingual processing and control of different types of linguistic knowledge - lexico-semantics, grammar, phonology - in L1 and L2. Results show that surprisingly, compared to L2, lexico-semantic processing in L1 involves a widespread system of cortico-subcortical regions, especially when L2 is acquired later in life. By contrast, L2 processing recruits regions exceeding the L1 semantic network and relating to executive control processes. Only few regions displayed selective activation for grammar and phonology. Analyses of language switching highlight a functional overlap between domain-general and bilingual language control networks. Collectively, our findings point to a shared neural network for L1 and L2 with few differences depending on the linguistic level. The emerging picture identifies under-investigated issues, offering clear directions for future research.",Nicola Del Maschio;Davide Fedeli;Jubin Abutalebi
1100,Negin Badihian,"Gestational period plays critical role in neuropsychological development. One of the genes that undergoes changes by prenatal stress (PNS) exposure, is the gene coding brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Studies have reported different patterns of change following PNS in BDNF, which emphasizes the complexity of the issue. In this review, systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL databases was performed. Primary searches resulted in 2132 studies and finally 43 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Transcriptional and epigenetic changes of BDNF gene in the brain were recorded. Decreased or unchanged BDNF total mRNA and BDNF mature protein, with hypermethylation of the coding exons were the most reported changes. However, stress paradigm, gender of the fetus and the day of sacrifice were found to significantly affect the results. Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are the most vulnerable regions. They can show long lasting and persistent transcriptional and epigenetics changes of BDNF gene following PNS. Further studies evaluating the importance of these findings in humans are essential.",Seyede Shahrbanoo Daniali;Roya Kelishadi

This meta-analysis provides a quantitative review and reappraisal of MRS findings in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) and Friedreich ataxia (FA) available to date. From each study, changes in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (Cho) and myo-Inositol (mI) ratios to total creatine (Cr) were calculated for groups of patients (1499 patients in total: SCA1 = 223, SCA2 = 298, SCA3 = 711, SCA6 = 165, and FA = 102) relative to their own control group, mostly in cerebellum and pons. SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and FA patients showed overall decreased NAA/Cr compared to controls. Decreased Cho/Cr was visible in SCA1, 2, and 3 and elevated mI/Cr in SCA2 patients in cerebellum. In SCA6 and FA Cho/Cr and mI/Cr did not differ with respect to controls but SCA6 patients indicated higher Cho/Cr compared to SCA1 patients in cerebellum. SCA2 subjects showed the lowest NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr in cerebellum and the highest mI/Cr compared to controls and other genotypes, and therefore the most promising results for a potential biomarker.",Ferdinand Binkofski;Jörg B Schulz;Kathrin Reetz;Sandro Romanzetti
1102,Van T Nguyen,"BACKGROUND
This study investigated the effects of early moderate prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) on the brain in a mouse model that mimics a scenario in humans, whereby moderate daily drinking ceases after a woman becomes aware of her pregnancy.


METHODS
C57BL/6 J pregnant mice were given 10% v/v ethanol from gestational day 0-8 in the drinking water. The male offspring were used for imaging. Anatomical and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging were performed in vivo at postnatal day 28 (P28, adolescence) and P80 (adulthood). Micro-Computed Tomography was performed on fixed whole heads at P80. Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) was applied to detect alterations in brain structure and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for skull morphology. Diffusion tensor and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging models were used to detect microstructural changes. Neurofilament (NF) immunohistochemistry was used to validate findings by in vivo diffusion MRI.


RESULTS
TBM showed that PEE mice exhibited a significantly smaller third ventricle at P28 (family-wise error rate (FWE), p < .05). All other macro-structural alterations did not survive FWE corrections but when displayed with an uncorrected p < .005 showed multiple regional volume reductions and expansions, more prominently in the right hemisphere. PEE-induced gross volume changes included a bigger thalamus, hypothalamus and ventricles at P28, and bigger total brain volumes at both P28 and P80 (2-sample t-tests, uncorrected for multiple comparison). Disproportionately smaller olfactory bulbs following PEE were revealed at both time-points. No alterations in diffusion parameters were detected, but PEE animals exhibited reduced NF positive staining in the thalamus and striatum and greater bone density in various skull regions.


CONCLUSION
Our results show that early moderate PEE can cause alterations in the brain that are detectable during development and adulthood.",Quang M Tieng;Karine Mardon;Christine Zhang;Suyinn Chong;Graham J Galloway;Nyoman D Kurniawan
1103,Zahra Fatahi,"Several studies indicated that morphine administration impairs cognitive brain functions. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the effect of subchronic exposure to morphine and its withdrawal on effort- and/or delay-based forms of cost-benefit decision making and alterations in p-CREB/CREB ratio, p-GSK3β/GSK3β ratio, and BDNF level during decision making in the amygdala. Our data displayed an impairment of both forms of cost-benefit decision making following subchronic exposure to morphine. However, preference of high reward/high effort and/or high delay reward increased after naloxone injection. In molecular section, levels of BDNF and p-CREB/CREB ratio increased during cost-benefit decision making while p-GSK3β/GSK3β ratio decreased in both forms of decision making. In morphine-treated rats, level of BDNF and p-CREB/CREB ratio reduced during both forms of decision making while p-GSK3β/ GSK3β ratio increased during delay-based and did not have a significant difference with the control group during effort-based decision making. On the withdrawal day, BDNF level raised while p-GSK3β/GSK3β ratio attenuated compared to morphine-treated group in both form of decision making. In addition, p-CREB/CREB ratio increased only during delay-based decision making on the withdrawal day. In conclusion, our data revealed that subchronic exposure to morphine interferes with the cost-benefit decision making may be via changes in level of BDNF, p-CREB/CREB and p-GSK3β/ GSK3β ratio in the amygdala.",Arman Zeinaddini-Meymand;Saeideh Karimi-Haghighi;Marzieh Moradi;Fariba Khodagholi;Abbas Haghparast
1104,J Lipp,"An extended neural network is known to underlie extinction learning. As yet, comparatively little is known about the possible contribution of the cerebellum and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). In the present study, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used to provide further evidence that the dlPFC and the cerebellum are involved in extinction-related processes. A total of 100 young and healthy human participants were randomly assigned to one of five stimulation groups: 1) anodal tDCS of the cerebellum, 2) cathodal tDCS of the cerebellum, 3) anodal tDCS of the dlPFC, 4) cathodal tDCS of the dlPFC, and 5) sham stimulation. Participants underwent delay eyeblink conditioning using an A-B-A/B renewal paradigm. Two different colors of background light (orange and blue) were used as contexts. On day 1, acquisition of conditioned eyeblink responses was performed in context A, followed by extinction in context B. tDCS was applied during extinction. On day 2, extinction recall was tested in contexts A and B with higher incidence of conditioned responses in acquisition context A compared to extinction context B indicating renewal effects. All groups showed significant effects of acquisition of conditioned eyeblink responses and significant effects of extinction. There was no significant difference in extinction between stimulation groups. During extinction recall, renewal effects were present in all groups, except the group which had received anodal tDCS of the dlPFC during extinction. In the present study, no direct effects of dlPFC or cerebellar tDCS were demonstrated on extinction. Anodal tDCS of the dlPFC, but not the cerebellum, resulted in delayed effects on context-related processes of extinction, possibly explained by shifting attention away from the context and towards the conditioned stimulus during extinction learning. Anodal tDCS of the dlPFC attenuated context-related recall of learned aversive responses. Effects of tDCS, however, were weak and need to be confirmed in future studies. Lack of cerebellar tDCS effects do not exclude a possible role of the cerebellum in extinction-related processes, and are likely explained by methodological limitations of cerebellar tDCS.",R Draganova;G Batsikadze;T M Ernst;M Uengoer;D Timmann
1105,William Clifton,"Iatrogenic lumbar arachnoid cysts are a rare occurrence after intradural surgery1,2. To our knowledge, there is only one other previous case reported in the literature contributing to a symptomatic tethered cord3. We present a surgical video demonstrating the history, preoperative workup, and operative technique for exploration and fenestration of a symptomatic iatrogenic lumbar arachnoid cyst with tethered cord. The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of a closed neural tube defect with a lipoma that was resected over 20 years prior to her evaluation. She was lost to follow-up, and did not retain any previous medical documentation. She complained of a two-month history of progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness, leg pain, and acute on chronic urinary incontinence. Imaging demonstrated a cystic lesion compressing her conus and cauda equina at the L3-4 level. The risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed, and the patient elected to proceed with surgery. Intraoperative findings demonstrated a complex multi-loculated arachnoid cyst with tethering of her conus. The cysts were dissected from her conus and fenestrated, allowing spontaneous flow of CSF and conus pulsations. Biopsy of the cyst wall confirmed the diagnosis of arachnoid cyst without neoplastic tissue. Due to the presence of multiple loculations, a primary pial closure was not able to be performed. Thus, a circumferential de-tethering of the conus was employed to ensure complete decompression of the neural elements. Postoperatively, the patient demonstrated improvement in her bilateral lower extremity pain and weakness.

1107,Munibe Busra Erdem,"Trochlear schwannoma in the absence of neurofibromatosis is a rare entity.1 They originate usually from the intradural cisternal part of the nerve and expand in the ambient and interpeduncular cisterns, as well as inferiorly in the upper part of the cerebellopontine cistern.2 This case presents a rare pontomesencephalic lesion removed successfully via the simple retrosigmoid suboccipital route. A 49-year-old female patient presented at our institute with a complaint of decreased sensation on the left side of her body for two months. Neurological examination revealed left hemi-hypesthesia. The cranial MRI revealed a lobulated heterogeneously enhanced cystic tumor within the right ambient cistern compressing the adjacent midbrain and extending to the cerebellopontine angle. After obtaining consent for surgery, the patient was operated with right suboccipital retrosigmoid approach for exploration and resection of the lesion. In the surgery, it was determined that the tumor originated from the trochlear nerve. The nerve-sparing surgery was performed with intraoperative neuromonitorization including cranial nerve V, VII, X, XI, and XII electromyographs and muscle motor evoked potentials. Gross total resection of the tumor was achieved. In the early postoperative period, the eye movements were normal in all directions. The patient did not have any vision complains and experienced improvement in hemi-hypesthesia. She was discharged on the third postoperative day. Pathological examination confirmed diagnosis of schwannoma. After two months from surgery, the patient's eye movements were intact and trochlear nerve palsy did not occur.

1108,Joel Simrén,"Over the last twenty years, the characterization of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients has progressed from a description of clinical symptomatology followed by neuropathological findings at autopsy to in vivo pathophysiological signatures using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET). Additionally, CSF biomarkers now reflect synaptic pathology, axonal injury and neuroinflammation. Novel techniques are capable of measuring proteins of pathophysiological importance at femtomolar concentrations in blood (e.g. amyloid, tau species and neurofilaments), which enable screening of large populations in the near future. This will be essential for secondary prevention trials and clinical management. However, common diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementias, are still without reliable diagnostic biomarkers, although emerging techniques show promising pilot results for some of these diseases. This is likely to change in the next few years, which will be crucial to stratify populations enrolling in clinical trials, since pathologies often coexist.",Nicholas J Ashton;Kaj Blennow;Henrik Zetterberg
1109,Kankan Zong,"Neuroinflammation is an important pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases, and microglial contributes to chronic inflammation and neuronal loss in progressive neurodegenerative. Therefore, regulating the inflammatory response of microglia could lead to the discovery of promising treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of the nutmeg plant seed extract, macelignan, on the inflammatory response of microglia and neuronal cell survival. We detected NO and iNOS using the Griess test and Western blotting. We measured phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt expression by Western blotting. The release of NO and inflammatory cytokines and the expression of iNOS decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, with an increase in macelignan concentration. PI3K/Akt phosphorylation levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglial cells after exposure to macelignan. We also demonstrated that macelignan improved HT22 cell viability, following exposure to a microglial-conditioned medium. Furthermore, macelignan inhibited microglial cell near neurons treated with a hypoxic conditioned medium. Finally, macelignan treatment reduced the expression of p27 and cyclin D1 in neurons cultured in an LPS-activated microglia-conditioned medium. Therefore, these results imply that macelignan can inhibit the inflammatory response of microglia and regulate neuronal survival through the PI3K/Akt pathway.",Xin Liu;Zhou Sun;Lihua Piao;Yanhua Xuan;Yu Jin;Chun-Ai Cui

Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital malformations, and right-sided dominance of the language cortex is not a rare phenomenon for patients with AVM involving language area. We tried to use voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) method to depict the location of AVM nidus and to demonstrate the relationship between AVM location and the pattern of language cortex reorganization.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
The authors retrospectively reviewed clinical and imaging data of 70 adult patients with unruptured cerebral AVMs who underwent blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of language task. All patients were right handed, and all lesions were located in the left cerebral hemisphere. Lateralization indexes (LI) of the BOLD signals were calculated for Broca and Wernicke areas separately and were used to reflect the degree of right-sided dominance of the two language areas. VLSM method was applied to study the relationship between AVM location and LI of language task activations.


RESULTS
Statistical analysis revealed that the change of LI of Broca area was significantly associated with lesions located in the inferior frontal gyrus, pre- and post-central gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. The change of LI of Wernicke area was significantly associated with lesions located in the left superior, middle, inferior and transverse temporal gyrus.

1111,Shuai Zhang,"OBJECTIVE
The height and width of the iliac wing were measured using three-dimensional computed tomography(3D-CT), and the extent to which the iliac wing occluded the entry point of the 5th lumbar vertebra pedicle screw(L5PS) was observed and graded according to severity. The overall goal was to study the influence of the height and width of the iliac wing on L5PS insertion.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
This study included 350 cases (179 males and 171 females) where the L1-S2 region was obtained. We reconstructed 3D-CT in our study for anatomic analysis. The width and height of the iliac wing were measured on CT axial and oblique sagittal images, respectively. The degree of the L5PS entry point was determined by the data of iliac wing width and height, and divided into 0, I, II and III levels. The association between width and height of the iliac wing among males and females was also analyzed in this paper.


RESULTS
The incidence of shielding of the L5PS entry point by the height and width of the ilium wing were 20.0 % and 19.4 %, respectively. The overall incidence of obstruction of L5PS by the width of the ilium wing was 27.3 % in males and 12.3 % in females. In total, there were 27, 14, and 8 male patients with level I, II, and III shielding, respectively. There were 12, 7, and 2 females with level I, II, and III shielding, respectively. The overall incidence with which the height of the ilium wing obstructed L5PS was 24.0 % in males and 14.6 % in females, of which there were 23 males with level Ⅰ shielding, 16 males with level Ⅱ shielding, 4 males with level Ⅲ shielding, 13 females with level Ⅰ shielding, 8 females with level Ⅱ shielding, and 4 females with level Ⅲ shielding.


CONCLUSIONS
The height of the ilium caused obstruction of the L5PS more frequently than the width of the ilium, and males had a higher incidence of iliac wing occlusion than females at both the height and width. The degree of L5PS entry point shielding by the iliac wing width along the horizontal axis was not completely consistent with that of L5PS shielding on the oblique sagittal plane.",JianYuan Ouyang;XueLian Peng;Song Wang;Qing Wang
1112,Nahla O Mousa,"OBJECTIVE
The diagnosis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) currently depends on non-specific measures such as Creatine kinase (CK) levels. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, endogenous RNAs of 21-25 nucleotides, that are important regulators for numerous physiological and pathological processes. The aim of the current study is to assess the potential of miRNAs as non-invasive biomarker for the diagnosis of DMD and for identifying carriers.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Thirty healthy subjects and 29 families with one member diagnosed with DMD were enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all subjects where microRNAs were extracted from plasma followed by the quantification of miR-499, miR-103a-3p, miR-103a-5p, miR-206, miR-208a, miR-223 and miR-191-5p. MLPA and NGS were carried out as a gold standard technique to identify the mutations in the participants.


RESULTS
Our data revealed that miR-499 was significantly upregulated in all DMD patients, and true carriers (mothers), while 78 % of potential carriers (sisters) exhibited high levels of this miRNA. Similarly, miR-103a-3p showed an increase in the patients' families although to a lesser extent. On the other hand, miR-206 and miR-191-5p were significantly downregulated in the majority of the DMD patients and the tested female family members. MicroRNA miR-103a-5p and miR-208a followed a comparable trend in patients and mothers.


CONCLUSIONS
Ourresults suggest that the plasma levels of miRNAs have the capability to diagnose DMD patients and more importantly, miRNAs can be used to identify female carriers.",Ahmed Abdellatif;Nagia Fahmy;Suher Zada;Hassan El-Fawal;Ahmed Osman

Inner ear structures may be included in the radiation fields when irradiation is used to treat patients with head and neck cancers. These patients may also have concurrent infections that require gentamicin treatment. Radiation and gentamicin are both potentially ototoxic, and their combined use has been shown to result in synergistic ototoxicity in animals.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to confirm the synergistic ototoxicity of combined gentamicin and low-dose irradiation treatment and identify the underlying molecular mechanisms using an in vitro model.


METHOD
We compared the ototoxic effects of gentamicin, low-dose irradiation, and their combination in the OC-k3 mouse cochlear cell line using cell viability assay, live/dead stain, apoptosis detection assay, oxidative stress detection, and studied the molecular mechanisms involved using immunoblot analysis.


RESULTS
Combined treatment led to prolonged oxidative stress, reduced cell viability, and synergistic apoptosis. Gentamicin induced the concurrent accumulation of LC3b-II and SQSTM1/p62, suggesting an impairment of autophagic flux. Low-dose irradiation induced transient p53 phosphorylation and persistent Akt phosphorylation in response to DNA damage. In combined treatment, gentamicin attenuated irradiation-induced Akt activation.


CONCLUSIONS
Besides increased oxidative stress, synergistic apoptosis observed in combined treatment could be attributed to gentamicin-induced perturbation of autophagic flux and attenuation of Akt phosphorylation, which led to an impairment of radiation-induced DNA repair response.",Siaw Wei Teng;Michelle G K Tan

Lateral meningocele syndrome (LMS) is an exceedingly rare connective tissue disease with phenotypic anomalies similar to those seen in Marfan syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. However, this syndrome is invariably associated with the presence of multiple lateral thoracolumbar spinal meningoceles: a distinct point of phenotypic divergence from other connective tissue disorders. The etiopathogenesis of this syndrome has recently been linked to truncating mutations within exon 33 of NOTCH3. Despite numerous reports, neurosurgical management of multiple spinal meningoceles remains poorly defined in the literature. We conducted a literature review to provide insight into the nosology, clinical significance, and neurosurgical management strategies of this distinct connective tissue disorder.


SUMMARY
Our literature search revealed 11 articles (16 cases) of LMS, which included 9 males and 7 females, belonging to 14 different families. Half of these cases underwent genetic screening: all of which were discovered to exhibit a truncating mutation within exon 33 of NOTCH3. All patients exhibited multiple lateral thoracolumbar spinal meningoceles with craniofacial dysmorphisms. Other clinical characteristics included pathologic changes in spine morphology, Chiari I malformation, syringomyelia, hydrocephalus, and tethered cord. Operative management of multiple spinal meningoceles in LMS is complicated by the presence of such coexisting structural neurologic pathologies, which may alter cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics and, ultimately, impact operative intervention. Key Messages: LMS is an exceedingly rare connective tissue disorder with severe spinal dural involvement. Neurosurgical management of multiple spinal meningoceles is complex, which is further complicated by the presence of coexisting neuropathology, such as pathologic transformation of spine morphology and Chiari I malformation. Patients with a connective tissue disorder phenotype found to have multiple spinal meningoceles on imaging studies may benefit from evaluation by a medical geneticist and a pediatric neurosurgeon.",Brendan J Klein;Christopher M Busch;Hailey L Gosnell;Ayesha Kar;Eric A Marvin;Lisa S Apfel
1115,Kunal Vakharia,"Several studies have shown the efficacy and feasibility of flow diversion for the endovascular treatment of wide-necked and otherwise anatomically challenging intracranial aneurysms (IA).

With growing indications for use of the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED, Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) to include IAs up to the internal carotid artery (ICA) terminus, understanding the nuances of this technology is increasingly relevant. Furthermore, there is a growing body of literature on the use of flow diversion to treat distal (up to A2, M2, and P2), ruptured, and posterior circulation aneurysms, although these applications are ""off-label"" at present.

1117,Peter Kan,"BACKGROUND
The safety and efficacy of flow diversion (FD) in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms have been reported by many studies. FD has enabled the treatment of complex aneurysms and aneurysms that were previously untreatable by conventional means. It has achieved high rates of obliteration with essentially no recanalization, and its indications have continued to expand, now including ruptured aneurysms, blister aneurysms, and dissecting aneurysms.


OBJECTIVE
To provide a review on the outcomes of studies covering the use of FD in the settings of ruptured, blister, and dissecting aneurysms. In addition, to discuss dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) used in preparation for FD deployment in these scenarios, including associated complications with DAPT use in the acute rupture setting.


METHODS
References for this topical review were identified by PubMed searches between January 2000 and January 2019. The search terms ""aneurysm"", ""flow diverter"", ""stent"", ""pipeline"", ""ruptured"", ""blister"", and ""dissecting aneurysms"" were used.


RESULTS
FD carries a higher complication rate in the acute rupture setting than for unruptured aneurysms. Patient selection is of paramount importance for achieving good functional and angiographic outcomes. DAPT still remains challenging, especially in ruptured aneurysms. Advancements in surface modification of flow diverters can reduce the risk of thromboembolism and perhaps lead to a safer antiplatelet regimen.

1119,Albert Ho Yuen Chiu,"The treatment of intracranial aneurysms has undergone a few very significant paradigm shifts in its history. Needless to say, microsurgery and surgical clipping served as the initial basis for successful treatment of these lesions. The pursuit of endovascular therapy subsequently arose from the desire to reduce the invasiveness of therapy. While the first breakthrough arose with Guido Guglielmi's invention of the detachable platinum coil, commercialized flow diverter therapy represents a disruptive therapy with a completely different paradigm for aneurysmal obliteration. This has not only altered the distribution of aneurysmal management strategies, but also opened the gateway to the treatment of previously inoperable lesions. With the basic flow diverter stent technology now considered an integral part of the neurointerventional armamentarium, we now consider what may lay in the future - including potential directions for research with regards to case selection; the location and type of aneurysms which may become routinely treatable; and modifications to the flow diverter, which may increase its utility and safety in terms of size, structural design, and surface modifications.",Timothy John Phillips

Since 2011 when the PipelineTM Embolization Device (Medtronic) was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for adults with large or giant wide-neck intracranial aneurysms of the internal carotid artery proximal to the posterior communicating segment, the role of flow diversion for aneurysm treatment has expanded-supported by favorably low complication and high cure rates compared with alternative treatments.

1122,Anna Luisa Kühn,"The introduction of flow diverter technology to the field of neurointervention has revolutionized the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The therapy approach has shifted from intrasaccular aneurysm treatment to exclusion of the aneurysm from the blood circulation with remodeling of the parent artery. Previously, ""difficult""-to-treat aneurysms including fusiform and blister aneurysms, but also aneurysms arising from a diseased vessel segment, can now be safely and permanently treated with flow diverters.  A little over a decade ago, after extensive bench testing and refinement of the flow diverter concept, the device was eventually available for clinical use and today it has become a standard treatment for intracranial aneurysms. Currently, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved flow diverters are the Pipeline Embolization Device (Medtronic) and the Surpass Streamline Flow Diverter (Stryker).  The devices can either be delivered or deployed via a standard femoral artery approach or a radial artery approach. Other considerations for catheter setup and device deployment strategies depending on aneurysm location or vessel anatomy are described.",Matthew J Gounis;Ajit S Puri
1123,Nimer Adeeb,"Posterior circulation aneurysms are often associated with a higher risk of rupture and compressive symptoms compared to their anterior circulation counterpart. Due to high morbidity and mortality associated with microsurgical treatment of those aneurysms, endovascular therapy gained ascendance as the preferred method of treatment. Flow diversion has emerged as a promising treatment option for posterior circulation aneurysms with a higher occlusion rate compared to other endovascular techniques and a lower complication rate compared to microsurgery. While treatment of saccular and dissecting aneurysms is often associated with comparatively good outcomes, fusiform and dolichoectatic aneurysms should be carefully selected prior to treatment to avoid devastating thromboembolic complications. Occlusion of covered posterior circulation branches showed no correlation with ischemic complications, and appropriate antiplatelet regimen and switching Clopidogrel nonresponders to different antiplatelet agents were associated with lower complication rates following flow diversion of posterior circulation aneurysms.",Christopher S Ogilvy;Christoph J Griessenauer;Ajith J Thomas
1124,Georgios A Maragkos,"Over the past decade, flow diverter technology for endocranial aneurysms has seen rapid evolution, with the development of new devices quickly outpacing the clinical evidence base. However, flow diversion has not yet been directly compared to surgical aneurysm clipping or other endovascular procedures. The oldest and most well-studied device is the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED; Medtronic), recently transitioned to the Pipeline Flex (Medtronic), which still has sparse data regarding outcomes. To date, other flow diverting devices have not been shown to outperform the PED, although information comes primarily from retrospective studies with short follow-up, which are not always comparable. Because of this lack of high-quality outcome data, no reliable recommendations can be made for choosing among flow diversion devices yet. Moreover, the decision to proceed with flow diversion should be individualized to each patient. In this work, we wish to provide a comprehensive overview of the technical specifications of all flow diverter devices currently available, accompanied by a succinct description of the evidence base surrounding each device.",Adam A Dmytriw;Mohamed M Salem;Vincent M Tutino;Hui Meng;Christophe Cognard;Paolo Machi;Timo Krings;Vitor Mendes Pereira
1125,Daniel A Tonetti,"Dual antiplatelet therapy is typically employed as a means to mitigate thromboembolic complications after deployment of flow diverters, most commonly consisting of aspirin with either clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor. Recent studies have demonstrated at least similar efficacy for ticagrelor as compared to clopidogrel in the form of periprocedural complications and angiographic results. Though controversial, systematic reviews of platelet function assay usage have demonstrated greater rates of thrombotic complications in antiplatelet hyporesponders and greater rates of hemorrhagic complications in hyperresponders. Though in its infancy, the management of antiplatelet therapy for acutely ruptured aneurysms treated with flow diversion is not yet standardized, with approaches including intravenous glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors and subsequent antiplatelet loading vs antiplatelet loading, response assessment, and subsequent treatment.",Brian T Jankowitz;Bradley A Gross

Distal junctional kyphosis (DJK) development after cervical deformity (CD)-corrective surgery is a growing concern for surgeons and patients. Few studies have investigated risk factors that predict the occurrence of DJK.


OBJECTIVE
To predict DJK development after CD surgery using predictive modeling.


METHODS
CD criteria was at least one of the following: C2-C7 Coronal/Cobb > 10°, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (cSVA) > 4 cm, chin-brow vertical angle > 25°. DJK was defined as the development of an angle <-10° from the end of fusion construct to the second distal vertebra, and change in this angle by <-10° from baseline to postoperative. Baseline demographic, clinical, and surgical information were used to predict the occurrence of DJK using generalized linear modeling both as one overall model and as submodels using baseline demographic and clinical predictors or surgical predictors.


RESULTS
One hundred seventeen CD patients were included. At any postoperative visit up to 1 yr, 23.1% of CD patients developed DJK. DJK was predicted with high accuracy using a combination of baseline demographic, clinical, and surgical factors by the following factors: preoperative neurological deficit, use of transition rod, C2-C7 lordosis (CL)<-12°, T1 slope minus CL > 31°, and cSVA > 54 mm. In the model using only baseline demographic/clinical predictors of DJK, presence of comorbidities, presence of baseline neurological deficit, and high preoperative C2-T3 angle were included in the final model (area under the curve = 87%). The final model using only surgical predictors for DJK included combined approach, posterior upper instrumented vertebrae below C4, use of transition rod, lack of anterior corpectomy, more than 3 posterior osteotomies, and performance of a 3-column osteotomy.


CONCLUSION
Preoperative assessment and consideration should be given to these factors that are predictive of DJK to mitigate poor outcomes.",Samantha R Horn;Cheongeun Oh;Renaud Lafage;Virginie Lafage;Justin S Smith;Breton Line;Themistocles S Protopsaltis;Mitsuru Yagi;Cole A Bortz;Frank A Segreto;Haddy Alas;Bassel G Diebo;Daniel M Sciubba;Michael P Kelly;Alan H Daniels;Eric O Klineberg;Douglas C Burton;Robert A Hart;Frank J Schwab;Shay Bess;Christopher I Shaffrey;Christopher P Ames
1127,Maximilian Nunninger,"PURPOSE
To develop and evaluate a technical approach for CT-guided periradicular infiltration using quantitative needle access and guidance parameters extracted from CT scout images.


METHODS
Five 3D-printed phantoms of the abdomen mimicking different patients were used to develop a technical approach for scout-guided periradicular infiltration. The needle access point, puncture depth, and needle angulation were calculated using measurements extracted from anterior-posterior and lateral CT scout images. Fifty needle placements were performed with the technique thus developed. Dose exposure and number of image acquisitions were compared with ten procedures performed using a conventional free-hand technique. Data were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test.


RESULTS
Parameters derived solely from scout images provided adequate guidance for successful and reliable needle placement. Needle guidance was performed with the same equipment as the standard periradicular infiltration. Two scout images and 3.5 ± 2.3 (mean ± SD) single-shot images for needle positioning were acquired. Mean DLP ± SD was 3.8 ± 2.5 mGy cm. The number of single-shot acquisitions was reduced by 68% and the overall dose was reduced by 84% in comparison with the conventional free-hand technique (p < 0.0001).

Scout-guided needle placement for periradicular infiltration is feasible and reduces radiation exposure significantly.",Victor Paul Bela Braun;Marco Ziegert;Felix Benjamin Schwarz;Bernd Hamm;Michael Scheel;Paul Jahnke
1128,Pei-Ju Chen,"The butterfly Papilio xuthus has acute tetrachromatic color vision. Its eyes are furnished with eight spectral classes of photoreceptors, situated in three types of ommatidia, randomly distributed in the retinal mosaic. Here, we investigated early chromatic information processing by recording spectral, angular, and polarization sensitivities of photoreceptors and lamina monopolar cells (LMCs). We identified three spectral classes of LMCs whose spectral sensitivities corresponded to weighted linear sums of the spectral sensitivities of the photoreceptors present in the three ommatidial types. In ~ 25% of the photoreceptor axons, the spectral sensitivities differed from those recorded at the photoreceptor cell bodies. These axons showed spectral opponency, most likely mediated by chloride ion currents through histaminergic interphotoreceptor synapses. The opponency was most prominent in the processes of the long visual fibers in the medulla. We recalculated the wavelength discrimination function using the noise-limited opponency model to reflect the new spectral sensitivity data and found that it matched well with the behaviorally determined function. Our results reveal opponency at the first stage of Papilio's visual system, indicating that spectral information is preprocessed with signals from photoreceptors within each ommatidium in the lamina, before being conveyed downstream by the long visual fibers and the LMCs.",Gregor Belušič;Kentaro Arikawa
1129,Karen Binkley,"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a devastating posttraumatic neuroinflammatory condition with both autoinflammatory and autoimmune features, characterized by unrelenting severe pain and disability, with the majority of affected patients being unable to function socially or vocationally. Remission is more likely in children than adults, and if treatment is started early. Once established, there are no universally effective treatments, and these are desperately needed. A single limb is often involved, but there can be multi-limb spread, and systemic autonomic manifestations. We describe a case of long-standing CRPS with multi-limb spread and systemic autonomic features, controlled only with very high dose oral corticosteroids, which led to several complications. Multiple other treatment modalities failed or were insufficient to control the CRPS and allow tapering of the corticosteroids, but the patient had a dramatic response to hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), allowing a reduction in prednisone dose to just over the physiologic range. When symptoms started to increase several months later, a second course of HBOT treatments allowed reduction in prednisone dose into the physiologic range while still controlling CRPS symptoms. This case is unique in that it shows that HBOT can be effective in long-standing CRPS, both initially, and for subsequent flares, and adds to the evidence supporting HBOT as a potential treatment for this condition.

1130,Emanuele Bartolini,"Genetic brain channelopathies result from inherited or de novo mutations of genes encoding ion channel subunits within the central nervous system. Most neurological channelopathies arise in childhood with paroxysmal or episodic symptoms, likely because of a transient impairment of homeostatic mechanisms regulating membrane excitability, and the prototypical expression of this impairment is epilepsy. Migraine, episodic ataxia and alternating hemiplegia can also occur, as well as chronic phenotypes, such as spinocerebellar ataxias, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels may be involved. In most cases, a single gene may be associated with a phenotypical spectrum that shows variable expressivity. Different clinical features may arise at different ages and the adult phenotype may be remarkably modified from the syndrome onset in childhood or adolescence. Recognizing the prominent phenotypical traits of brain channelopathies is essential to perform appropriate diagnostic investigations and to provide the better care not only in the paediatric setting but also for adult patients and their caregivers. Herein, we provide an overview of genetic brain channelopathies associated with epilepsy, highlight the different molecular mechanisms and describe the different clinical characteristics which may prompt the clinician to suspect specific syndromes and to possibly establish tailored treatments.",Roberto Campostrini;Lorenzo Kiferle;Silvia Pradella;Eleonora Rosati;Krishna Chinthapalli;Pasquale Palumbo

Interoception is the basic process enabling evaluation of one's own internal state of body, but its alteration in brain-damaged patients has not been adequately investigated. Our study aimed to investigate awareness of visceral and somatosensorial sensations in brain-damaged patients with unilateral stroke.


METHODS
Sixty patients (22 with left brain damage, LP; 25 with right brain damage without neglect, RPN-; and 13 with right brain-damage and extrapersonal and/or personal neglect, RPN+) and 45 healthy controls (HC) completed the Self-Awareness Questionnaire (SAQ), a self-report tool for assessing interoceptive awareness with two domains related to visceral (VD) and somatosensory feelings (SD), respectively.


RESULTS
Comparing the SAQ subdomains scores between three groups of patients (LP, RPN-, and RPN+) and HC, we found that RPN+ had significantly lower scores on VD than HC and LP, whereas no significant difference was found on scores of SD between groups.


CONCLUSION
Our results support the hypothesis of a right-hemispheric dominance for ""interoceptive neural network"" suggesting that processing of visceral sensations would be located mainly in the right hemisphere. Therefore, a careful assessment of interoceptive awareness in clinical practice would be useful to improve rehabilitation and to engage patients with deficit of interoceptive awareness in developing greater accuracy of body signals.",Maddalena Boccia;Antonella Di Vita;Teresa Iona;Maria Cropano;Antonio Ammendolia;Roberto Colao;Maurizio Iocco;Valentina Angelillo;Cecilia Guariglia;Dario Grossi;Liana Palermo
1133,Miren Ettcheto,"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a catechin found in green tea, has been previously investigated for its neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate its possible beneficial effects in a well-established preclinical mixed model of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on the use of transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice fed with a high fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice were used in this study. APP/PS1 mice were fed with a palmitic acid-enriched HFD (APP/PS1 HFD) containing 45% of fat mainly from hydrogenated coconut oil. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IP-GTT) and insulin tolerance tests (IP-ITT) were performed. Western blot analyses were performed to analyse protein expression, and water maze and novel object recognition test were done to evaluate the cognitive process. EGCG treatment improves peripheral parameters such as insulin sensitivity or liver insulin pathway signalling, as well as central memory deficits. It also markedly increased synaptic markers and cAMP response element binding (CREB) phosphorylation rates, as a consequence of a decrease in the unfolded protein response (UPR) activation through the reduction in the activation factor 4 (ATF4) levels and posterior downregulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Moreover, EGCG significantly decreased brain amyloid β (Aβ) production and plaque burden by increasing the levels of α-secretase (ADAM10). Also, it led to a reduction in neuroinflammation, as suggested by the decrease in astrocyte reactivity and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) levels. Collectively, evidence suggests that chronic EGCG prevents distinct neuropathological AD-related hallmarks. This study also provides novel insights into the metabolic and neurobiological mechanisms of EGCG against cognitive loss through its effects on UPR function, suggesting that this compound may be a promising disease-modifying treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.",Amanda Cano;Patricia R Manzine;Oriol Busquets;Ester Verdaguer;Rubén Dario Castro-Torres;Maria Luisa García;Carlos Beas-Zarate;Jordi Olloquequi;Carme Auladell;Jaume Folch;Antoni Camins
1134,Maria Czarnek,"Neuregulin 2 (NRG2) belongs to the EGF family of growth factors. Most of this family members require proteolytic cleavage to liberate their ectodomains capable of binding and activating their cognate ErbB receptors. To date, most of the studies investigating proteolytic processing of neuregulins focused on NRG1, which was shown to undergo ectodomain shedding by several ADAM proteases and BACE1 and the remaining fragment was further cleaved by γ-secretase. Recently, NRG2 attracted more attention due to its role in the neurogenesis and modulation of behaviors associated with psychiatric disorders. In this study, we used genetic engineering methods to identify proteases involved in proteolytic processing of murine NRG2. Using non-neuronal cell lines as well as cultures of primary hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that the major proteases responsible for releasing NRG2 ectodomain are ADAM10 and BACE2. Co-expression of NRG2 and BACE2 in neurons of certain brain structures including medulla oblongata and cerebellar deep nuclei was confirmed via immunohistochemical staining. The cleavage of NRG2 by ADAM10 or BACE2 generates a C-terminal fragment that serves as a substrate for γ-secretase. We also showed that murine NRG2 is subject to post-translational modifications, substantial glycosylation of its extracellular part, and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail.",Joanna Bereta
1135,Jian Jiao,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with high phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Whole-exome sequencing studies have shown that de novo single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) play an important role in sporadic ASD. The present study aimed to search for de novo SNVs using whole-exome sequencing in 59 unrelated Chinese ASD sporadic trios, and found 24 genes (including five reported ASD candidate genes CACNA1D, ACHE, YY1, TTN, and FBXO11) with de novo harmful SNVs. Five genes (CACNA1D, JAK2, ACHE, MAPK7, and PRKAG2) classified as ""medium-confidence"" genes were found to be related to ASD using the Phenolyzer gene analysis tool, which predicts the correlation between the candidate genes and the ASD phenotype. De novo SNVs in JAK2, MAPK7, and PRKAG2 were first found in ASD. Both JAK2 and MAPK7 were involved in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Gene co-expression and inter-gene interaction networks were constructed and gene expression data in different brain regions were further extracted, revealing that JAK2 and MAPK7 genes were associated with certain previously reported ASD genes and played an important role in early brain development. The findings of this study suggest that the aforementioned five reported ASD genes and JAK2 and MAPK7 may be related to ASD susceptibility. Further investigations of expression studies in cellular and animal models are needed to explore the mechanism underlying the involvement of JAK2 and MAPK7 in ASD.",Manxue Zhang;Pingyuan Yang;Yan Huang;Xiao Hu;Jia Cai;Chan Yang;Mingjing Situ;Hui Zhang;Lei Fu;Kuifang Guo;Yi Huang

To study ten year change in MS prevalence in Province of Western Finland in Tampere University Hospital District located in 62.7° N, 23.7° E.


METHODS
Age standardized prevalence/105 by using direct standardization in European Standard Population (ESP2013) and crude prevalence/105 with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was assessed among resident MS cases fulfilling Poser criteria by sex and disease course in 31.12.2000 and 31.12.2010. MS related disability and disease modifying treatment (DMT) use were estimated in 31.12.2010.


RESULTS
Crude prevalence increased 49% from 129/105 (95% CI 121-137) in 2000 (N 1080) to 196/105 (187-203) in 2010 (N 1666). Age standardized prevalence increased 45% from 133/105 (127-140) to 192/105 (184-200) and peaked in 40-49 year age group. Age standardized prevalence increased 58% among women from 176/105 (171-176) to 277/105 (270-284) and 31% among men from 91/105 (87-95) to 119/105 (115-124). Increase in RRMS was 61% from 111/105 (105-117) to 179/105 (171-186) and decrease in PPMS was 14% from 21/105 (19-24) to 18/105 (15-21). In 2010 among the 52% RRMS cases on DMT, MS related disability was mild in 50%. In total cohort disability was mild in 46%, moderate to severe in 47%, information was not available in 14%.

The cost-effectiveness of available pharmacological treatments for narcolepsy is largely unknown. Available pharmacological treatments are associated with tolerability, abuse and adherence issues. Pitolisant is the first inverse agonist of the histamine H3 receptor to be prescribed for the treatment of narcolepsy with and without cataplexy. Studies suggest that pitolisant is both as effective as previously introduced drugs and is associated with fewer adverse effects. The objective in this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of pitolisant as monotherapy, and pitolisant as an adjunctive treatment to modafinil, compared to standard treatment.


MATERIALS & METHODS
Calculations were performed using a Markov model with a 50-year time horizon. Healthcare utilisation and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each treatment alternative were calculated assuming no treatment effect on survival. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed for treatment effectiveness and healthcare cost parameters.


RESULTS
The cost per additional quality-adjusted life year was estimated at SEK 356 337 (10 SEK ≈1 Euro) for pitolisant monotherapy, and at SEK 491 128 for pitolisant as an adjunctive treatment, as compared to standard treatment. The cost-effectiveness measure was demonstrated to be particularly sensitive to the assumptions made concerning indirect effects on total healthcare utilization and the pitolisant treatment cost.


CONCLUSIONS
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below the unofficial willingness-to-pay threshold at SEK 500 000. The estimated costs per additional QALY obtained here are likely to overestimate the true cost-effectiveness ratio since significant potential indirect effects - pertaining both to labour-market and household-related productivity - of treatment are not taken into account.",Per-Åke Niska;Laura Pirhonen;Pontus Wasling;Anne-Marie Landtblom

Drug resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) remains challenging despite a favorable overall prognosis of IGE and little is known about basic epidemiology and long-term outcome of drug resistant IGE. We aimed at describing the incidence, prevalence, and outcome of IGE in an unbiased, population-based cohort.


METHODS
In 2014-2018, all patients (≥17 years) with IGE inhabiting the island of Funen (496,000 inhabitants) were recruited. We assessed socioeconomic and clinical information available for 406 individuals. Median follow-up was 15 years.


RESULTS
The average IGE incidence (2008-2017) was 2.9/100,000 inhabitants/year. The point prevalence of identifiable IGE patients was 1.0/1,000 adults (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: 0.4/1,000; absence epilepsy: 0.3/1,000, epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone: 0.3/1,000), 92.1% of the patients were diagnosed before 25 years of age. When correcting for unequal age distribution in the cohort, 1,102 people on the island of Funen fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for IGE at the age of 25 (estimated prevalence: 2.7/1,000 adults). In the year before data closure, 121 patients reported seizures. Fifty patients met the definition of drug resistant IGE (12.1% of the cohort, 4.5% of the estimated 1,102 IGE patients). The average seizure burden of all patients with drug resistant IGE was 2.2 generalized tonic-clonic seizures/year, only 14 patients suffered more than two generalized tonic-clonic seizures/year. Drug resistant IGE was associated with an increased risk of requiring treatment for affective disorders and a reduced probability of working fulltime.


CONCLUSION
IGE was associated with a low risk of persistent drug resistant seizures requiring specialist medical attention. Drug resistance was associated with a negative socioeconomic outcome.",Jakob Christensen;Helle Hjalgrim;Guido Rubboli;Christoph P Beier

Mutations in optineurin (OPTN) have been identified in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We screened a cohort of Chinese patients for mutations in optineurin. We also performed an extensive literatures review of all mutations in optineurin identified previously to detect genotype-phenotype associations.


METHODS
All 16 exons of the OPTN gene in a cohort of 15 familial ALS indexes and 275 sporadic ALS patients of Chinese origin were sequenced by targeted next generation sequencing.


RESULTS
Two known heterozygous missense mutations in the OPTN, c.1481T> G (p.L494W), and c.1546G> C (p.E516Q), as well as one novel heterozygous missense mutation c.1690G> C (p.D564H) were each detected in one sporadic ALS patient. The patient carrying the p.E516Q mutation developed clinical features of ALS-frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and the patient carrying the p.D564H mutation showed a phenotype of ALS. They both had an aggressive course, with a survival of 18 and 14 months respectively. Literature review showed that the clinical phenotypes in OPTN mutated ALS were not homogeneous, although some individuals showed a relatively slow progression and a long duration, some mutations carriers developed an aggressive progression and a short survival.

This study compared sleep disturbances between older adults living in nursing home located in high- and low-altitude areas and explored the association between sleep disturbances and quality of life (QoL).


METHOD
In total, 207 participants living in a high-altitude area and 437 participants in a low-altitude area were included. Sleep disturbances (ie, difficulty in initiating sleep, difficulty in maintaining sleep, and early morning awakening) were measured using standardized questions. The independent demographic and clinical correlates of sleep disturbances in high-altitude area were examined using multiple logistic regression analyses. Each type of sleep disturbance was entered as the dependent variable separately, while those with significant group differences in the univariate analyses (ie, male gender, married status, age and depressive symptoms) were entered as independent variables.


RESULTS
The prevalence of any type of sleep disturbances in the whole sample was 26.09%, with 41.54% in the high-altitude area and 18.76% in the low-altitude area. Physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL domains were negatively associated with sleep disturbances in high-altitude area. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that male gender and married status were less likely to have sleep disturbances, while those with more severe depressive symptoms were more likely to have sleep disturbances in high-altitude area.


CONCLUSION
Sleep disturbance is common among older nursing home residents in high-altitude areas. Considering the negative impact of sleep disturbance on QoL, regular screening and treatment strategies need to be developed directly for this population.",Ines H I Chow;Li Lu;Yan-Ming Ren;Hui-Lian Yang;Sheng-Yan Jian;Chee H Ng;Gabor S Ungvari;Fei Wang;Yu-Tao Xiang

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder characterized by severe neurological manifestations, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, and a range of other behavioral and psychiatric symptoms, collectively referred to as TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND). Various tumors and hamartomas affecting different organs are the pathological hallmarks of the disease, especially cortical tubers of the brain, but specific cellular and molecular abnormalities, such as involving the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, have been identified that also cause or contribute to neurological manifestations of TSC independent of gross structural lesions. In particular, while neurons are immediate mediators of neurological symptoms, different types of glial cells have been increasingly recognized to play important roles in the phenotypes of TSC.


MAIN BODY
This review summarizes the literature supporting glial dysfunction from both mouse models and clinical studies of TSC. In particular, evidence for the role of astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and TAND in TSC is analyzed. Therapeutic implications of targeting glia cells in developing novel treatments for the neurological manifestations of TSC are also considered.


CONCLUSIONS
Different types of glial cells have both cell autonomous effects and interactions with neurons and other cells that are involved in the pathophysiology of the neurological phenotype of TSC. Targeting glial-mediated mechanisms may represent a novel therapeutic approach for epilepsy and TAND in TSC patients.",

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is prevalent in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), occurring in approximately 50% of patients, and is hypothesized to be caused by disruption of neural circuits early in life. Tubers, or benign hamartomas distributed stochastically throughout the brain, are the most conspicuous of TSC neuropathology, but have not been consistently associated with ASD. Widespread neuropathology of the white matter, including deficits in myelination, neuronal migration, and axon formation, exist and may underlie ASD in TSC. We sought to identify the neural circuits associated with ASD in TSC by identifying white matter microstructural deficits in a prospectively recruited, longitudinally studied cohort of TSC infants.


METHODS
TSC infants were recruited within their first year of life and longitudinally imaged at time of recruitment, 12 months of age, and at 24 months of age. Autism was diagnosed at 24 months of age with the ADOS-2. There were 108 subjects (62 TSC-ASD, 55% male; 46 TSC+ASD, 52% male) with at least one MRI and a 24-month ADOS, for a total of 187 MRI scans analyzed (109 TSC-ASD; 78 TSC+ASD). Diffusion tensor imaging properties of multiple white matter fiber bundles were sampled using a region of interest approach. Linear mixed effects modeling was performed to test the hypothesis that infants who develop ASD exhibit poor white matter microstructural integrity over the first 2 years of life compared to those who do not develop ASD.


RESULTS
Subjects with TSC and ASD exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy in 9 of 17 white matter regions, sampled from the arcuate fasciculus, cingulum, corpus callosum, anterior limbs of the internal capsule, and the sagittal stratum, over the first 2 years of life compared to TSC subjects without ASD. Mean diffusivity trajectories did not differ between groups.

Hallmarks of this progression are seen when children reach developmental milestones, forming the foundation of language. Expressive language milestones, such as the production of a child's first word, are delayed in 5-8% of children. While for some children delays in reaching these milestones are harbingers of developmental disorders, for others expressive language delays appear to resolve. Regardless of whether or not early language skills appear resolved, difficulty with later comprehension is a likely outcome. Whether this heightened risk for poor comprehension differs based on text features, individual characteristics, or receipt of intervention remains unknown. Moreover, this relationship between expressive language development and comprehension is not yet linked to neurobiology, though the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) is a potential neurobiological correlate. Therefore, we investigated the impact of, and interactions between, expressive language development, early intervention, and the ILF on comprehension.


METHODS
Longitudinal recurrent survival analyses predicted the risk of answering a comprehension question incorrectly. Predictors of comprehension included expressive language development, passage features, participant characteristics, fractional anisotropy, receipt of early intervention, and later diagnosis of speech or language disorders.


RESULTS
Children with later expressive language milestones had poorer comprehension. When comprehension text features were examined, children with later milestones had poorer listening and reading comprehension, and poorer narrative and expository comprehension. The left ILF acted as a neurodevelopmental correlate, one that moderated the relationship between expressive language milestones and comprehension. Specifically, the left ILF exacerbated the relationship for those who did not receive early intervention and buffered the relationship for those who received intervention services. Early intervention decreased the risk of poor comprehension by 39% for children later diagnosed with a speech or language disorder.


CONCLUSIONS
Early intervention should be provided for children with delayed expressive language milestones, particularly those who are at risk for speech or language disorders. The ILF plays a critical role in the relationship between expressive language development and comprehension, which may be that of a protective factor for children with the most severe early issues with speech and language.",F Sayako Earle;Laurie E Cutting

The mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase proteins (mt-aaRSs) are a group of nuclear-encoded enzymes that facilitate conjugation of each of the 20 amino acids to its cognate tRNA molecule. Mitochondrial diseases are a large, clinically heterogeneous group of disorders with diverse etiologies, ages of onset, and involved organ systems. Diseases related to mt-aaRS mutations are associated with specific syndromes that affect the central nervous system and produce highly characteristic MRI patterns, prototypically the DARS2, EARS, and AARS2 leukodystrophies, which are caused by mutations in mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, mitochondria glutamate tRNA synthetase, and mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase, respectively. BODY: The disease patterns emerging for these leukodystrophies are distinct in terms of the age of onset, nature of disease progression, and predominance of involved white matter tracts. In DARS2 and EARS2 disorders, earlier disease onset is typically correlated with more significant brain abnormalities, rapid neurological decline, and greater disability. In AARS2 leukodystrophy cases reported thus far, there is nearly invariable progression to severe disability and atrophy of involved brain regions, often within a decade. Although most mutations are compound heterozygous inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, homozygous variants are found in each disorder and demonstrate high phenotypic variability. Affected siblings manifest disease on a wide spectrum.


CONCLUSION
The syndromic nature and selective vulnerability of white matter tracts in these disorders suggests there may be a shared mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction to target for study. There is evidence that the clinical variability and white matter tract specificity of each mt-aaRS leukodystrophy depend on both canonical and non-canonical effects of the mutations on the process of mitochondrial translation. Furthermore, different sensitivities to the mt-aaRS mutations have been observed based on cell type. Most mutations result in at least partial retention of mt-aaRS enzyme function with varied effects on the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. In EARS2 and AARS2 cells, this appears to result in cumulative impairment of respiration. Mt-aaRS mutations may also affect alternative biochemical pathways such as the integrated stress response, a homeostatic program in eukaryotic cells that typically confers cytoprotection, but can lead to cell death when abnormally activated in response to pathologic states. Systematic review of this group of disorders and further exploration of disease mechanisms in disease models and neural cells are warranted.",Christina L Nemeth;Miriam L Kaufman;Ali Fatemi

The core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are widely theorized to result from altered brain connectivity. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) has been a versatile method for investigating underlying microstructural properties of white matter (WM) in ASD. Despite phenotypic and etiological heterogeneity, DWI studies in majority male samples of older children, adolescents, and adults with ASD have largely reported findings of decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) across several commissural, projection, and association fiber tracts. However, studies in preschool-aged children (i.e., < 30-40 months) suggest individuals with ASD have increased measures of WM FA earlier in development.


METHODS
We analyzed 127 individuals with ASD (85♂, 42♀) and 54 typically developing (TD) controls (42♂, 26♀), aged 25.1-49.6 months. Voxel-wise effects of ASD diagnosis, sex, age, and their interaction on DWI measures of FA, mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were investigated using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) while controlling mean absolute and relative motion.


RESULTS
Compared to TD controls, males and females with ASD had significantly increased measures of FA in eight clusters (threshold-free cluster enhancement p < 0.05) that incorporated several WM tracts including regions of the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculi, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, and corticospinal tract. A diagnosis by sex interaction was observed in measures of AD across six significant clusters incorporating areas of the body, genu, and splenium of the corpus collosum. In these tracts, females with ASD showed increased AD compared to TD females, while males with ASD showed decreased AD compared to TD males.


CONCLUSIONS
The current findings support growing evidence that preschool-aged children with ASD have atypical measures of WM microstructure that appear to differ in directionality from alterations observed in older individuals with the condition. To our knowledge, this study represents the largest sample of preschool-aged females with ASD to be evaluated using DWI. Microstructural differences associated with ASD largely overlapped between sexes. However, differential relationships of AD measures indicate that sex likely modulates ASD neuroanatomical phenotypes. Further longitudinal study is needed to confirm and quantify the developmental relationship of WM structure in ASD.",Joshua K Lee;Marjorie Solomon;Sally J Rogers;David G Amaral;Christine Wu Nordahl
1147,Allison E Zanno,"BACKGROUND
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication of pregnancy and is associated with significant neurological deficits in infants, including white matter damage. Previous work using an animal model of IUGR has demonstrated that IUGR rats exhibit neurobehavioral deficits and developmental delays in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, but the mechanisms which cause this delay are unknown. Inflammation may be an important etiological factor in IUGR and has been recognized as playing a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of myelin disorders, including cerebral palsy.


METHODS
To create the model, the uterine arteries of pregnant rats were ligated at embryonic day 15. Rats delivered spontaneously. Cytokine and chemokine expression was evaluated at one prenatal and three postnatal time points, and myelin protein expression and oligodendrocyte cell numbers were evaluated by several methods at postnatal day 14. IL-4 was identified as a potential inhibitor of myelination, and rat pups were injected with IL-4 function blocking antibody from postnatal days 1-5 and myelination was assessed.


RESULTS
Here, we show a novel mechanism of white matter injury. IUGR induces an exaggerated Th2 response in the developing rat brain, including upregulation of several Th2 cytokines. Of these, IL-4 is significantly increased during the period corresponding to robust developmental myelination. We show that neutralizing IL-4 antibody therapy given in the newborn period ameliorates inflammation and restores myelin protein expression and oligodendrocyte cell number in the IUGR brain to control levels, demonstrating a novel role for Th2 responses and IL-4 in IUGR and white matter injury. In addition, IL-4 directly affects oligodendrocytes in vitro decreasing differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we have identified inflammation as a factor in the decrease in myelin seen in an animal model of IUGR. IL-4, an inflammatory protein often thought to be protective in the adult, is specifically increased, and treatment of these animals to prevent this increase ameliorates white matter damage. Our results suggest that the immune system plays a role in IUGR that is different in the perinatal period than in the adult and preventing this exaggerated Th2 response may be a potential therapeutic target.",Micah A Romer;Lauren Fox;Thea Golden;Lane Jaeckle-Santos;Rebecca A Simmons;Judith B Grinspan
1148,Meghan R Swanson,"BACKGROUND
Early intervention is a valuable tool to support the development of toddlers with neurodevelopmental disorders. With recent research advances in early identification that allow for pre-symptomatic detection of autism in infancy, scientists are looking forward to intervention during infancy. These advances may be supported by the identification of biologically based treatment and outcome measures that are sensitive and dimensional. The purpose of this review is to evaluate white matter neurodevelopment as a monitoring biomarker for early treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as used as exemplars. White matter has unique neurobiology, including a prolonged period of dynamic development. This developmental pattern may make white matter especially responsive to treatment. White matter develops aberrantly in children with ASD and FXS. Histologic studies in rodents have provided targets for FXS pharmacological intervention. However, pharmaceutical clinical trials in humans failed to garner positive clinical results. In this article, we argue that the use of neurobiological monitoring biomarkers may overcome some of these limitations, as they are objective, not susceptible to placebo effects, and are dimensional in nature.


SHORT CONCLUSION
As the field moves towards earlier detection and early intervention for neurodevelopmental disorders, we encourage scientists to consider the advantages of using neurobiological features as monitoring biomarkers.",Heather C Hazlett
1149,Nadine M Aziz,"BACKGROUND
Down syndrome (DS), caused by the triplication of chromosome 21, results in a constellation of clinical features including changes in intellectual and motor function. Although altered neural development and function have been well described in people with DS, few studies have investigated the etiology underlying the observed motor phenotypes. Here, we examine the development, patterning, and organization of the spinal cord throughout life in the Ts65Dn mouse, a model that recapitulates many of the motor changes observed in people with DS.


METHODS
Spinal cords from embryonic to adult animals were processed for gene and protein expression (immunofluorescence) to track the spatiotemporal development of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and oligodendroglia. Postnatal analyses were focused on the lumbar region due to the reflex and gait abnormalities found in Ts65Dn mice and locomotive alterations seen in people with DS.


RESULTS
Between embryonic days E10.5 and E14.5, we found a larger motor neuron progenitor domain in Ts65Dn animals containing more OLIG2-expressing progenitor cells. These disturbed progenitors are delayed in motor neuron production but eventually generate a large number of ISL1+ migrating motor neurons. We found that higher numbers of PAX6+ and NKX2.2+ interneurons (INs) are also produced during this time frame. In the adult lumbar spinal cord, we found an increased level of Hb9 and a decreased level of Irx3 gene expression in trisomic animals. This was accompanied by an increase in Calretinin+ INs, but no changes in other neuronal populations. In aged Ts65Dn animals, both Calbindin+ and ChAT+ neurons were decreased compared to euploid controls. Additionally, in the dorsal corticospinal white matter tract, there were significantly fewer CC1+ mature OLs in 30- and 60-day old trisomic animals and this normalized to euploid levels at 10-11 months. In contrast, the mature OL population was increased in the lateral funiculus, an ascending white matter tract carrying sensory information. In 30-day old animals, we also found a decrease in the number of nodes of Ranvier in both tracts. This decrease normalized both in 60-day old and aged animals.


CONCLUSIONS
We show marked changes in both spinal white matter and neuronal composition that change regionally over the life span. In the embryonic Ts65Dn spinal cord, we observe alterations in motor neuron production and migration. In the adult spinal cord, we observe changes in oligodendrocyte maturation and motor neuron loss, the latter of which has also been observed in human spinal cord tissue samples. This work uncovers multiple cellular perturbations during Ts65Dn development and aging, many of which may underlie the motor deficits found in DS.",Jenny A Klein;Morgan R Brady;Jose Luis Olmos-Serrano;Vittorio Gallo;Tarik F Haydar
1150,Christian Meisel,"Epilepsy treatment is challenging due to a lack of essential diagnostic tools, including methods for reliable seizure detection in the ambulatory setting, to assess seizure risk over time and to monitor treatment efficacy. This lack of objective diagnostics constitutes a significant barrier to better treatments, raises methodological concerns about the antiseizure medication evaluation process and, to patients, is a main issue contributing to the disease burden. Recent years have seen rapid progress towards better diagnostics that meet these needs of epilepsy patients and clinicians. Availability of comprehensive data and the rise of more powerful computational analysis methods have driven progress in this area. Here, we provide an overview on data- and theory-driven approaches aimed at identifying methods to reliably detect and forecast seizures as well as to monitor brain excitability and treatment efficacy in epilepsy. We provide a particular account on neural criticality, the hypothesis that cortical networks may be poised in a critical state at the boundary between different types of dynamics, and discuss its role in informing diagnostics to track cortex excitability and seizure risk in recent experiments. With the further expansion of digitalization in medicine, tele-medicine and long-term, ambulatory monitoring, these computationally based methods may gain more relevance in epilepsy  in the future.",Tobias Loddenkemper
1151,Alaina L Pearce,"Negative effects of obesity on memory and associated medial temporal circuitry have been noted in animal models, but the status in humans, particularly children, is not well established. Our study is the first to examine neural correlates of successful memory encoding of visual scenes and their associated context in adolescents with severe obesity (age 14-18 years, 43% male). Despite similar subsequent memory as adolescents without obesity (BMI for age and sex <95th percentile), those with severe obesity (BMI for age and sex 120% above the 95th percentile) showed reduced hippocampal, parahippocampal, frontal, and parietal engagement during encoding of remembered visual scenes and greater lateral temporal engagement during encoding of their associated context. Standardized testing revealed a trend level group difference in memory performance, with a larger magnitude of obesity-related difference in recollection-related memory that was mediated by individual differences in lateral temporal activation during contextual encoding. The observed widespread functional alterations are concerning in light of the importance of mnemonic processing for academic achievement and feeding behavior and underscore the need for prevention and intervention initiatives for pediatric obesity.",Eleanor Mackey;J Bradley C Cherry;Alexandra Olson;Xiaozhen You;Evan P Nadler;Chandan J Vaidya
1152,Natascia De Lucia,"OBJECTIVE
Weight loss is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported that low Body Mass Index (BMI) is associated with disease progression in these patients, but only a few data are available on the relationship between BMI and cognitive dysfunctions in PD patients. In the present study we systematically assessed the possible relationship between BMI index and specific cognitive defects.


METHOD
We enrolled a prospective sample of 37 PD individuals and 30 healthy controls (HC) of similar age, sex, and education. The BMI was calculated in each participant, who underwent a neuropsychological assessment exploring the general cognitive skills, frontal/executive, visuo-spatial, visuo-constructional and memory abilities.


RESULTS
We showed that PD group had significant lower BMI value compared to HC group. In PD patients, the BMI was negatively correlated to disease duration and number of errors at the Stroop-Color Word Test, and positively to score on Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Moreover, a regression analysis revealed that, the BMI in PD patients was associated with disease duration and score on FAB.

1153,Minori Furuta,"In clinical settings, it is often difficult to distinguish inclusion body myositis (IBM) from other neuromuscular diseases. In order to clarify clinically useful characteristics for making the differential diagnosis of IBM, we performed clinical, epidemiological, and neuroimaging analyses in patients with various types of neuromuscular disorders. We enrolled 333 patients with myopathy and 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who had been hospitalized in our department from January 1, 1979, to December 31, 2018. Among them, 18 patients with IBM, 16 patients with polymyositis (PM), and 12 patients with ALS who showed equivalent severity of muscle weakness in their lower limbs underwent the quantitative neuroimaging analysis using lower limb CT and clinical assessment. Patients with IBM exhibited significantly greater muscular degeneration in the rectus femoris, vastus, sartorius, adductor, anterior calf, and medial gastrocnemius muscles than those with PM or ALS. The ratio of the remaining muscle area of the quadriceps relative to that of the hamstrings and the duration from onset to CT imaging were negatively correlated in patients with IBM, indicating that the anterior thigh muscles were preferentially affected over the posterior muscles. Characteristic muscular degeneration in the lower limbs on CT imaging may aid for making the diagnosis of IBM.",Natsumi Furuta;Kazuaki Nagashima;Yukio Fujita;Yoshito Tsushima;Yoshio Ikeda
1154,M Burhan Janjua,"Colloid cyst are cystic lesions in the third ventricle and could render patients asymptomatic. However, there is an inherent risk of symptomatic progression, acute decompensation, and sudden death. Therefore, there is no clear consensus as how to observe or when to treat a newly diagnosed patient with a colloid cyst. The authors' objective is to identify the risk factors and then develop a risk stratification score to guide neurosurgeons during acute or chronic presentation. Radiological imaging characteristics have been outlined for the risk stratification as well preoperative evaluation. A baseline neuropsychological evaluation is helpful to obtain during an incidental presentation because history and neurological examination could be inconclusive in these cases. Radiological imaging with an MRI brain scan plays a vital role for the initial screening (determination of the cyst size, exact location, and the imaging characteristics) as well as for the preoperative planning. Stereotactic guidance is a high yield, followed by neuroendoscopic resection of the colloid cyst has been an established approach to resect these lesions. Modified colloid cyst risk scoring (mCCRS) system is robust and detailed for the optimal risk stratification of colloid cyst presentation. Stereotactic guided neuroendoscopic resection of the colloid cyst is a safe and efficacious approach to manage these lesions. The intended use, crucial steps involved, and the limitations of the technique have been discussed especially with a focus on the recurrence.

A retrospective chart review was performed by interrogating our procedure log system and the key words ""anterior cervical discectomy and fusion"" was inserted in to the search bar. All patients with a four level ACDF were selected. Chart review was performed for their speech evaluation immediate after surgery and three months post operatively. A total of 28 patients were identified for the study. Speech evaluation records were available for 21 of the 28 patients. Two of the patients had posterior instrumentation and were eliminated. There were 11 females and 8 males, average age was 62 (range 47-73), and all the patients had a C3-C7 ACDF. 2 out of the 19 (11%) patients had dysphagia diagnosed via barium swallow evaluation immediately after surgery, which persisted for 3 months. Both patients diagnosed with dysphagia were females. The Two patients were 72 and 73 years old.

1156,Ayataka Fujimoto,"Epilepsy surgery uses both depth electrodes (DEs) and subdural electrodes (SE). DEs have mainly been developed and used in Europe. As we are able to use the DEs safely due to the current advanced level of technology, use of DEs has been increasing rapidly over the last decade. Unlike placement of SEs, which simply requires craniotomy, DE placement generally requires stereotactic techniques such as frame-based stereotactic or robotic arm-based methods. However, such methods are not always available at every epilepsy center. We therefore invented guide pipes for accurate DE placement. With this guide pipe and neuronavigation-based (NB) DE placement system, we are able to place DEs accurately. However, the disadvantages of our original procedure were a relatively large skin incision and the difficulty in anchoring DEs. The purpose of this technical note is to introduce a method to perform NB DE placement with a smaller skin incision and simple anchoring procedure. As we could make the skin incision smaller and achieved easier anchoring of DEs using a titanium plate, we hope this procedure will help facilities to perform DE placement with neuronavigation systems.",Kazuki Sakakura;Naoki Ichikawa;Tohru Okanishi
1157,Jose Gomez-Tames,"OBJECTIVE
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulation scheme that delivers a small current via electrodes placed on the scalp. The target is generally assumed to be under the electrode, but deep brain regions could also be involved due to the large current spread between the electrodes. This study aims to computationally evaluate if group-level hotspots exist in deep brain regions for different electrode montages.


METHODS
We computed the tDCS-generated electric fields (EFs) in a group of subjects using interindividual registration methods that permitted the projection of EFs from individual realistic head models (n = 18) to a standard deep brain region.


RESULTS
The spatial distribution and peak values (standard deviation of 14%) of EFs varied significantly. Nevertheless, group-level EF hotspots appeared in deep brain regions. The caudate had the highest field peaks in particular for F3-F4 montage (70% of maximum cortical EF), while other regions reach field peaks of 50%.


CONCLUSIONS
tDCS at deeper regions may include not only modulation via underlying cortical or subcortical circuits but also modulation of deep brain regions.


SIGNIFICANCE
The presented EF atlas in deep brain regions can be used to explain tDCS mechanism or select the most appropriate tDCS montage.",Akihiro Asai;Akimasa Hirata
1158,Carolin Henke,"The pathophysiology of respiratory muscle weakness in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) remains incompletely understood. 21 adult patients with DM1 (11 men, 42 ± 13 years) and 21 healthy matched controls underwent spirometry, manometry, and diaphragm ultrasound. In addition, surface electromyography of the diaphragm and the obliquus abdominis muscle was performed following cortical and posterior cervical magnetic stimulation (CMS) of the phrenic nerves or magnetic stimulation of the lower thoracic nerve roots. Magnetic stimulation was combined with invasive recording of the twitch transdiaphragmatic and gastric pressure (twPdi and twPgas) in 10 subjects per group. The following parameters were reduced in DM1 patients compared to control subjects: maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP; 40.3 ± 19.2 vs. 95.8 ± 28.5 cmH2O, p < 0.01), diaphragm thickening ratio (DTR; 2.0 ± 0.4 vs. 2.7 ± 0.6, p < 0.01), twPdi following CMS (10.8 ± 8.3 vs. 21.4 ± 10.1 cmH2O, p = 0.03), and amplitude of diaphragm compound muscle action potentials (0.10 ± 0.25 vs. 0.46 ± 0.35 mV; p = 0.04).

Color vision has been consistently shown to be unaffected in animals that are raised in dark or in color-deprived environments. However, there are only a few studies that directly addressed the effect of congenital visual deprivation in color perception in humans.


OBJECTIVE
The goal of the current study was to assess the effect of congenital visual deprivation on color vision using a panel based color arrangement test.


METHODS
We investigated the recovery of color vision using the Farnsworth D15 test in a group of individuals who had experienced visual deprivation since birth due to bilateral dense congenital cataracts before undergoing cataract-reversal surgery (Congenital cataract, CC, n = 12). In addition, we tested two groups of control participants: (1) individuals who had had non-dense congenital cataract or developed cataract later in their childhood (Developmental cataract, DC, n = 10), and (2) sighted controls with normal or corrected to normal vision (n = 14). Based on the methods proposed by Vingrys and King-Smith (1988), we derived the following metrics of color vision performance: (1) total error score, (2) confusion index, (3) confusion angle, and (4) selectivity index.


RESULTS
All of the measured indices of color vision performance were unaltered by a period of congenital visual deprivation.

Our results support the view that, development of visual functions such as color discrimination and color arrangement does not depend on typical visual experience during a sensitive phase in early childhood.",Suddha Sourav;Davide Bottari;Seema Banerjee;Idris Shareef;Ramesh Kekunnaya;Brigitte Röder
1161,Elvire Vaucher,"BACKGROUND
The cholinergic system is a potent neuromodulator system that plays a critical role in cortical plasticity, attention, and learning. Recently, it was found that boosting this system during perceptual learning robustly enhances sensory perception in rodents. In particular, pairing cholinergic activation with visual stimulation increases neuronal responses, cue detection ability, and long-term facilitation in the primary visual cortex. The mechanisms of cholinergic enhancement are closely linked to attentional processes, long-term potentiation, and modulation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance. Some studies currently examine this effect in humans.


OBJECTIVE
The present article reviews the research from our laboratory, examining whether potentiating the central cholinergic system could help visual perception and restoration.


METHODS
Electrophysiological or pharmacological enhancement of the cholinergic system are administered during a visual training. Electrophysiological responses and perceptual learning performance are investigated before and after the training in rats and humans. This approach's ability to restore visual capacities following a visual deficit induced by a partial optic nerve crush is also investigated in rats.


RESULTS
The coupling of visual training to cholinergic stimulation improved visual discrimination and visual acuity in rats, and improved residual vision after a deficit. These changes were due to muscarinic and nicotinic transmissions and were associated with a functional improvement of evoked potentials. In humans, potentiation of cholinergic transmission with 5 mg of donepezil showed improved learning and ocular dominance plasticity, although this treatment was ineffective in augmenting the perceptual threshold and electroencephalography.


CONCLUSIONS
Potential therapeutic outcomes ought to facilitate vision restoration using commercially available cholinergic agents combined with visual stimulation in order to prevent irreversible vision loss in patients. This approach has the potential to help a large population of visually impaired individuals.",Guillaume Laliberté;Marie-Charlotte Higgins;Manon Maheux;Pierre Jolicoeur;Mira Chamoun
1162,Haoliang Huang,"BACKGROUND
Permanent loss of vital functions after central nervous system (CNS) injury occurs in part because axons in the adult mammalian CNS do not regenerate after injury. PTEN was identified as a prominent intrinsic inhibitor of CNS axon regeneration about 10 years ago. The PTEN negatively regulated PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which has been intensively explored in diverse models of axon injury and diseases and its mechanism for axon regeneration is becoming clearer.


OBJECTIVE
It is timely to summarize current knowledge about the PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway and discuss future directions of translational regenerative research for neural injury and neurodegenerative diseases.


METHODS
Using mouse optic nerve crush as an in vivo retinal ganglion cell axon injury model, we have conducted an extensive molecular dissection of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1/mTORC2 pathway to illuminate the cross-regulating mechanisms in axon regeneration.


RESULTS
AKT is the nodal point that coordinates both positive (PI3K-PDK1-pAKT-T308) and negative (PI3K-mTORC2-pAKT-S473) signals to regulate adult CNS axon regeneration through two parallel pathways, activating mTORC1 and inhibiting GSK3β. However, mTORC1/S6K1-mediated feedback inhibition after PTEN deletion prevents potent AKT activation.


CONCLUSIONS
A key permissive signal from an unidentified AKT-independent pathway is required for stimulating the neuron-intrinsic growth machinery. Future studies into this complex neuron-intrinsic balancing mechanism involving necessary and permissive signals for axon regeneration is likely to lead to safe and effective regenerative strategies for CNS repair.",Simran Kaur;Yang Hu
